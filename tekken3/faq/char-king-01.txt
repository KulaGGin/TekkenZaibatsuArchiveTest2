This Faq is dedicated to the patient Wives & Girlfriends of Gamers without whom
these moves would not have been found. All moves have been verified or seen by
myself.  If you see a move that is not listed, describe it to me with motions if

become closer to the heart of the gaming industry.  I've scoured Japanese web
pages and bulletin boards to bring you the freshest information.  While I get
moves from many different sources, I can honestly say that EVERY move, EVERY
combo, EVERY multipart, EVERY ESCAPE has been verified by myself.  That is the
main responsibility of a FAQ writer, to ensure that the information that he is
giving out is accurate and not just a collage of "common knowledge" and re-
posts of information seen elsewhere.

On a personal note, thanks go to Tragic for the offer to use your copyright

That being said, ENJOY.

                              THE STORY OF KING

An orphan, who was brought up in King's orphanage, was 24 years old when King
was killed. Seeing that the orphans lost their hope and were at a loss, he wore
the mask in order to keep the orphanage. But he couldn't become very strong
because his technique waslearned just from watching King during his childhood.
And it is Armor King who hesitantly visited him during fight matches, hearing
that King the Second became heir to King. Armor King works as his second. He
knows who killed King, but he thinks that he has to bring up this young man to
be a very strong fighter more than anything else, and that he must prove his
friendship to King. Four years have passed now, and the young man has grown
into a splendid wrestler, King the Second. He was told by Armor King that the
"God of Fighting" killed King. His trembling fists are wet with the tears of
Armor King. He takes Armor King's hands and gave a big nod. A friendship over
generations has come back now.

        The Ali kick is your friend use it liberally against Eddie and Mashers
of all types.  If the ali kick counters, u can get 2 more kicks, if u counter
a left kick, the ali kick will knock them down(go for a ground throw or WS+4)
if you counter a right kick the 5th kick will stun if it connects, use your
favorite combo.
        I usually don't use the jump kicks accept under long distance playing.
        The jail kick is very powerful but the time spent tapping forward you
could do kings turnaround kick for more damage and better ground techniques.
        The flying cross chop can hit mid,low, or high depending on distance,
use it and mix it up with a regular grab or ground grabs (when they start to
get smart and try to duck the regular grab).
        The elbow drop is generally not used accept against Lei or other
players who like to lie down a lot.  The move comes out much faster than TK2.
        The side swipe should NEVER be used, it has no range, speed or juggles.
        The elbow sting is very quick and if it counter hits the opponent will
be knocked to the ground.  Look for the yellow flash of a counter and ground
grab!
        The smash upper is used for keeping the opponent at medium distance.
If it is blocked immediately d+2, hold d and go into the dynamite upper.
        I generally don't use the punches combos unless i'm against a player
who reverses a lot (break up their tempo if you don't continue the 10 hit).
        Use the frankensteiner sparingly, it's very slow takes no damage unless
it's a counter hit, otherwise stay away.
        The savate kicks are good combo breakers and do well against rising
fighters.
        The Turn Around Kick is your second best friend..it's quick, it's hard
to reverse, it takes mucho damage, keeps the opponent in a good zone, and has
decent recovery time.  Use the TA kick at medium to far range to turn around.
A simple right kick while turned is a quick move with big counter damage,
when turned you can go into a quick moonsault press or a Clothesline.  A
major counter TA kick will roll the opponent far, chase them down and punish.
        I don't generally use the clothesline, it moves you way off axis, is
easily seen, has poor recovery.  Don't use it.
        The spinning elbow is an interesting move in that king crouches down
and under high attacks and will yield a big counter.  Used during the side
step will confuse the opposition.  Generally if you use the elbow use the
hand knife also, it has the same recovery time and will always hit if the
elbow connects.
        The dashing knuckle bomb is your third best friend.  If it connects
closely with a counter it will bounce them high for a juggle combo.  If it
connects for a regular counter they will be sent flying, hunt them down.
If it does not hit, it has medium recovery time, go into d+2 as described for
the smash upper.
        The stomach smash should only be used between medium and far distance,
the neutral aspect of the motion will kill you during close fighting.  If you
get the smash ALWAYS press 1+2 afterwards regardless if it was a counterhit or
not.  If it was a counter you grab them, if it wasn't you go into the spinning
elbow.
        The break neck speed is generally used for the same distance as the
stomach smash.  It has excellent damage, is fairly quick, and if is blocked
you will roll out of range for minimal risk.  It seems to have low priority
against other moves.
        The ankle smash is a decent move but i generally only use it when they
are already grounded.   Get the feel for tapping d/f and pressing 1 just as he
gets into a full crouch.  With practice you won't need to crouch and wait to
get the move, his dynamite upper and ali kicks can be done the same way.
        Use the Straight Arrow against players who love to go into strings.
They generally are concentrating on hitting the correct sequences.  If used at
medium fighting distance they will race by you and this move has major counter
damage.
        I generally use the Shoulder sparingly, it has a slow recovery time, use
it at medium to far distances as the opponent is trying to close the gap.
        The crouching sidestep is essentially King's double Mexican multi part
but without King standing up to do the grab.  Why would you want the animation
for that move you ask?  Good players will NOT try to strike you if they see
King do the animation for the SS Grab, it's too easy for the strike to miss
and then be punished by King for all their health.  Good players tend to duck
when they see the animation, simply tap forward and d+1+2 to crouch grab!  By
contrast, if YOU see king SS Grab d+2 will break him out of it.

			            UNBLOCKABLES

Moonsault Press                    [25]  f+1+4
Jaguar Impact                      [50]  f+1+2
Clothesline (WT)                   [50]  1+2
Offensive Power Up                       1+2+3+4

        The Moonsault Press is another of your party of friends.  I use it out
of range to purposely have the opponent come close.  As they get close rise
and kick with left kick (hold down) they will be knocked off their feet and
you can hit with a WS+4, go into another press and start over again.
        The Jaguar Impact is a move to be used at medium distance.  It's slow
easily ducked but takes horrendous damage.  Use it sparingly.
        The Offensive Power Up lasts 5 Seconds or until you are struck.  Gives
guard damage and any hit will be a major counter. You can't block though!!

		      REVERSALS (Can't Reverse Punches)

Spinning Achilles Hold (Left Kick)        b+1+3 - b+2+4
Dragon Screw (Right Kick)                 b+1+3 - b+2+4
Chicken-Out (Counters a reversal)         f+1+3 Reversed Left Punch/Kick
Chicken-Out (Counters a reversal)         f+2+4 Reversed Right Punch/Kick
Low Combo Escape (No Damage)              d - d/b+1+4 - d - d/b+2+3

        Damage for reversals is as follows: 150% of the normal damage amount
for the opponents move you reversed. 
        After the Spinning Achilles Hold tap f~d+1+3-d+2+4.  The reversal
usually gives you enough time to get a ground grab.
        The Dragon Screw will leave the opponent face up, so you must do one
ground grab to bring them face down, and another quick ground grab.
        I have used the Chicken succesfully against reversal happy players.
Generally reversal characters reverse you out of slow points in the 10 hit.
The points are the 4th hit the 6th hit and the 9th hit.  All the ten hits
have the same 4th hit: 1,2,1,1 the player will usually reverse the 4th hit
which is a left punch.  Simply hold forward just after you begin your ten hit
(won't change the combo) and if they reverse the 4th hit tap 1+3 together.
        Use the low combo escape against low kick attacks.  For instance,
Paul's falling leaf combo is d+1,4,2 which is a tile splitter followed by a
spinning sweep followed by a death fist.  Just as you see the tile splitter,
tap d+1+4 and you will push Paul out of his sweep.  King's low escapes are
powerful in that they push the opponent to their knees, which can be followed
by a crouch grab. Low cancelled kick moves do not give enough time for them
to recover, low cancelled punch moves can be followed with a low grab, but
the timing is a lot less forgiving.

                                    Timings

For multiparts - Timing (when you do the next part) is not as important as
tempo (the amount of time in between each group of presses).  Assuming /= 1/4
second pause: 3//1//2//3+4//all MAY work, 3/1//2///3+4~all WILL NOT.  In
general from the time King BEGINS the first part and up until the break and
damage of the first part connecting is the window.  Plenty of time is given.
Notes: if you are doing the jaguar driver > Boston Crab, you must wait until
the opponents feet leave the ground to tap 1+2,3,4,1+2 otherwise the 1+2 of the
first part of the BC will count as the Jaguar press.  Once their feet leave the
ground you can input the next part at ANYTIME before the apex of the driver.
Note2: the rolling deathe cradle must have correct tempo, and has no room for
sloppiness.  All the buttons must be inputted within 3/4 of a second with no
oopseys.  The timing (when) is not important, there is enough time to input
the string almost 2 1/2 times!  Practice: left buttons (thumb and 1st), kicks
(1st and middle), right buttons (thumb and 1st), punches (1st and middle),
1,2,3 (thumb, first, middle) 
Critical Timing: the 1+2 needs to be pressed at the exact instant king's back
touches the ground from breaking the legs, after you press 3+4 for the leg
break, hold button 1 and tap 2 just as before you hear the crunch!

                      MULTIPARTS & THROWS EXPLAINED

The multi-part, the most sought after and fun items in the Namco games arsenal.
In general don't expect to get off a whole lot of ground grabs during the heat
of battle, know the correct times for ground throws.  Lei and Eddie have a
habit of lying down in front of you, otherwise don't bother to memorize moves..
they're all the same control, just dependent of the victims position.  The
crouch throws are good to use against King after you block his last ali kick,
or against Xiang Lou (it will grab her out of the Art of Phoenix), other
players have a tendency to crouch when you get close, punish them.  Nothing
better than a turtling fool that you grab with a  Reverse Full Nelson (this
can be multied from, the powerbomb can't).  For King's arm clutch multi: you
must follow the arm clutch with the backdrop, the german suplex & cannonball
can be interchanged & the Giant Swing & T-Bone Powerbomb can be interchanged,
you must use the powerbomb to GSwing/Tbone if you used the German Suplex, the
GSwing/TBone can follow the Powerbomb or Superfreak, the Cannonball can be
followed by the Powerbomb or the Manhattan Drop, the Superfreak can only follow
the Manhattan Drop. This applies to the Reverse Full Nelson except you cannot
backdrop or German Suplex.  If you Side Step Grab with 2+4 and you grab the
opponent head on, you will get the Reverse Full Nelson which you can follow
the same multi-part.  If the opponent is slightly off axis, you will get the
Cannonball which can be multi-parted also, albeit smaller. King can now pull
of some very hateful breaks after the tackle.  After the 3+4 Tackle/Leg Break,
begin tapping 1+2 quickly for the Arm Locking STF..the exact timing is not yet
known. The Rolling Death Cradle has no breakout after it begins, the rolls
continue to take off health...I rolled 8 times and killed the cpu with this 1
multipart!

			THE ART OF ESCAPING

Counter those throws!!  If you don't like being thrown, then don't be thrown.
All normal throws (throws that don't require a joystick motion) can be
countered simply by pressing either left punches or right punches.  If you get
thrown otherwise, well.. you shouldn't have been standing around long enough
for your opponent to tap the joystick for a power throw. THE accurate way to
escape most multiparts is to tap 2~1(hold)~2, this will escape almost all of
kings grabs (special thanks go out to Might Mort on IRC).

			   HELPFUL HINTS

Know the machine you are playing on.  I don't mind losing to someone who is
better than I am, IF they win with skill, not constant knock-down-footsweep-
pounce or DEFECTIVE CONTROLS.  I've seen some games where the right punch
works, the right kick works, but push both at one time and NOTHING happens.
I've played on games that only have 4 directional (made that way, or just
dirty) joysticks. Hold the joystick down, slowly move the joystick to the
down/for position and NOTE exactly when the character begins crouching
forward. This is the exact joystick position needed for certain power moves:
Ali Kicks, Ankle Smash. DO NOT CROSS THE D/F POSITION. You may also get these
moves by tapping (and Holding) in the d/f position and tapping the
corresponding button JUST as you crouch.

Practice the Dragon Punch.  You know, the SFII Dragon Punch motion f,n,d,d/f
and punch.  You can hold in the D/F position (you have up to @ 1/2 second to
perform the next motion, use this to your advantage to be unpredictable). The
tighter and more precise the circle, the easier it is to get multi-part holds
or the knuckle strike.

                                       EXTRAS
OPENING STANCES (May be controlled, not sure yet)
On knees with back to opponent rise, turn and face to begin round. 
(I believe it is chosen on odd rounds with punches if king has original 
mask, kicks if King has Armor King's mask, even rounds it is opposite.)

1-2 punch and elbow smash then begin round.
(I believe it is chosen on even rounds with punches if king has original 
mask, kicks if King has Armor King's mask, odd rounds it is opposite.)

WINNING STANCES
1- Jump Forward with a Raised Arm
2- Slash Motion Across Throat, Thumbs Down while Growling
3- Three Cheers for King
4- Howling at the Moon

UNIFORMS
1-2 Kings old mask, bare chested, blue tights with gold piping and gold
wrestling shin boots,
3-4 Armor Kings mask with red eye, muscle shirt with "Evil Mishima Product"
on back (in Chinese), blue breaker pants, chain belt, studded wrist guards,
and it looks like Pumas for shoes :)
