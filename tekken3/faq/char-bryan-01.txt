This FAQ was meant as a guide for your Time Attack Needs and not as a moves
list for Bryan Fury.  Using this guide as a Bryan Fury Moves List may result
in severe depression or anxiety.  Reading this FAQ, I am assuming that you
have read lots of Bryan FAQs.  The reason why I wrote this FAQ is because
there are some people who want to learn how to complete the Bryan Time Attack
in under 5 minutes.

If you have heeded my warnings as described in my Morrigan Aensland Guide for
Vampire Savior (Capcom for Arcade and Saturn), then you may have noticed that
I have upgraded to a Domain Account, have paid my InterNIC registration fees,
and I'm currently in transition of trying to update my pages to promote the
newly-registered and paid domain name, Verasnaship.NET!

Listen, all FAQ authors has enough of this bullshit of having their unique works
stolen from their hands.  FAQ stealing is against the law and IT INDEEDS
constitutes a serious criminal act.  All of you lamers (and magazine printers
and editors) need to start making unique work out of your knowledge and not to
attempt stealing FAQ authors' knowledges because I'm definitely against this
rage of FAQ-stealing injustices that has went on for weeks already.  Sauer Kraut
was the first asshole to commit such bullshit last year, and it's time that we
all sober up by creating unique works from now on.

HISTORY OF THE FAQ:

Version 0.07 (13June1998)
Having played Bryan pretty much, I decided to open up a "Bryan Versus the World
FAQ" for all your Time Attack Needs.  Sadly, there are a lot of bugs as this
work is taken from memory.

Version 0.1 (July 5, 1998)
I updated my FAQ in order to promote the newly-registered Verasnaship.NET
domain.  Also, I have pointed out some recommendations to play a Time Attack
Game in Tekken 3 well.  Please note that I may have been using some cuss words
and I do apologize if I had to use 'em.  The reason why is because in the world
of Tekken 3, FAQ stealing is dominant, and it's time that we burn FAQ lamers to
a crisp!

VESTIROTH'S RECOMMENDATIONS

1.   Don't bother using the unblockables, there is no reason for you to use
     them.  Doing so will force the opponent to commit a heavy counterattack
     on you with virtually no escape.

2.   Don't overuse one move as your opponent may try to "spy on you" as you
     habitually do the move.  Afterwards, once your opponent finds out about
     the move that you habitually use, then be prepared for heavy attacks.

3.   Use the Gatling Combination only whenever you need to cover your entire
     front.  There are several quick but defensive attacks that you can use
     to cover Bryan's Front.

4.   Juggles may save you or just waste you time, depending on how you use
     them.  Remember, when done right, the first two spinning punches can
     stun your opponent.

5.   Use 10-Hit Combos only if your opponent pisses you off long enough.  The
     best hard-hitter is b+3,4,1,2,1,4,3,3.  Don't overuse the hard-hitters
     as you can be hit out of the move.

6.   Try to use the Spinning Punches or the Quick Right Punch as soon as the
     match starts.  Although there may be some chance that your opponent may
     react immediately, quick reflexes should guarantee you some decent damage
     at the start of the match.
==============================================================================
JIN KAZAMA
Jin is one of the more powerful characters in the game.  Whenever he tries an
axe kick, then you should block high, then blow him away.  Be careful of the
Rasen Shujin Kyaku since it hits High, Low, Low, Mid (and it can catch you off
guard).  Always attack with caution because Jin has counters.  There are some
attacks (like the Backhand) that can be crouched and countered.  Some of his
attacks are low while his punch combos are incredibly fast.  The Gatling
Attack should provide some good frontal coverage while the quick right should
catch Jin off-guard.  Steer clear of the White Heron moves.

NINA AND ANNA WILLIAMS
Now that's what I call a fight!  Nina and Anna will variate their attacks
often, so be prepared to block or say ouch!  Don't let them use any of their
throws or linking combos on you or that duration would be your last.  As with
Jin Kazama, you should try to attack carefully because they have counters as
well.  Be prepared to feel that feet of the Williamses if you get knocked
down.  Try not to attack high as they may likely counter you with a devastating
combo.  Watch out for some of their combos as they may attack mid, high, low
or even in a zigzag pattern for the worse!  I would go defensive against either
of the two, though.

PAUL PHOENIX
Paul may be a force to be reckoned with because his tree cutting arrow may be
one of the most devastating attacks in the game.  Watch out for the Tile
Breaker because Paul's signaling that he's ready to do either the Deathfist or
the Tree Cutting Arrow.  Also, be careful if he has to use his jumpkicks.
Although Paul may have counters, he shouldn't pose too much of a problem as
long as you are persistent and fast.

HWOARANG
Hwoarang's just kicks and business so anticipating his kick moves should make
him a sitting duck.  Please be aware that his kick moves are fast and nearly
impossible to recover if he gets you in the first hit.  Some of his kick moves
are incredibly powerful so be prepared to block and counter.  I would just go
offensive and mix up moves just a tad bit (or if you are adventurous, variate
everything you have) and keep Hwo on the defensive.  Juggles may be good as
well, so try to juggle if you can with him.

EDDY GORDO
Don't bother to use high attacks on this cheeseball as he mainly stays low all
the time.  I would try low and mid attacks and trying to cover my front with
any attack that seems to be high but hits mid for good defense.  The Sledge-
Hammer would be good, but the Gatling Attack may also provide good frontal
coverage as well.  This is a good time to use a defensive 8-hitter.  I would
try to use the Leg Slicer, but mix it up a little between Gatling Attack, Leg
Slicer, etc. in order to make Eddy less hairy.  His kicks do a lot of damage
so you will need to stay alert of his moves at all times.

LING XIAOYU
Xiaoyu has a bad habit of avoiding you for all of the time and will try to
dodge and attack as soon as she can.  Don't let her Phoenix stance and her
cartwheels bother you.  You may have to try a little side-stepping to confuse
Xiaoyu but don't get too fancy here.  If you get too sloppy, then Xiaoyu will
just try a juggle on you.  She's one aggressive attacker (and is the fastest
fighter in the game) so it's important that you block all of her attacks from
the first hit.  I would go defensive on this youngster.

LEI WULONG
Lei is one of the more powerful characters in the game as he can variate his
play dead, turn around, and his Wuxing stances for incredible variety.  Also
to be afraid of is his kicks, which do a good amount of damage.  There are
some moves that you have to watch out for (i.e. Chusaigatsuki), since Lei can
go either on a Turn Around or a Play Dead Stance if he prefers.  Although Lei
is not bright with his Play Dead, you still must use extreme caution when
okizeme'n him.  Don't let Lei fool you with his drunken attack.  Keep your
distance if he has to do this.  If you can stay aggressive most of the time,
then Lei shouldn't be fancy on you.

Dr. BOSCANOVITCH
Don't bother using anything but low attacks.  When laying down, Boscanovitch
can be cheap, but he isn't bright.  Just keep blasting him away with your Leg
Slicer Attacks and steer clear of his bad breath attacks and you should be ok.

YOSHIMITSU
When Yoshimitsu begins to use a dizzy left kick, he's signaling you that he's
about to use a mid right kick so counter him the instant you see that spinning
left.  React too slow and you will say ouch.  Yoshimitsu needs some time to
activate his piercing screaming fist but be aware that Yo-Man may prefer to
use the Fan Cutter instead.  Be aware that when Yo-Man does the Poison Flip,
he's signaling that he will be doing a spiral backfist, into a backflip, and
into a screaming fist.  There are combos that you have to watch out for and
if you can block all the hits (and not letting him use his sword), then you
should be ok.

FOREST LAW
Forest is the most ANNOYING opponent you'll ever fight.  The reason why this
is so is because you have to deal with his flip kicks pretty often.  Since
nearly all of his moves hit at the same location, there's no excuse why you
shouldn't block and counter.  After a failed flip kick combo, you can just
(for a laugh) deck him with a 8-string ending with a Southern Cross.  Use the
fast right to divert him and the Gatling Attack to cover your front.  Using
the Sledgehammer is helpful too.

KUMA AND PANDA
Kuma has the longest reach in the game.  It's important that you don't give
her a chance to deck you with any of her hits or that hit could be your last.
Don't let her throw you either.  I would just variate my hits (or use quick
attacks) offensively.

JULIA CHANG
Fight Julia like you would fight Michelle as Bruce in Tekken 2.  Block all of
her hits and counter with harsh combos.  You have a greater reach than Julia
does and using the uppercut, leg slicer, and the facebreaker should put you
in the offensive.  Be aware that Julia can confuse you as well and don't give
her a chance to use any of her throws.

GUN JACK
Gun Jack is much stronger than Jack-2 or Prototype Jack.  I would fight Gun
Jack the same way as I would fight Kuma but be aware that Gun Jack has a better
variety than Kuma, though.  Since his hits are slow, you should have no problem
reacting but be aware of the clapper because that's when he may confuse you.
Also, watch out for moves that Gun Jack can use that vary to many degrees.

HEIHACHI MISHIMA
Heihachi is one of the more powerful characters in the game.  The reason for
this is because he has all of his moves from Tekken 2 and have added some new
ones.  As opposed to Jin, Heihachi's WGF hits mid, so block it or say ouch.
Also, Heihachi has more juggle moves than Jin does, so don't give Hei a chance
to juggle you.  Be aware when attacking him with right kicks because he may
use his Mishima Execution on you.  Your main concern is the Geta Stomp, which
he likes to use when you are on the canvas.  Make sure you block his Rasen
Shujin Kyaku and his Hell Axle at all times, then counter if you want.  Don't
let him fool you with his Axe Kicks or his fancier uppercuts, but be aware of
his Nakaruba Rai because he may launch additional attacks as opposed to Jin's.
The key to fighting Heihachi is persistence and variety.

TOSHIN
Don't let Toshin use his infinity kicks or that hit could be your last.  Since
he has lots of moves from Tekken 2, you must be aware that Toshin can variate
hits up and down to confuse the hell out of you.  Also, the Snake Combination
must be steered clear of.  If Toshin tries his Whirlwind Fairy on you, block
both hits high, and then punish him with a heavy-damaging move.  If Toshin
uses his Shin Kick, you can block the first hit, duck the second hit, and then
(for a laugh) either juggle or gut-choke him.  Since Toshin has a lot of
unblockables, prepare to take some damage.

SHIN TOSHIN
Fight Shin Toshin like you would with Toshin, but since Shin Toshin is huge,
his abilities are slightly hurt, but that doesn't stop him from using his
Inferno and Ogre Blaster moves on you.  Dodge these two moves like you would
with Oni No Kazuya in Tekken 2.  If you block all hits, move fast, and stay
persistent, then Shin Toshin shouldn't be too hard to beat.

KING THE SECOND
When King throws you, be aware that he can instantly kill you with his multi-
parts.  Watch out for his stagger kick because he may always trick you with
an uppercut.  Stay clear of the gut punch because if he happens to counter,
chances are that he may wish to throw you, which is not good.  Also, he has
a bad habit of using his backhand to lunge punch and his unblockable Leg Bomb.
His 10-hitters are otherwise noticeable by the expert player.

MOKUJIN
Since Mokujin will randomly switch characters throughout the match, you must
change your strategies according to the stances Mokujin performs at the start
of the round.  Please read SurfBard's Tekken 3 FAQ for the description of the
stances.

GON
Since Gon is small, I would use the Leg Slicer and low to mid attacks on him.
You can brutalize him by using repeative Leg Slicers, but since his range is
so mediocre (and much of the fact that you can for a laugh brutalize him on
the ground infinitely), I'll leave Gon up to you for now.

VS YOUR CLONE
Now that's what I call a fight!  Your clone has the same reflexes as you so
be prepared to block all hits!  His sledgehammer is quick and some of his
side-stepping moves are unpredictable so be prepared to react at all costs!
Since his variety is adequate, you may have to consider going on defense
rather than on offense.
