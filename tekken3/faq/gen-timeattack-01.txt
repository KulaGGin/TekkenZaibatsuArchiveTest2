Time Attack scores, you must get permission from the author, me.  This 
means that if you want to write your own FAQ with any of the strategies
contained herein, you must get permission from either me or whoever
submitted the strategy.  Some of them are common knowledge, like
Heihachi's [wgf, unblockable] or variation and Yoshimitsu's [f+2, 
f,f+3+4,1+2,3+4], but there are some that aren't common knowledge, 
and I would appreciate it if you would give credit where it's due.
Distribution of this FAQ is allowed as long as it is not altered in any

WHY A TIME ATTACK FAQ?
----------------------
This FAQ is for anyone who even remotely cares about Time Attack mode
in Tekken 2, Tekken 3 or Tekken Tag Tournament.  Various strategies
have been discovered by me and other people that can defeat the
computer in the fastest time possible.  I am writing this FAQ to help
all of you out there, the readers, to improve your Time Attack scores.

Hey...I need the competition ;)

A couple of things before we start, you will notice the following move
listed several times while reading this FAQ...U/F,N,4...if you don't
know what this move is or what it looks like, then download a demo
movie I had prepared by Agent 316 for this very purpose!!  It is
located in the Movies section of Tekken Time Attack Central.

I use U/F,N,4 because it does tons of damage and sets everything
else following it up nicely.  I press 1 or 2 after it hits to
take the computer out of their pre-programmed game (they just
stand there if you do an unblockable after the jab) and because
if you don't, they will hit you ;)

All these strategies work and have been thouroughly tested by me.
I used them to get the times you see on my webpage!!  Some are vague
and some are very specific, but they don't work 100% of the time.
Sometimes the computer will attack when they aren't supposed to and
it can get very frustrating.  So don't spend too much time playing
Time Attack...I am not responsible for any damage to you, your
Playstation or anything else while using the information in this FAQ.

Let's begin!!

Problem characters [Ling, Julia]

PSX Stage[1-3]:
     - U/F,N,4, d/f+1,2,1,2,3,3,1,2,1,4
       They all hit if you are close enough.  If it is blocked, you can
       stop the 10-string and take a hit or rely on luck and finish it
       hoping that the last 5 hits connect.
PSX Stage[4-5]:
     - U/F,N,4, d/f+1,2, d/f+1,2, u/f+4, (JG) f+3,4
PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 2)
     - U/F,N,4, 1, d/f+3,1,4,2,4 or d/f+1,2,1,4,2,4
       If they duck the 5-string, you are going to get hit, so use
       PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 1) instead.
     NOTE:  [d/f+1,2,1,4,2,4] is only reliable on Stages 1-3
     Credit:  Chris J. Mast (Gondee) [d/f+3,1,4,2,4]
     - d+3 if necessary
PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 3)
     - U/F,N,4, 1, d/f+3,1,4,2,3 or d/f+1,2,1,4,2,3
       If they duck the 5-string, you are going to get hit, so use
       PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 1) instead.
     NOTE:  [d/f+1,2,1,4,2,3] is only reliable on Stages 1-3
     Credit:  Chris J. Mast (Gondee) [d/f+3,1,4,2,3]
     - d/f+1,2 if necessary
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 1)
     - U/F+4, (JG) f+3,4 (50+ damage!!)
     Credit:  Chris J. Mast (Gondee)
     - repeat as they get up
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 2)
     - d/f+1,2
     - hesitate while holding F (for CH)
       You hold forward to inch closer so you don't miss and to get
       the Counter Hit.  Use this same strategy with Nina.
     - repeat (F~d/f+1,2)

Arcade: (Anna is only accessable in Tekken 3 Arcade by pressing Start
         when selecting Nina;  See Arcade Nina Williams)

Problem characters [none]

PSX Stage[All]:
     - U/F,N,4
       This move sets up the whole thing whether it knocks them down
       or not.  If it knocks them down, either behind you or in front
       of you, run up and press d+1 as they get up, then continue
       from there.
     - d+1, WS+4
       This is the most important move, if it is blocked, they will
       hit you out of your unblockable.  You must do it again either
       by itself or preceeded by another d+1.  If it whiffs, just go
       ahead and do the unblockable, it should hit anyways.
     - b+1+4
     - d+4 if necessary
     - d+3 if still necessary
PSX Stage[1-3]:
     - U/F,N,4, d+1, WS+3, d/f+1
       Use d/f+1 whether it stuns them or not.  If it's blocked,
       then revert to d+1, WS+4, b+1+4 immediately because they are
       going to attack you.
     - b+1+4
     - d+4 if necessary

Arcade Stage[All]:
     - f,f+2
     - f,f,F
       Run up to their fallen body and stop just out of range of being
       hit by an Ankle Kick.
     - b+1+4
     - d+4 if necessary
       You can use d/f+3 but any character with an Ankle Kick can hit
       you out of it.

PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack, Kuma, True Ogre] (Method 1)
     - f,f+2
       If blocked, try again or just wait for an opening.
     - f,f,F
       Run up to their fallen body and stop just out of range of being
       hit by a Sweep or Ankle Kick.
     - b+1+4
     - f,f+2 when they get up.  You don't have time to press d/f+3.
PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack, Kuma, True Ogre] (Method 2)
     - u/f+4
       If blocked, try again immediately or just wait for an opening.
     - b+1+4
     - f,f+2 when they get up.  You don't have time to press d/f+3.

Arcade Exceptions: [Gun Jack, Kuma, Bryan, Heihachi, Ogre, True Ogre]
     - f,f+2
     - f,f,F
       Run up to their fallen body and stop just out of range of being
       hit by a Sweep or Ankle Kick.
     - b+1+4
     - d/f+3 if necessary
       This move is safe because none of these characters have an
       Ankle Kick or faster move to hit you out of it.

Problem characters [Paul, Bryan, King, Heihachi, Ogre]

For all methods and stages:
  Start round 1 by:
     - holding X before Round 1 to start standing
     Credit:  Notti
  Start round 2 by:
     - pressing 4 to stand up
       Expect to get hit while you are getting up.
       You start laying down no matter what...
PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 1)
     - f+1, b+1+2
     - wait for 2 seconds, then 3+4 to charge up
     - u/f+1~3,3,f+3,3,3
       You usually don't need this many kicks, but use them just in case.
       It's easier just to hold forward the whole time instead of worrying
       about pressing it on the 3rd kick.
PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 2)
     - f+1, b+1+2
     - SS behind them, then wait until they have around 50% life or they
       start to break out of the unblockable.
     - 1+4,1+2 (back throw)
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 1)
     - u/f+2, (JG) u/f+1,d
       Press down right as Dr.B lands from the Thunder Oldfist to
       parry/recover, otherwise he will be stunned and you have to
       recover him.
     Credit:  Notti [u/f+1,d]
     - repeat as they get up
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 2)
     - u/f+2, (JG) u/f+2
     - repeat as they get up
     NOTE:  This is for those of you who have a hard time with Method 1.

Arcade: (Dr.B is only available in Tekken 3 for the Playstation)

PSX Exceptions: [none]

Eddy Gordo
-=-=--=-=-
Problem characters [Ling, Anna, Paul, Heihachi, Ogre]

PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 1)
     - U/F,N,4, 1, 3
     - repeat
PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 2)
     - U/F,N,4, 1, 3, d/b+3+4
       Not so reliable, but it works!!  Method 1 is easier.
PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 3)
     - U/F,N,4, 1,2, f+3, (HSP) D+3+4, (JG)(HSP) 4
       It should be over now, but if not you have a two options.
  Option 1:
     - Walk forward in Handstand Position (HSP), then when you see them
       twitch press D+3+4 to juggle with (HSP) 4 again if necessary.
  Option 2:
     - Let the joystick go Neutral until Eddy goes into Relaxed
       Position (RLX), then press 4~3 and go from there or press
       d+3 to go to Relaxed Position (RLX) and press 4~3.
  NOTE:  It would seem that Method 3 is not worth the effort, but
         it is a better and faster option than Method 2 when it works.
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 1)
     - U/F,N,4
       If it doesn't knock them down, then do PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 3).
     - u/f+4 or U/F,N,4 as they get up
     - repeat when they get up or at any opportunity.
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 2)
     - U/F,N,4
       If it doesn't knock them down, then do PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 3).
     - b+4,4 (CH) as they get up.
       This works about half the time, the rest of the time they duck.
       But it only takes 2 of these to win!!

Arcade: (Use the same tactics listed for the Playstation except that
         instead of Stage[1-5], it works only on Stage[1-3] and for
         Stage[6-10], use them on Stage[4-10] instead)

Arcade and PSX Exceptions: [none]

Forest Law
-=-=--=-=-
Problem characters [Ling, Julia]

PSX Stage[All]:
     - U/F+4,3, d/b+1+2
       This is a little tricky.  Depending on how far away you are, they
       will either backroll causing you to miss and eat an attack, or
       you will get interrupted by an Ankle Kick.  If this is to be
       successful, both of those situations must be avoided.  You can do
       this by pressing f,f then b,b then d/b+1+2 to make them attack you
       while you're unblockable rips a hole in their chest, or you can
       get lucky.  Sometimes you can just do the unblockable and they
       just lay there, and sometimes they get up dumbfounded and get hit.
       But this works and is how I got 2'12"33 with him, so you might
       want to check it out!!
PSX Stage[1-5]:
     - b+1,2
	NOTE:  The next 2 steps are optional.
     - b+1,2
     - 1 (not the launcher from b+1,2,1;  Just a jab)
       These are to chip away at their health and the jab is to
       interrupt their attack.
     - d/b+2, (BK) 2, b+2, d+2,3
     - (JG) d+2,3 if necessary
     NOTE:  This is a lot of steps, I know...but it works really well
            on both the Playstation and the Arcade.
PSX Stage[6-10]:
     - U/F+4,3
     - repeat as they get up

Arcade Stage[All]:
     - b+1,2, d/b+2, (BK) 2, b+2, d+2,3, (JG) d+2,3
     NOTE:  I haven't played Arcade Tekken 3 in years, but I'm pretty
            sure that you need to do b+1,2 first to chip at their health.

Arcade: (You can use the same tactics listed for the Playstation except
         that instead of PSX Stage[1-5], use Arcade Stage[All] instead.)

Arcade and PSX Exceptions: [none]

Gon

Problem characters [none] (Gon is a problem character)

NOTE:  Gon is a piece of crap.  I don't even care to play him except to
       get a better time if someone beats mine.  I'll keep it short.

PSX Stage[All]:
     - F+1+2,1+2,1+2
     - hesitate (for CH)
     - repeat
     NOTE:  It helps if you hold f+2, then press 1,1,1.

PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack, Kuma, True Ogre]
     - 4~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~3+4
       It's easier to press 4~3+4~3+4~3+4~3+4~3+4~3+4~3+4
     - repeat
     NOTE:  You must be close for the flame to hit.  This only an
            alternative if you have trouble with the other technique.
            It is not faster.

Arcade: (Gon is only available in Tekken 3 for the Playstation)

--------
Gun Jack
-=-==-=-
Problem characters [Julia, Heihachi, Ogre]

PSX Stage[All]:
     - f+2, f+1+2
       Sometimes they block, just do it again.
     - hesitate 1/4 second, 1+2
       If you don't wait, the attack will miss.
     - 3+4
     - d/b+1 if necessary
PSX Stage[1-5]:
     - f+2, f+4~1
       There can't be much delay between moves or you'll get hit.

Arcade: (Use the same tactics listed for the Playstation except that
         instead of Stage[1-5], it works only on Stage[1-3])

Arcade and PSX Exceptions: [none]

Heihachi Mishima
-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-
Problem characters [Julia]

PSX Stage[All]:
     - wgf, (JG) 1, f,F+1, f,F+1
       You have a 2 frame advantage (I think) by holding forward when
       you dash in and jab.  So it's easier to get those jabs.
     - d+1+4
     NOTE:  If you don't do 3 or more jabs, they could just lay on the
            ground and avoid the unblockable.  They might anyways.
PSX Stage[1-2]: (Method 1)
     - f,f, 1,2, 1, d+1 (CH), d+1+4
     Credit:  Adric Vikuckis (Toshinjin)
     - u/f+4~3 if necessary
PSX Stage[3-5]: (Method 1)
     - f,f, 1,2, d+1 (CH), d+1+4
     Credit:  Adric Vikuckis (Toshinjin)
     - u/f+4~3 if necessary
PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 2)
     - b+2, 1, hesitate 1/4 second, d/f+1
       If you don't wait, they will hit you out of the unblockable.
       If it wasn't a Counter Hit, they probably will anyways.
     - d+1+4
     - u/f+4~3 if necessary

Arcade Stage[1-3]:
     - wgf, 1, d+1
       The 1 is to push them away so they won't try to hit you when you
       do the unblockable.
     - d+1+4
       They will try to attack right before the unblockable hits.
Arcade Stage[4-10]:
     - wgf, 1 (optional), d+1+4
       To ensure that they tech roll into the unblockable, hesitate
       slightly before doing the unblockable.  But don't wait too long.

PSX Exceptions: [Eddy]
     - b+2, d/f+1, hesitate 1/4 second, d/f+1
       If you don't wait, they will hit you out of the unblockable.
       If it wasn't a Counter Hit, they probably will anyways.
     - d+1+4
     - u/f+4~3 if necessary
PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack on Stage[1-5], Kuma on Stage[1-5]]
     - wgf, d+1, d+1, d+1+4
       If you're not fast enough, they will tech roll.
PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack on Stage[6-8], Kuma on Stage[6-8], True Ogre]
     - wgf, d+1+4
       It should be over now, if not hit them quickly.

Arcade Exceptions: [none]

Hwoarang
-=-==-=-
Problem characters [Bryan, Eddy, Ling, Anna, Julia, Kuma, Nina,
                    Gun Jack, True Ogre] - Everyone is a bastard!!

PSX Stage[1-3]:
     - f+4,4, (RFF) f+3,3,3,3
       You want to get a Counter Hit, but it's ok if you don't.  You will
       sometimes get hit before f+3 will hit.  Paul will duck sometimes.
     - (JG) b+3 or 3,3,4,(RFS) 3
PSX Stage[4-5]:
     - U/F,N,4
       If this move is blocked, make sure you block because they are
       going to attack.  If this happens, skip the next step.
     - 1,2, f,N,d,d/f+4, (JG) U/F,4
       Big jump, then kick on the way up.  You want to delay this kick
       until they are on the way down so your kick hits their feet and
       not their back.  This is because if you kick their back, you
       will be too close to them when they land and you will get hit
       out of your unblockable.  If you do happen to kick their back,
       juggle with 1 to push them away then do the unblockable.
       Otherwise, just proceed normally.
     NOTE:  It's very important where this kick hits.
     - d/b+3+4
     - f,f+3 as they get up if necessary
PSX Stage[6-7]:
     - U/F,N,4
       If this knocks them down, wait until they get up then proceed
       with step 3 of PSX Stage[4-5].  If it doesn't knock them down,
       then proceed with step 2 of PSX Stage[4-5].
PSX Stage[8-10]:
     - U/F,N,4
       This almost always knocks them down, then they tech roll...this
       is very good news, you can continue.  If they don't fall, then
       you have a problem.  Try d/f+1 then f,N,d,d/f+4.
     - d/b+3+4
       Only do this if they were knocked down by the previous move.
     - d/b+3+4
       You might have to dash forward to get in range.
     - f,f+3 if necessary
       You can use f,f+4 if they tech roll, but it's harder to time.

Arcade: (Use the same tactics listed for the Playstation)

Arcade and PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack, Kuma, Ogre, True Ogre]
  On f,N,d,d/f+4 connect:
  [for Gun Jack, Kuma or True Ogre]
     - (JG) d+1, WS+4,4, d/b+3+4
  [for Ogre]
     - (JG) 1,2, d/b+3+4
  Then either: (if necessary)
     - d/b+3+4
       Press f,f to get closer if you are too far away.
  Or:
     - f,f+3 as they get up
Arcade and PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack Stage[6-8], Kuma Stage[6-8], True Ogre]
     - U/F,N,4 (Knock down), d/b+3+4, d/b+3+4
       For the 2nd unblockable, dash forward if you are too far away.

Jin Kazama
-=-=--=-=-
Problem characters [Ling, Lei, Julia]

PSX Stage[All]:
     - U/F,N,4, d/f+1,2
       On Stages 6-10, do this whether it knocks them down or not,
       just do it as they get up instead.
     - d/f+1,2, b,f+2,1,2
       Usually this is a Counter Hit.
     NOTE:  b,f+2,1,2 finishes them off faster and hurts more than
            b,f+2,1,d+2 but do whatever you're comfortable with.
     - u/f+4~3 if necessary
PSX Stage[1-5]:
     - 1+2+3+4, b,f+2 (CH)
       Time the move right when you see Jin start to stand up..
     - B+1+4
     NOTE:  This method is not very reliable on the Playstation, but
            it does work sometimes.  I would save this technique for
            the Arcade version of Tekken 3.

Arcade Stage[All]:
     - 1+2+3+4, b,f+2 (CH)
       This will always hit if you're fast enough.  Time the move right
       when you see Jin start to stand up..
     - B+1+4
       The unblockable will hit them on the ground almost every time.

PSX Exceptions: [Ling]
     - Inbetween moves, she sometimes hits you out of them, just repeat
       the move you got hit out of and you should be fine.
PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack, Kuma, True Ogre]
     - If you get a Counter Hit with b,f+2,1 and they have 50% or more
       life, stop there and do Jin's big unblockable, B+1+4.
       Or you can set it up like this:
          - 1+2+3+4, b,f+2,1 (CH) or b,f+2 (CH)
            Either one of these work great.
          - B+1+4

Arcade Exceptions: [none]

Problem characters [Anna, Bryan]

PSX Stage[1-5]:
     - U/F,N,4, 1, d/f+4
       Usually this is a Counter Hit.
     - f+1+4
     - (JG) U/F,N,4 if necessary
       On big characters, do the unblockable again instead.
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 1)
     - U/F,N,4, u/f+4
       You can add a jab before the jump kick if you want to.
     - (JG) 1, d,d/f+1,2
     - repeat the juggle when they get up or tech roll.

Arcade Stage[All]: (Method 1)
     - Walk forward a little, then press d/f+2,1
       If it doesn't hit, try again.
     - f+1+4
       Sometimes it's over at this point, you lucky dog!!
  if it juggles:
     - (JG) U/F,4
     - (JG) d,d/f+1,2 if necessary
  if not:
     - f+1+4
       They will try to get up and the unblockable will hit.
Arcade Stage[All]: (Method 2)
     - Walk forward a little, then press d/f+2,1
       If it doesn't hit, try again.
     - f+1+4, f+1+4
       They will either tech roll and get hit or try to attack before
       the unblockable hits.  Do it whether the unblockable juggles
       or not, it will hit.
     NOTE:  This method should be used for big characters.

PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack, Kuma, True Ogre]
  NOTE:  The unblockable hits them even when they are laying down.

Arcade Exceptions: [Gun Jack, Kuma, True Ogre]

Problem characters [Julia, Hwoarang, Heihachi, Ogre]

PSX Stage[1-5]:
     - U/F,N,4, 2,1, 1+2,1
       It helps to hold 2 when you first press it, then press the 1's
       like you normally would.  [hold 2, then press 1, 1,1]
     - U/F+2+4
       They might roll away or tech roll causing you to miss.
       But it's not likely if you're fast enough.
     - 3 if necessary
PSX Stage[6-10]:
     - u/f+4, (JG) 2,1, 1+2,1
     - repeat as they get up

Arcade Stage[1-3]: (Method 1)
     - f+2+3
     - repeat
Arcade Stage[1-3]: (Method 2)
     - f+4,d/f+3, f+4,d/f+3
       If the f+4 knocks them down, you should try to make them attack
       you as they get up (make sure you get out of the way when they do),
       then press f+2+3.
     - f,f+4
Arcade Stage[1-3]: (Method 3)
     - f,f (to get close), 2,1, 2,1, 1+2,1, u/f+2+4
     - 3 if necessary
Arcade Stage[4-10]:
  See PSX Stage[6-10]

Arcade and PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack, Kuma, True Ogre]
     - u/f+4, (JG) 2,1, 1+2,1, f+2+3
       You have to be fast!!
     - f+2+3
       It hits them as they get up.
     NOTE:  The 2nd f+2+3 is only needed on the PSX.

Problem characters [Heihachi, Ogre, True Ogre]

PSX Stage[1-5]:
     - U/F,N,4, f+1, f+1+2, b,f+2+3
       They should be finished, if not then hit them quick!!
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 1)
     - f+1, f+1+2, b,f+2+3
       Now run after them and hit them quick!!
     NOTE:  Heihachi and Ogre block the f+1+2 all the time.
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 2)
     - U/F,N,4 (Knockdown), f+1+2, b,f+2+3
       If they aren't finished, hit them quick!!
     NOTE:  If the kick doesn't knock them down, use PSX Stage[1-5].

Arcade: (Use the same tactics listed for the Playstation except that
         instead of Stage[1-5], it works only on Stage[1-3] and for
         Stage[6-10], use them on Stage[4-10] instead)

Arcade and PSX Exceptions: [Gun Jack, Kuma, True Ogre]
     NOTE:  This is just an alternative method and isn't much faster.
     - f+1, f+1+2, b,d/b,d,d/f+2 (CH)
       Now run, shoulder ram, then quickly hit them again if necessary.

Lei Wulong
-=-=--=-=-
It took me over a year to get 2'15"41 with Lei.  I was trying to outdo
my friend Jeremy's time of 2'21"65 that he got the first time he tried.
I was just going to give up until Chris J. Mast e-mailed me and told me
that he had a better Lei time, so I gave it a shot and 2 weeks later
I beat it.  Lei is one of the hardest and most frustrating characters
to get a good time with.  So good luck to you!!

Problem characters [Julia, Ling, Nina, Anna, Bryan, Heihachi, Ogre]

PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 1)
     - U/F,N,4, 1, 3,3 (CH)
       This will almost always hit on Counter Hit.
  then either:
     - d+4~d when they are on the ground
     - (SNA) 2,2,2 as they get up
       This takes practice to hit them because if you're too early,
       they will stay down and hit you when you're done attacking, and
       if you're too late, they will block.
  or:
     - f,N,1,2,1,2,3_4 as they get up
       This also takes practice to hit for the same reason.
  or:
     - Bait them into attacking when they get up and after you dodge
       their attack, press d/b+4,4 or d/b+4 then juggle with 4~4,3,3.
PSX Stage[1-5]: (Method 2)
     - f+3, f+3, f+3,3 (CH)
       This doesn't always work, but it's the fastest option.
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 1)
     - U/F,N,4
       If it knocks them down, do it again.  If not then do the same
       thing you did for Stage[1-5] (Method 1).
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 2)
     - u/f+4, (JG) 3
     - repeat as they get up or tech roll
PSX Stage[8-10]:
     - Do a move that knocks them down.
  like:
     - U/F,N,4
  or:
     - u/f+4, (JG) 3
  then:
     - 3,3 (CH) as they get up or tech roll
       You have about an 80% chance that they will try to attack you
       as they are getting up, so it's worth it.
     NOTE:  This sometimes works for Stages 6 and 7.

Arcade: (Use the same tactics listed for the Playstation except that
         instead of Stage[1-5], it works only on Stage[1-3] and for
         Stage[6-10], use them on Stage[4-10] instead)

Ling Xiaoyu
-=-=-=-=-=-
Problem characters [Lei (o_O), Nina, Anna, Eddy, Julia, Gun Jack, Kuma]

PSX Stage[All]: (Method 1)
     - f+3, f,f+4
       Do the 2nd kick when they land, not before and don't wait too long.
       When they get hit, they should be turned around.
     - f,f+1+2,1+2
       You have to do this fast.
     - f+3
     NOTE:  This method is slightly faster that Method 2, but it is
            harder and less reliable.
PSX Stage[All]: (Method 2)
     - f+3, f,f+4
       Do the 2nd kick when they land, not before and don't wait too long.
     - repeat immediately after the 2nd kick hits

Arcade: (Use the same tactics listed for the Playstation)

Arcade and PSX Exceptions: [Lei]
  NOTE:  When you do f,f+4, sometimes he does (PLD) 3+4, So be careful!!

Mokujin
-=-=-=-
The most important part of getting a good time with Mokujin is to
know what character you are, plus a little luck on getting fast
characters.  Then use the strategies as explained in this guide.

NOTE:  Mokujin does not impersonate Anna, Ogre, True Ogre, Dr.B or Gon!!

-------------
Nina Williams
-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Problem characters [Ling]

PSX Stage[All]:
     - d/f+1,2
     - hesitate while holding F (for CH)
       You hold forward to inch closer so you don't miss and to get
       the Counter Hit.  Use this same Stragety with Anna.
     - repeat (F~d/f+1,2)
PSX Stage[1-5]:
     - U/F,N,4
     - Do any of Nina's 10-strings
       [d/f+1,2,1,2,3,3,2,1,2,4 works the best]
       They all hit if you are close enough.  If it is blocked, you can
       stop the 10-string and take a hit or rely on luck and finish it
       hoping that the last few hits connect.
     NOTE:  Sometimes this doesn't work on Stages 4 and 5.
PSX Stage[8-10]:
     - f,f+1+2
       You can use any move to knock them down, but you need to be able
       to run up to them as they are getting up.  If this is a Counter
       Hit, then run and shoulder ram them.
     - f+2,f+1+2 as they get up
       Press and hold f+2 then press 1 immediately.  Repeat this as they
       get up or tech roll.
     NOTE:  This works great on Heihachi and Ogre.  Sometimes it works on
            Stages 6 and 7.

Arcade Stage[1-3]:
     - 1+2+3+4, f,f+3 (CH), d/b+1+2
     NOTE:  This technique even works on later stages if you're lucky!!
            That's how I got 1'40"65 with her.
Arcade Stage[4-10]:
     - backdash and wait for a second
     - f,f+3 (CH)
       This works about 60% of the time and the timing takes a little
       getting used to, but it does work.  You have to be lucky too!!
     - d/b+1+2

Problem characters [Lei]

PSX Stage[All]:
     - f,f+2
     - wait until they are on the ground, then press u/f+1+2~D.
       If you don't wait, the unblockable will miss.  If you wait too
       long though, you will get hit.
     - u/f+1+2~D
     NOTE:  Sometimes they will hit you out of the unblockable.
PSX Stage[1-3]:
     - f,f, FC+3,3,N+3, (JG) 4, f,f+1+2
       Dash in just to be sure all of the kicks hit.
     Credit:  Chris J. Mast (Gondee)
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 1)
     - u/f+4, (JG) 2, b+2+3
     NOTE:  Sometimes they will just lay on the ground.
     - f+2 when they get up
PSX Stage[6-10]: (Method 2)
     - f+2, u/f+4, (JG) 2, b+2+3
     NOTE:  Sometimes they will just lay on the ground.

Arcade: (Use the same tactics listed for the Playstation except that
         instead of Stage[1-5], it works only on Stage[1-3] and for

Problem characters [Anna, Bryan, Julia, Ling, Hwoarang, Heihachi, Ogre]

PSX Stage[1-5]:
     - f+2, b+1+2
       If they aren't finished, you have 2 options.
  Very little life left:
     - run after them immediately and slide into them.
  A slide wouldn't do it:
     - wait until they are far away (2 normal screens away), then
       begin your run and shoulder ram them.
     NOTE:  My advice would be to start over if the unblockable does
            not finish them off.  Each time it happens, you lose 3
            or more seconds.
PSX Stage[6-8]: (Method 1)
     - f,f, 1,2
     - hesitate for 1/4 second, d/f+4 (CH), b+1+2
       You wait so you can get a Counter Hit.  This is the only thing that
       works good, and it's not that good.  Take it or leave it!!
     Credit:  Brith [d/f+4 (CH), b+1+2]
PSX Stage[8-10]: (Method 2)
     - u/f+4
       You can use u/f+3 instead, but it doesn't juggle as high.
     - (JG) 1,2, b+1+2
     NOTE:  Sometimes they just lay on the ground.  Heihachi can tech
            roll and hit you with d+2 if you're not fast enough.

Arcade: (Use the same tactics listed for the Playstation except that
         instead of Stage[1-5], it works only on Stage[1-3] and for

     - f,f+3+4,1+2,3+4

PSX Exceptions: [Eddy, Ling, Julia] (Method 1)
     - f+2
     - dash in for a back throw
       You have to be fast for this to work.
PSX Exceptions: [Eddy, Ling, Julia] (Method 2)
     - f+2, f,f+3+4
       Hold back to turn around instead of trying to hit them,
       they will attack you first.
     - repeat
PSX Exceptions: [Julia]
     NOTE:  This is assuming that the 2nd hit of the Shark Attack
            misses, but the 3rd juggles.
     - f+2, f,f+3+4,(1+2),3+4
  Then either:
     - (JG) U/B,4
