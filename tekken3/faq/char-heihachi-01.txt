This FAQ was meant as a guide for your Time Attack Needs and not as a moves
list for Heihachi Mishima.  Using this guide as a Heihachi Mishima Moves List
may result in severe depression or anxiety.  Reading this FAQ, I am assuming
that you have read a premium Heihachi Mishima moves list.  The reason why I
wrote this FAQ is because there are some people who want to learn how to finish
a Heihachi Mishima Time Attack game in under 5 minutes.

If you have heeded my warnings as described in my Morrigan Aensland Guide for
Vampire Savior (Capcom for Arcade and Saturn), then you may have noticed that
I have upgraded to a Domain Account, have paid my InterNIC registration fees,
and I'm currently in transition of trying to update my pages to promote the
newly-registered and paid domain name, Verasnaship.NET!

Listen, all FAQ authors has enough of this bullshit of having their unique works
stolen from their hands.  FAQ stealing is against the law and IT INDEEDS
constitutes a serious criminal act.  All of you lamers (and magazine printers
and editors) need to start making unique work out of your knowledge and not to
attempt stealing FAQ authors' knowledges because I'm definitely against this
rage of FAQ-stealing injustices that has went on for weeks already.  Sauer Kraut
was the first asshole to commit such bullshit last year, and it's time that we
all sober up by creating unique works from now on.  Sorry for the profanity
that I have to use as I had to show my anger for those FAQ-lamers out there.

HISTORY OF THE FAQ:

Version 0.05 (21June1998)
I found Heihachi to be a lot more powerful than he was during Tekken 2.  He was
restored to his "bad old self" right after he got promoted to his old position
in the game.  To show my appreciation playing as Heihachi, this is the result.

Version 0.1 (July 5, 1998)
I updated my FAQ in order to promote the newly-registered Verasnaship.NET
domain.  Also, I have pointed out some recommendations to play a Time Attack
Game in Tekken 3 well.  Please note that I may have been using some cuss words
and I do apologize if I had to use 'em.  The reason why is because in the world
of Tekken 3, FAQ stealing is dominant, and it's time that we burn FAQ lamers to
a crisp!

==============================================================================
VESTIROTH'S RECOMMENDATIONS

1.   Don't bother using the unblockables, there is no reason for you to use
     them.  Doing so will force the opponent to commit a heavy counterattack
     on you with virtually no escape.

2.   Don't overuse one move as your opponent may try to "spy on you" as you
     habitually do the move.  Afterwards, once your opponent finds out about
     the move that you habitually use, then be prepared for heavy attacks.

3.   Axe Kicks and the Tile Splitting Fandango should provide you with good
     frontal coverage.  Besides these moves, Heihachi has a back punch called
     the Pervert's Hand, which stuns your opponents and shoves them in
     counterhits.

4.   Heihachi has some of the easier juggling moves in the game.  Reading this
     guide, I'm assuming that you know how to do his juggling moves from Tekken
     2.  Experts can save a lot of time with a nice, ferocious juggle.  Don't
     overuse the juggles as your opponent has a bad habit of catching on.

5.   Use 10-Hit Combos only if your opponent pisses you off long enough.  I
     prefer doing the combos that start with a df+3 because with regards to
     the Big K's old 10-Hit from Tekken 1, it takes too much effort to pull
     off the first RP.

6.   You have a Wind Godfist much better than Jin's.  Try to pull off as many
     powerful attacks (remember to mix 'em up) and use juggles whenever you
     think it's comfortable to do them.
==============================================================================
JIN KAZAMA
Jin isn't as powerful as you are, but please be aware that he has his mother's
"Geese-esque" moves, which means that you must stay clear of him whenever you
attack.  Don't let Jin fool you with his White Heron moves and definitely watch
out for that darn cheese wheel.  He virtually has the same moves and techniques
just like you, but since your fighting is more original (I'm assuming that you
have played Tekken and Tekken 2 already), you should tell Jin how wrong you are
teaching him Mishima Karate by applying a few "Pervert's Hand" combos on him
and by just variating your moves once in a while.
Vestiroth's suggestion:  If Jin pisses you off, then try one of your 10-hitters
from Tekken 2, but use it well.  If you variate your moves (i.e. Twin Pistons),
then you don't have to worry about using a 10-hitter at all.  If Jin tries Kaz's
10-hitter from Tekken 1, then after the fourth hit blast him up.

NINA AND ANNA WILLIAMS
Nina and Anna can be a major pain in the ass because they have a bad habit of
variating their attacks.  This is because they both have a lot of moves on their
book.  Don't let them do their multiparts on you or this would be your last.
As with Jin extreme caution is recommended whenever you take on them because
their countermoves can tear up the area real fast.  I would go with Axe Kicks,
Tile Breaking Fandangos, Pervert's Hand Combos, and whatever hits mid or low to
protect my front.  Block all the hits to minimize the cha-chi Nina and Anna may
commit, and definitely watch out for the Blonde's Wrath (Their stomping move)
if you get knocked down.

PAUL PHOENIX
Paul may not be as tough as I may think because IMHO Heihachi's skills may be
too much for Phoenix to withstand.  The only things I'm telling you is to watch
out for the jumpkicks and the Tree Cutting Fandango moves.  Although you must
also exercise extreme caution when attacking Paul (because he has countermoves),
you can be a little more aggressive on him because his countermoves isn't as
unpleasant as Jin's, Nina's, or Anna's.  Just don't overuse one move too much
which may make Paul notarize you the instant you keep repeating.

HWOARANG
Here, use Heihachi like you would with Jin and Paul.  Throw Pervert's Hands,
Axe Kicks, and any juggling shots that would force Hwoarang to stay in the
defensive.  You have a better variety of moves that guards you defenisvely than
Hwoarang does.  The only thing I'm asking you of this is not to be fooled by
his lightning-fast kick combos that are nearly hard to counteract.

EDDY GORDO
Definitely go for mid and low attacks since Eddy loves to stay low for almost
all of the time.  His kicks do mega damage so KEEP UP YOUR GUARD!  Definitely
use a 10-hitter if Eddy pisses you off, and try to utilize your juggling moves
often since juggling may conserve your hit points.  I would just try juggling
with the WGF since Hei's hits mid rather than high as opposed to Jin.

LING XIAOYU
Xiaoyu is the fastest character in the game, and since she's small and since
she can crouch down at times to avoid all that darn high attacks, you should
plan on refraining from using any high attacks against her.  I would just slam
her with Tile Breaking Fandangos and Pervert's Hand Combos, since they all hit
mid and keep Ling on the defensive.  Watch out for some weird moves that Ling
can perform, since they cover Ling's front as well.  The key to defeating Ling
is to react as soon as Ling attacks.

LEI WULONG
Lei is one of the more powerful characters in the game as he can variate his
play dead, turn around, and his Wuxing stances for incredible variety.  Also
to be afraid of is his kicks, which do a good amount of damage.  There are
some moves that you have to watch out for (i.e. Chusaigatsuki), since Lei can
go either on a Turn Around or a Play Dead Stance if he prefers.  Although Lei
is not bright with his Play Dead, you still must use extreme caution when
okizeme'n him.  Don't let Lei fool you with his drunken attack.  Keep your
distance if he has to do this.  If you can stay aggressive most of the time,
then Lei shouldn't be fancy on you.

Dr. BOSCANOVITCH
If you are playing the game on the Dimensional Pad, then you will find this
match the hardest you'll ever play.  This is so because you'll need the power
of the Nakaruba Rai and the Geta Stomping since Boscanovitch may elect to
stay low for almost all of the time.  Before your next game, buy a joystick
so you can shave off time on this freak.

YOSHIMITSU
When Yoshimitsu begins to use a dizzy left kick, he's signaling you that he's
about to use a mid right kick so counter him the instant you see that spinning
left.  React too slow and you will say ouch.  Yoshimitsu needs some time to
activate his piercing screaming fist but be aware that Yo-Man may prefer to
use the Fan Cutter instead.  Be aware that when Yo-Man does the Poison Flip,
he's signaling that he will be doing a spiral backfist, into a backflip, and
into a screaming fist.  Try to force him into the defensive by mixing up your
attacks one by one and whenever he does a dizzy left kick, blast him before he
completes his zigzag.

FOREST LAW
Forest is the most ANNOYING opponent you'll ever fight.  The reason why this
is so is because you have to deal with his flip kicks pretty often.  Since
nearly all of his moves hit at the same location, there's no excuse why you
shouldn't block and counter.  After a failed flip kick combo, you can just
(for a laugh) do a 10-hitter from Tekken 2 or you can use anything which won't
sacrifice frontal coverage for major damage, but any mixing-up would be OK
and definitely attack Law based on your own preference.

KUMA AND PANDA
Kuma has the longest reach in the game.  It's important that you don't give
her a chance to deck you with any of her hits or that hit could be your last.
Don't let her throw you either.  Use Twin Pistons, Pervert's Hands, Axe Kicks,
and anything that hits mid, and since Kuma's oversized, try juggling her for
a laugh.

JULIA CHANG
Fight Julia like you would fight Michelle as Heihachi in Tekken 2.  Block all
of her hits and counter with any juggling moves or strong combos that you can
perform in a flash.  You may be slower than Julia, but your power and reach are
much greater.  Be aware that Julia can confuse you as well and don't give her
a chance to use any of her throws.

GUN JACK
Gun Jack is much stronger than Jack-2 or Prototype Jack.  I would fight Gun
Jack the same way as I would fight Kuma but be aware that Gun Jack has a better
variety than Kuma, though.  Since his hits are slow, you should have no problem
reacting but be aware of the clapper because that's when he may confuse you.
Also, watch out for moves that Gun Jack can use that vary to many degrees.  Even
though this is the case, I would fight Gun Jack like I would with Jack when I'm
Heihachi in Tekken 2, but I would attack more aggressively.

BRYAN FURY
Bryan doesn't have multiparts like Bruce, but his hits are fast and can be a pain
in the arse if you don't block them in time.  Steer clear of his sledgehammer and
any other moves that allows Bryan to variate in certain degrees.  IMHO any move
that covers Heihachi's front should be used.  Bryan may be resistant to juggles
so take the necessary precautions.

TOSHIN
Don't let Toshin use his infinity kicks or that hit could be your last.  Since
he has lots of moves from Tekken 2, you must be aware that Toshin can variate
hits up and down to confuse the hell out of you.  Also, the Snake Combination
must be steered clear of.  If Toshin tries his Whirlwind Fairy on you, block
both hits high, and then punish him (for a laugh) with either a 10-hit combo or
any move that you can perform in a flash that causes good damage.  If Toshin
uses his Shin Kick, you can block the first hit, duck the second hit, and then
(for a laugh) juggle or blast him if you want.  Since Toshin has a lot of
unblockables, prepare to take some damage.

SHIN TOSHIN
Fight Shin Toshin like you would with Toshin, but since Shin Toshin is huge,
his abilities are slightly hurt, but that doesn't stop him from using his
Inferno and Ogre Blaster moves on you.  Dodge these two moves like you would
with Oni No Kazuya in Tekken 2.  If you block all hits, move fast, and stay
persistent, then Shin Toshin shouldn't be too hard to beat.

KING THE SECOND
When King throws you, be aware that he can instantly kill you with his multi-
parts.  Watch out for his stagger kick because he may always trick you with
an uppercut.  Stay clear of the gut punch because if he happens to counter,
chances are that he may wish to throw you, which is not good.  Also, he has
a bad habit of using his backhand to lunge punch and his unblockable Leg Bomb.
His 10-hitters are otherwise noticeable by the expert player.  I would try to
stay aggressive on him since he's rather independent of variety.

MOKUJIN
Since Mokujin will randomly switch characters throughout the match, you must
change your strategies according to the stances Mokujin performs at the start
of the round.  Please read SurfBard's Tekken 3 FAQ for the description of the
stances.

GON
Gon isn't as problematic as Boscanovitch is but you still must block low or
high depending on the attacks Gon uses.  You can juggle if you want, but I
would just pulverize Gon with Pervert's Hands and with Tile-Breaking Fandango
moves.  I'm pretty sure that Heihachi has what it takes to send Gon to hell.

VS YOUR CLONE
Use Heihachi like if you are an expert Heihachi Player.  Block all of his moves
and counter heavy with any attack you can pull off quick.  Your variety is much
greater than you had during Tekken 2.  I would just use a little caution when
trying to use right kicks since Heihachi may use his energy-using counter if
by all means possible.  Don't get pissed if your clone dies because of the
counter.  As long as you are careful of his Rising Sun and his Hell Axle moves
then you shouldn't have too many problems.
