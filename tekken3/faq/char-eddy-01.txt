Eddy was born in one of the most wealthy families in Brazil. As a 
successor of his father's enterprise, Eddy was an excellent student 
in the study of monarchism; he was famous for his diligentness and 
the gentle characteristic in town. At the age of 19, one day after 
school, Eddy found his father dying in blood. His father told him 
that a syndicate had attempted to kill him. He had planned to 
eliminate drug syndicates which spoil the country. Getting enough
information to procecute the syndicate and being about to execute, 
he was attacked by them. His last word was "it's not the right time
to fight now. Take the guilt of homicide and hide yourself in the
prison." 


Fallen from an excellent student, he was imprisoned as a criminal.
The life in the prison was practically a living hell. He cried 
every day at his powerlessness which eventually turned into a 
grudge against the syndicate which killed his father. One day a 
riot arose in the prison,and Eddy saw an extraordinary incident. 
Fascinated by the power of an old man, Eddy went to the old man
and asked what was the art he used,Capoeiristas. Obtaining power
was his first priority, he thought. Then he was trained by the old 
man. 8 years had passed since his inprisonment. 


At the age of 27, Eddy's Capoeiristas had turned into the lethal 
weapon driven by his pledge to revenge on the syndicate. Released 
from the prison, he heard a rumor about "the King of Iron Fist 
Tournament" and noticed the existance of the Mishima Empire. 
Having an idea to use the great power of Mishima group and take 
revenge on the syndicate, Eddy decided to attend the tournament.


|First Things First|
A word of warning..playing Eddy will cause you to be disliked, 
hated and ridiculed and under the best circumstances you may be 
tolerated although you undoubtedly will recieve death threats 
from time to time.  Being tolerated is unacceptable, that's why 
a true Eddy player needs to learn ALL of his transitions for every
move; such as the standard Jingah position, Grounded position, 
and the Handstand position.  This will leave your opponent at odds 
with him/herself as to how to appropriately counter attack and 
could give you MANY sweet openings to rip him/her a new opening 
or two :)


General Abbreviated Translations-
If you are having difficulty understanding the abbreiviations 
then lord help you. Or just email me and i'll clear it up for you. 
Frankly I don't have the patience to write them out right now; 
sorry boyos :) Maybe in the next version...

A few tricks of the trade-


Doos...


(1) Dodge, dodge a lot, and vary your combos in an attempt 
    to confuse opponent.
(2) Did I mention Dodge?
(3) How about varying combos?
(4) Eddy has an extremely quick recovery time from MOST of his 
    moves,so don't be too careful while playing Eddy; keep in 
    mind that a complacent Eddy is a dead Eddy.
(5) Eddy has so many different variations moves which look 
    similar if not identical for a reason (so that people can 
    get pissed at you and yell "cheap I blocked that!"), stay 
    aware of your transitions and take the initiative by taking 
    advantage of them.
(6) Attack! Attack! Attack! but if you are put on the defensive 
    the b+rk combo starter has a LOT of great options and if you 
    see your opponent is stunned by the initial Arching crescent 
    continue with the rk, lk+rk combo for easy massive damage. 
    But if you want to stay on the safe side use Eddys d+rk/d+lk 
    and his standing left kick whenever you see your enemy 
    advancing, his standing left kick has great priority and the 
    damage is considerable making it a viable option. I've kicked 
    Paul out of many of his attacks using this handy simple move
    and it's magnificent versus Ninas, Laws and Hwoarangs. Besides
    these Eddys sidesteps have a great choice of defensive options,
    try practicing the skull kick combos to keep them on their 
    toes. Also when in a jam d/f lk is always a safe bet. Also 
    in case you miss a flip attack b+lk will save your coola more 
    often than not.
(7) Here is a DO that you should only do once you've got the hang 
    of Eddy.Once you see your opponent backing up immeidiately 
    attack with the Entering Heaven ss+4+3. You must cancel the 
    sidestep in the first maybe 5 or so frames in order for it 
    to connect. If this jumping kick connects then expect a HUGE 
    payoff and a few "cheaps" and "What the Hels" from your 
    competition. You see while backing up there is a HUGE lag 
    before one can defend again and it is much more prevelant 
    in Tekken 3 than in the second installment. If Entering Heaven 
    connects expect a payoff of at least 65%. You should be 
    connecting with their chin right after their initial leap 
    backwards. 


MORE TO COME...


donts....


(1) WHATEVER YOU DO do not half complete the Sattelite Moon Kick 
    combos,Eddy will have a LONG pause after the first kick unless 
    you follow up with either the sattelite ground kick or the 
    bazooka kick, this is not a good thing because this means you 
    are comitted to one or the other which spells a Mega Counter 
    opportunity for a seasoned player.
(2) Do NOT idle in the grounded position versus Paul, Nina, or King 
    unless you truly know what you're doing. In other words if you 
    decide to indulge the grounded position at anytime versus there 
    characters you better act fast or else be double palmed, trip 
    elbowed, or ali kicked to death.
(3) Do NOT abuse the flare sweeps, unless you mix them up with the 
    lp+rp headbutt. However if your opponent is looking for the 
    headbutt be wary because it is very easy to Mega Counter the 
    headbutt.
(4) Try to stay in the handstand as infrequently as possible and 
    practice dodging from the handstand when in a jam.
(5) If your opponent somehow makes their way behind you or to the 
    side of you while you are in the handstand position DO NOT 
    continue to attack while Eddy is in the handstand position 
    his moves DO NOT track.  Turn around and continue to piss 
    them off.
(6) Stay away from holding backwards while attacking for you may
    accidentally transition into an ill timed handstand position.
(7) Do not give your opponent a breather.Try your best to not 
    allow your opponent to get up and if they lally gag as is 
    expected from some Leis and Eddys do abuse them with 
    SS 4,3+4 (hold down) 4~3. This takes timing but it will 
    definately take an intimidating chunk out of their energy 
    not to mention set you up to bambuzzle them with another 
    string. Since the 4~3 leaves you in the handstand position; 
    your opponent will find it difficult to counter your strings 
    or guess them at such a close proximity while they are 
    standing up.
