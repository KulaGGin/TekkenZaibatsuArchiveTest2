PROLOGUE
--------
King is one of the hardest, maybe even THE hardest, character to learn in 
Tekken 3. His multis takes a lot of memorization. More importantly, King do 
not have a lot of special technique like other characters. However, as I 
have discovered, King has the ability to be a lethal characters. In this 
guide, I will try to explain, to the best of my ability, some strategies on 
how to play King. So, sit back, and enjoy!

I. Overview of King
-------------------
King is a wrestler, which means that most of his damaging attacks are in the 
form of throws. Many people tried to play King by depending on his multi 
parts and throws. This, as I and maybe many other King players have found, 
is not the most effective way of playing King. All Tekken masters knows the 
escape sequences of King's throws and multis. Most people forget about his 
special techniques, which is very useful. Mixing his special techniques, 
throws, and multiparts can result in a very dangerous King. Learning to mix 
it up can take a long time, but the end result is devastating.

============================================================================
============================================================================

II. Ratings on King
-------------------
advantages: multis, more multis, good pokes, some sneaky attacks
disadvantages: multis, lack of precanned combos, hard to master
* the preceding was based on my experience

easy opponent: Kuma, Gun Jack, Hwoarang, Law, Yoshi, Eddy, Ogre II
medium opponent: Lei, Heihachi, Julia, Ogre I, Bryan, Mokujin, King, Ling
hard opponent: Paul, Jin, Nina
* the opponent ratings are based on my experiences against CPU and human 
player. Any character can be dangerous in the hand of an expert/master. 
Sometimes, the CPU is just a b****.

III. Moves/Special Technique Discussion
---------------------------------------

**** general moves ****

     I don't know why I forgot to put this in the earlier versions of my 
guide, but here it is! By the way, this section is tailored to what King
can do (some may appear in the rest of this document)

f/F                           - walk forward (slowly)
b/B                           - walk backward (slowly)
ub/u/uf                       - low jump
UB/U/UF                       - high jump
d                             - feint duck
D                             - duck completely
DF                            - crouch forward
DB                            - crouch back
f,f                           - dash forward
b,b                           - dash back
u~n                           - sidestep to background
d~n                           - sidestep to foreground
f,f,f                         - run
|-> 1+2                         - running cross chop

f,n,d,df                      - crouch dash (ends up crouching)
u+2/uf+2                      - quick pounce (on floored opponent)
U+2/UF+2                      - hard pounce (on floored opponent)
1+2+3+4                       - power charge (cannot block when charged)

**** multiparts strategies ****

     I decided to discuss strategies on multiparts first, because they could 
be either King's strength OR his weakness. Multiparts are the most awesome 
and damaging attacks in the game. However it has a couple of weaknesses:

1. They can be interrupted - a lot of good players knows the escape 
sequences of King's multis. They also knows how to break the multis starter.

2. Long recovery time - when you initiate the multi's starter and missed, 
there's quite a long pause before you gain control, long enough for a move 
to be executed, whether it is a juggle starter, a throw, or other stuff.

These two reasons is why I personally think that King's multis are not very 
effective. However, there is a way to use multiparts so that it will help 
you out.
     King's multis are divided into 2 class, the dash-multis and side-step 
multis. Dash-multis are those multi starters that requires King to dash 
first before grabbing the opponent. These are the most rewarding multis, 
and also the most difficult to set up. The dashing starter are the df+1+2 
starter, the f,n,d,df starters and the b,f,df starters. These will go under 
high attacks. So if you know that a series of high attacks are coming, then 
that is the best time to use this. You can also use this when you know that 
your opponent makes a huge mistake, like doing a move with a long recovery 
time. However, those strategies is hard to do, since good players don't 
really make a lot of mistakes.
     The sidestep starters are the most useful multi starter. It is very 
useful used as a suprise move, because of the side step factor. If you know 
that your opponent will do a string of moves that won't track, use the side
step multis to get out of the way and set them up. Be careful, however, 
since there are some moves that will track you. You can also set up opponent 
when they used moves with long recovery time. Another trait about this 
starter is that it could be delayed, meaning you can do the sidestep first 
and press the buttons at the last minute, making it more unpredictable. Last 
but not least, you can also "psych" your opponent. What I mean is that you 
use the side step multis when your opponent is about to launch an attack. If 
they do, they will miss and King will set them up. This is really hard to do 
because it requires good instincts. You can also cancel this multi starter 
by holding B during the motion of the multi. Try cancelling in randomly so 
the opponents will be more confused.  The bad side of this starter is that 
it is the most dangerous starter, because it has a horrible recovery time, 
and it is also the most visible. Be careful when you use it.
     Once you've started a multi, there is a chance that the opponent will 
break away. There is nothing you can do about that. However, I've noticed a 
few things that could help you out. When you initiated a multi, there is 
about a 2-3 second of time when King is doing the current throw. You can 
enter the next sequence 2-3 times in this time. I've noticed that when you 
entered the sequence this many time, it is HARDER for the opponent to break 
away. I'm not sure what the cause is, though.
     A lot of people are asking about the timing of the multis; when to 
press the sequence. The fact is that it's not the timing that is important, 
it's the tempo and the button pressed that are important. What I mean by 
tempo is that you press the sequence rythmically. There have to be the SAME 
interval between the parts of the sequence. For example, the cannonball 
link sequence is: 2,2,1+2. To do it correctly, the amount of time between 
the first 2, the second 2, and the 1+2 must be equal. What I mean by the 
'button pressed' is that you have to press the correct sequence. I know this 
is basic, but sometimes this is the problem. The RDC ender's sequence is 
1+3,3+4,2+4,1+2, 1+2+3. You can easily press the wrong sequence here. In 
conclusion, having a good tempo and pressing the right sequence is the key 
to do these links.
     Remember that you are taking a big risk in starting a multiparts. But 
it is very rewarding. Multiparts are King's strongest assets. Using King 
without using any multis every now and then is like fighting guns with bare 
hands. Thus, learning how to use multiparts correctly is essential in 
achieving the status as King masters.

**** Regular Throw Discussion ****

     King has quite a lot of regular throws. Most of them can be breaked 
just by using either the left or right punch buttons. But some have more 
complex escape sequences. Therefore, you should alternate which throw you 
want to execute. Keep your opponent guessing.
     From what I've experienced, regular throws are most useful when used 
when an opponent uses an attack with long recovery time and miss. There are 
a lot of move out there that have a long recovery time. An example would be 
Nina's blonde bomb( f,f+1+2 ), King's turnaround kick( b+4 ), Law's flip 
kicks( 3+4,3 ), etc. You can also throw when you know the opponent is going 
to miss. For example, Lei's rave war( db+4,4 ) second hit is high, so you 
can duck it and throw after. The same goes for Hwoarang's 1,1,3,3 combo's 
last hit. You can also do a throw when you stun someone. For example, when 
you do the stomach smash and get the counter hit, or the 9th hit of King's 
10-string that ended in the powerbomb. You can throw them in those 
situations, but the timing is very strict.
     The same stuff above can also be said about side/back throws. The only 
difference is the location where King catch the opponent. There are several 
moves that leaves opponent on their back. Law's elbow -> reverse flipkick 
combination is such a move. For Yoshi's copter and Gun Jack's thrust, you 
have to run up behind them first, and throw them. The same can be said for 
Julia's earthquake stomp, but the timing is harder. Back throws cannot be 
escaped, and it cost tons of damage. However, they are very hard to pull 
off.
     Crouch throws is quite a useful move. It is fairly quick to pull off, 
and it has less recovery time than ground throws. It requires the opponent 
to be in a crouching position. A few low attacks should get them crouching. 
You can also start a multiparts when the opponent is crouching, although 
the sequence is complex( df,df+2+4 OR df,df+1+3 ). 
     Ground throws is very tricky to pull off. If you missed, the recovery 
time is quite long, and that leaves you very vulnerable. Most people 
usually gets off the ground before you can attempt a ground throw anyway, 
unless they are really dumb:). There are a few moves for King that leaves 
the opponent in the position where they are vulnerable to ground throws. 
King's left kick reversal is one of them. It'll leave you standing on 
opponent's side, face up. The jaguar driver leaves the opponent face up feet 
first. King's standing heel hold to STF multiparts leaves the opponent on 
their side. King's mid uppercut usually puts the opponent on the ground, 
although you have to run up to them a little bit. King's 10-string that ends 
up in a powerbomb is a good ground throw set-up moves, and the same goes for 
his ankle smash( D,df+1 ).
     Like multiparts, regular throws are not very effective when it is used 
regularly. I advise to keep them as a suprise move. Some of King's complex 
throws cost about half of opponent's life. The giant swing cost about 70 
points of damage. King is the game's master of throws, so keep them in mind 
for some in-close fighting. 

=========================================================================

**** List of Regular Throws ****

     The regular throws are listed first, then crouching throws, then ground 
throws. Here it is:

** Front Throws **

Name: Swing DDT
Sequence: 1+3
Damage: 35
Escape: 1
Notes:
This throw and the Suplex are King's basic throw. They are useful because 
they are the easiest to perform. Some may say that these throws are easily 
breaked, but by just mixing them up, the chances of being breaked are 
greatly reduced.

Name: Suplex
Sequence: 2+4
Damage: 35
Escape: 2
Notes:
See notes on Winding Nut.

Name: Knee Bash
Sequence: df+2+3
Damage: 30
Escape: 2
Notes:
Not as easy as the basic throws, but easier to execute than the other throws.

Name: Frankensteiner
Sequence: df+3+4
Damage: 45 (60 on counter hit)
Escape: none
Notes:
This will connect if you hit the opponent with the frankensteiner as a 
counter hit, or if you are close enough. Useful because there is no escape 
for this throw. However, it takes a while to perform, so they could jab you 
while you are in the air. Use this when the opponent is getting up to 
enhance your chance to perform this throw.

Name: T-Bone Powerbomb
Sequence: d,db,b+1+2
Damage: 50
Escape: 1+2
Notes:
The coolest looking throw in the game! It is also easy to pull off, and the 
escape is trickier. You could end up doing the Irish Whip instead of this 
throw, so practice a lot.

Name: Pile Driver
Sequence: d,df,f+1
Damage: 15
Escape: 3+4
Notes:
This throw is quite useful because the escape is quite unique, and it can be 
linked to the Boston Crab. The sequence is a little complicated, but with a 
little practice, you can do it.

Name: Face Smash
Sequence: d,df,f+1~1+2
Damage: 30
Escape: 3+4
Notes:
This is a transformed Jaguar Driver. The escape is still the same. Press 1+2 
quickly after the Jaguar Driver connects right away to get this throw.

Name: Figure 4 Leg Lock
Sequence: db+1+2
Damage: 32
Escape: 1+2 (reversal: 3+4)
Notes:
This throw is quite dangerous because the opponent is able to reverse it for 
26 pts. damage to you. However, in the heat of the battle, opponents are 
less likely to reverse it.

Name: Giant Swing
Sequence: f,b,db,d,df,F+1
Damage: 70
Escape: 1
Notes:
Although this move is hard to pull off, the damage is so big. Sometimes I 
ended up pulling this throw when I meant to do the Jaguar Driver. Practice 
the sequence, then you will be alright.

Name: Tombstone Pile Driver
Sequence: db,F+2
Damage: 58
Escape: 2
Notes:
Kinda hard to pull off, since the joystick sequence is kinda tricky. However, 
with a little practice, this throw can be a valuable asset, since it is one 
of the throws that do not require a lot of stick movement. Good damage, too.

Name: DDT
Sequence: D,db,d,DB+1+2
Damage: 55
Escape: 1+2
Notes:
This is an almost useless throw. The only time I can possibly think of when 
you can pull this throw off is when a series of high attacks are coming, or 
the opponent are just dumb. The damage is not phenomenal( about 56-58 pts ). 
Give yourself a pat in the back when you are able to do this throw.

** Side Throws **

Name: Argentine Back Breaker ( left side throw )
Sequence: 1+3  OR  2+4
Damage: 40
Escape: 1
Notes:
Side throws are just like regular throws. The different is where you caught 
the opponents.

Name: Knee Drop ( right side throw )
Sequence: 1+3  OR  2+4
Damage: 42
Escape: 2
Notes:
See notes for Argentine Back Breaker

** Back Throws **

Name: Half Boston Crab
Sequence: 1+3
Damage: 60
Escape: none
Notes:
If your opponent ever show his back, and you are close enough, punish them 
with back throws. King's back throws are some of the strongest throws in 
the game, and you can't escape from back throws.

Name: Cobra Twist
Sequence: 2+4
Damage: 60
Escape: none
Notes:
Same thing with the Half Boston Crab

Name: Octopus Slam
Sequence: b,F+1+2
Damage: 75
Escape: none
Notes:
a little harder to pull off, but nastier damage.

** Crouching Throw **

Name: Jumping Power Bomb
Sequence: d+1+3  OR  d+2+4
Damage: 45
Escape: 1+2 (for both)
Notes:
King has the ability to throw crouching people. Use it when you are close 
enough and the opponent is crouching. This will make the opponent think 
twice when crouching. You can also use this after you low cancel the low 
kick attacks of your opponents. Tap f really fast, and do the sequence. 
Timing is rather hard, though.

** Ground Throws **

Name: Crotch Head Butt
Sequence: db+2+4
Damage: 33
Escape: 3+4
Notes:
opponents must be in face up, feet toward position (facing up, feet toward 
you). Looks painful in real life.

Name: Figure 4 Leg Lock
Sequence: DB+2+4
Damage: 33
Escape: 3+4
Notes:
opponents must be in face up, feet toward position. You must hold the DB 
position to do this throw.

Name: Mini Swing
Sequence: db+1+3
Damage: 30
Escape: 3+4
Notes:
opponent must be in face up, feet toward position. 

Name: Flip Over
Sequence: db+1+3  OR  db+2+4
Damage: none
Escape: 1+3 or 2+4, respectively
Notes:
opponents must be in face up, side toward position( facing up, left/right 
side toward you ). Cost no damage.

Name: Arm Crucifixion
Sequence: db+1+3  OR  db+2+4
Damage: 28
Escape: 1+2
Notes:
opponents must be in face up, feet away position(facing up, feet away from 
you).

Name: Wing Tearer
Sequence: db+1+3  OR  db+2+4
Damage: 32
Escape: 1+2
Notes:
opponent must be in face down, feet away position.

Name: Half Boston Crab
Sequence: db+1+3  OR  db+2+4
Damage: 30
Escape: 3+4
Notes:
opponent must be in face down, feet toward position.

Name: Camel Clutch
Sequence: db+1+3  OR  db+2+4
Damage: 37
Escape: 2+4
Notes:
opponent must be facing down, and have his right side toward you

Name: Strangle
Sequence: db+1+3  OR  db+2+4
Damage: 35
Escape: 1+3
Notes:
opponent must be facing down, and have his left side toward you

=========================================================================

**** Special Technique Discussion ****

     King has a rather small amount of special moves, but the way I see
it, the ones he has are very useful, almost each and everyone of them.

	In this section, I will discuss each of King's special technique in 
detail. This is the form I will use:

Name: whatever
Sequence: how to do this move
Attack Level: high/medium/low/ground
              (two or more level could be given)
Damage: in points
Usefulness: on the scale of 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest)
Abilities: anything special
Notes: a little description

Now that I have given you all of that stuff, here we go:

****
Name: stagger kick
Sequence: d+3+4,4,4(,4,4) OR (WC),df+4,4,4(,4,4)
Attack Level: low/ground
damage: 13 (first hit only)
Usefulness: 7 1/2
Abilities: stun( read notes ), hit grounded opponents
Notes:
Stagger kick is King's trademark moves. It has 2 attack level. IF the 
first 2 connects, it will stun the opponent. It can be started from a 
standing or crouching position. It can also be followed with a spinning 
uppercut, by pressing 2 after d+3+4. On counter hit, it is possible to do 
it 5 times, and the smash can be done after the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd kick. 
However, stagger kick has a long recovery time. If an opponent was able 
to block the last of the 3 ali kicks, he could be crouch grabbed. Overall, 
a good attack.

****
Name: hop kick
Sequence: uf+4
Attack Level: mid
Damage: ?
Usefulness: 9
Abilities: juggles
Notes:
This is not really a special move, but in King's case, it is. It actually 
hit medium, not high. It's King's best juggle starter. It leaves you open 
for a split second, but usually not long enough for an opponent to attack 
you. It can be reversed, though. I feel that this move is best use as a 
suprise move. Overall, a very good attack.

****
Name: konvict kick
Sequence: f,f+4
Attack Level: mid
Damage: 30
Usefulness: 8
Abilities: -
Notes:
I prefer this move rather than the turn around kick, because it will not 
leave you turned around. This move is not good used as a close attacks, due 
to the sequence. It is an excellent medium range attack, however. It has 
good damage, and it's quick. Overall, a good attack.

****
Name: mid savate kick
Sequence: df+3
Attack Level: mid
Damage: ?
Usefulness: 9
Abilities: - 
Notes:
This move has suprising range, long enough to caught some people offguard. 
A good move to pull out of nowhere, because most people don't see this move 
a lot. It is one of King's longest and easiest to pull kick move. Great 
from mid to close range. Overall, a great move.

****
Name: low savate kick
Sequence: df+4
Attack Level: mid/ground
Damage: ?
Usefulness: 9
Abilities: - 
Notes:
Another version of the savate kick. Though it lacks range, it does not lack 
in usefulness. In the heat of the battle, almost no one expect this sneaky 
move. It also hit grounded opponents, and it is a good counter move. 
Overall, a great move.

****
Name: turnaround kick
Sequence: b+4
Attack Level: high
Damage: 20 
Usefulness: 7
Abilities: result in a back turned position
Notes:
I have mixed feelings about this attack. It can be reversed, or ducked. It 
also have a long recovery time. It also leaves you in a back turned 
position, and you can't block in this position. However, this is a good 
counter move, because it is easy to pull. Overall, a fair attack, although 
be cautious when using it.

****
Name: moonsault body press
Sequence: 1+4 OR <back turned position>+1+4
Attack Level: all
Damage: 25
Usefulness: 7
Abilities: UNBLOCKABLES!!
Notes:
I consider this a special move because it's fairly quick to do. This move 
will hit a standing opponent and grounded opponent. It can also be done 
from the back turned position. However, it will leave you laying on the 
ground, face down, open to any ground traps/okizeme attacks. This move is 
also vulnerable against jabs, because you can jab King out of it while he's 
on the air. Overall, a good attack.

****
Name: clothesline
Sequence: <back turned position>+1+2
Attack Level: High
Damage: 50
Usefulness: 3
Abilities: UNBLOCKABLES!!
Notes:
Another alternative move from the back turned position. However, I don't 
recommend this move at all. It is easily seen, and can be ducked. The 
upside is that this move is very strong. Takes about 50% of health. 
Overall, this move is not effective.

****
Name: deadly boomerang kick
Sequence: SS+3+4
Attack Level: High
Damage: 60
Usefulness: 4
Abilities: - 
Notes:
This move cost about 60-70% on regular hit and around 80-90% on counter 
hit, and if you miss, you can roll away. However, that's the only good 
thing about it. This move has a low priority, meaning you can jab King away 
when he's doing it. It also hits high, which mean the move can be ducked. 
Overall, only use this move as a suprise, and not for anything else.

****
Name: frankensteiner
Sequence: df+3+4
Attack Level: all + ground
Damage: 15?
Usefulness: 8
Abilities: on counterhit, it will throw opponents
Notes:
Quite a useful move, although it takes a while to do. It will also hit 
grounded opponent. It will result in a throw if this move connects close 
enough, or on counterhit. Can be used in ground traps. Overall, a good 
move.

****
Name: drop kick
Sequence: f,f+3+4 OR 3+4 (delayed)
Attack Level: mid
Damage: 25
Usefulness: 7
Abilities: stun if blocked
Notes:
Not a very good move close up, due to the time it takes to perform it. But 
from medium range and up, it's pretty useful. This is a safe move to do, 
because it will stun your opponent. The delayed version takes longer to do, 
but you can use this to your advantage. Use the delayed version from a 
medium range to fool the opponent into attacking, and if he misses, King 
will knock him senseless. Overall, an average but safe move.

****
Name: satellite drop kick
Sequence: f,f,F+3+4 OR <run>+3+4
Attack Level: high
Damage: a lot...
Usefulness: 7
Abilities: stun if blocked
Notes:
Only good from long range. This version of the drop kick can be ducked, 
making it less useful. However, it takes off horrendous damage. Overall, a 
cautious move.

****
Name: standing left upper
Sequence: WS+1
Attack Level: high
Damage: ?
Usefulness: 8
Abilities: -
Notes:
This is a good counter move. It's pretty simple to do, and the recovery 
time is minimal. It's a close range move, though. Since King's poking 
technique ( which will be discussed later ) requires him to spend most of 
his time in a ducking position, this move is a great poking move. Overall, 
a great move.

****
Name: ankle smash
Sequence: D,DF+1  OR  DF~1
Attack Level: low/ground
Damage: 21
Usefulness: 8
Abilities: hit grounded opponent
Notes:
This move seems to always hit other opponent, maybe because no one uses this 
move regularly. This move is also a great ground trap move, because it will 
hit grounded opponent. As with all the move, do not use this move regularly, 
so your opponent will not get used to it. When you do this move, you can hold 
DF and press 1 two more times for 2 more ankle smash. Overall, a good move.

****
Name: elbow sting
Sequence: df+1
Attack Level: mid
Damage: ?
Usefulness: 9
Abilities: stun if blocked
Notes:
This is a nasty counterhit move, because it takes good damage, and it puts 
people on the ground on counterhit. If blocked, it will stun your opponent. 
It is also a very quick move. It has a medium recovery time. Overall, a 
great move.

****
Name: side swipe
Sequence: df+2
Attack Level: mid
Damage: ?
Usefulness: 8
Abilities: - 
Notes:
Though lacking in range, this move makes it up in speed and recovery time. 
The speed makes it a good counter move, and it's recovery time is good. The 
short range it has is the only drawback of this move. Overall, a good 
poking move.

****
Name: K's flicker/Grand Smash
Sequence: f,f+2  OR  D,DF+2  OR  WS+2
Attack Level: mid
Damage: 20
Usefulness: 6
Abilities: juggles on counter hit
Notes:
The cons of this move is that it has a quite long recovery time, enough for 
the opponent to be able to inflict something on you. On the other hand, 
this move does good damage, and it will juggle on counter hit. Overall, 
use this move carefully.

****
Name: stomach smash
Sequence: f,f,n,2
Attack Level: low
Damage: 6
Usefulness: 7
Abilities: stuns on counter hit / can link to a throw
Notes:
This is one of King's best medium to far range move. The neutral position 
in the sequence makes this move pretty much useless in close range fighting. 
If this move is a counter hit, press 1+2 to get the hi-jack backbreaker. 
You can also do a powerbomb, but the sequence( 1+2,u,d,n+3+4 ) is pretty 
complicated. You can also throw or juggle when you stun the opponent. Most 
importantly, this move hit low. Not many people know how to defend this 
move. Overall, don't use this move when you are too close to the opponent.

****
Name: dark arrow
Sequence: SS+2
Attack Level: mid
Damage: 30
Usefulness: 3
Abilities: stuns on counter hit
Notes:
This move should be taken out in Tekken 4. The 1/2 sec it took to complete 
this move is more than enough time for a good opponent to back away, or to 
inflict damage on you. Some less than average (way less!) opponent might 
fall into this move, but most people knows how to defend against this move. 
It does good damage, and it stuns on counterhit, but the bad points 
outweight the good points. Overall, use this move once every 3 months.


****
Name: jaguar lariat
Sequence: F+1+2
Attack Level: high
Damage: 50
Usefulness: 4
Abilities: UNBLOCKABLES!!
Notes:
King's unblockables are fairly quick. This one is one of the quickest 
unblockable moves in the game. However, it hits high, so it can be ducked, 
leaving you open. Overall, watch out when you do this move.

****
Name: flying cross chop
Sequence: f,f+1+2
Attack Level: high -> mid -> low -> ground
Damage: 15
Usefulness: 7
Abilities: stun if blocked
Notes:
This is a unique move. It hits in 4 different places. It goes from high, to 
mid, to low and ends up in a ground hit. It also stuns if blocked, and the 
stun is long enough so King can tack on 1 or 2 extra hits. Overall, a good 
move.

****
Name: jumping knuckle bomb
Sequence: uf+1+2
Attack Level: mid
Damage: 35
Usefulness: 6
Abilities: -
Notes:
This move has a long recovey time, and it doesn't stun. Remember this when 
you want to do this move. It is a good move for ground traps, though 
advanced player knows how to roll out of it. Overall, a cautious move.

****
Name: spinning elbow -> hand knife
Sequence: 1+2,1
Attack Level: mid -> mid
Damage: 15,21
Usefulness: 8
Abilities: result in back turned position( if only 1+2 is pressed )
Notes:
I consider this to only be 1 move. The second part will push the opponent 
out of range, so it is quite a safe move. If the 1st part hit, the 2nd part
will always hit. Pressing only 1+2 will result in the 1st part only, and you
end up in a back-turned position. I recommend doing both part of the move.
Overall, a good move.

****
Name: elbow drop
Sequence: d+1+2
Attack Level: mid / ground
Damage: 15
Usefulness: 5
Abilities: stuns
Notes:
Good ground traps move. This move is fairly quicker than the Tekken 2's 
version, and it does good damage. It also stuns. However, this move leaves 
King on the ground, vulnerable to sweeps and all sorts of ground traps. 
Overall, use this move cautiously.

****
Name: dashing knuckle bomb
Sequence: f,n,d,df,n,1+2
Attack Level: mid
Damage: 28
Usefulness: 7
Abilities: bounce juggle on counterhit
Notes: 
Since it is difficult to pull, this move is no good at close range. Use it 
when you are in a medium/far range. It has some recovery time, though, and 
I don't think it stuns when blocked. Don't forget to juggle if it is a 
counter. Overall, don't overuse.

****
Name: offensive push
Sequence: f,f,n,1+2 ( close up )
Attack Level: mid
Damage: none
Usefulness: 6
Abilities: stuns opponent
Notes:
This move doesn't take any opponent's life. It acts just like Jin's version. 
Remember that this move only happens if the opponent are close up. Overall, 
I haven't found a good way to use this move, but I'm sure there is.

****
Name: black shoulder
Sequence: f+2+3
Attack Level: mid
Damage: 40
Usefulness: 4
Abilities: - 
Notes: 
Though this move will do tremendous damage, it has quite a long recovery 
time and set up time. Most good player knows how to defend against this 
move. However, this is a good ground trap move, because it will hit a 
rising opponent and put them back on the ground again. Overall, only use 
for ground traps.

****
Name: jumping elbow drop
Sequence: uf+2+4
Attack Level: mid/ground
Damage: 35
Usefulness: 4
Abilities: - 
Notes:
This move is very visible, so the opponent might have time to react against 
it. It does good damage, and have ground traps capabilities. However, the 
bad points outweights the good points. Overall, use it very, very 
cautiously.

****
Name: kick reversals
Sequence: b+1+3  OR  b+2+4
Attack Level: will reverse high/medium kick
Damage: varies.... i think
Usefulness: 10
Abilities: left kick reversal will leave opponent open for ground throw
Notes:
You should master this move as fast as possible. In other words, learn other 
characters 10-strings' breakpoints. Namco's official Tekken 3 website has 
those information. King's reversals is easy to do, and it will save you 
from defeat many times. Best of all, King's reversal CANNOT BE REVERSED!!!. 
So feel free to reverse! HOWEVER, King's reversals will NOT reverse any 
punches. Overall, use this move whenever possible!!

***
Name: low thrust block
Sequence: db+1+4  OR  db+2+3  OR  d+1+4  OR  d+2+3
Attack Level: will reverse low punch/kick attacks
Damage: none
Usefulness: 10
Abilities: advantage by 26 frames 
Notes:
Though the sequence is kinda confusing, this important move needs to be 
mastered ASAP. You need to know which hit of the character 10-strings are 
low hit and also a break point. It will also reverse low punches. You can 
try to pull a crouch throw after you low cancel a low kick attacks. Tap f 
and do the crouch throw sequence quickly. Overall, also use this move 
whenever possible.

***
Name: attack reversal reversal/chickens (ARR)
Sequence: F+1+3 (for left limbs attacks)  OR  F+2+4 (for right limb attacks)
Attack Level: n/a
Damage: ?
Usefulness: 10
Abilities: reverse a reversal
Notes:
This is another thing that you have to master as soon as possible. Unfortunately,
this is probably the hardest thing to master in Tekken 3. To use this, you
must know if your opponent will use a reversal on your moves, which takes
a good amount of skills and a bigger amount of luck. If you can master the
timing involved, you can prolly master anything :o). To ARR a left limbs 
reversal, press F+1+3 within 8-10 frames after being reversed. Use F+2+4
on right limbs. To make it easier to ARR, buffer the F during the moves that
you think can be reversed, and press the appropriate buttons as soon as you
know you are being reversed. Overall, hard as f***, but worth it.

IV. Strategies Discussion
-------------------------

First of all, thanks to 1TruKing for sharing with me some strategies on 
King. All of the strategies here are supplied by me and him. Now, on to 
some strategies...

=========================================================================

**** General Strategies ****
     
     When you play King, you need the frame of mind that you are the best 
and nobody can stop you. Have no fear or show no fear. This is very 
important when you play. Be careful not to overuse King's linkers, because 
it can be broken with little effort, though it can be devastating when it 
connect. Most people expect you to throw and link, but don't. King's 
regular moves are very strong. Remember this: people think King is big, 
strong and slow. In general they are right, but he is a lot faster than you 
might think. King has the ability to be fast, by using poking technique 
and fast moves.  

- defense strategy -

	Personally, I like to play a defensive King. Since King's combo 
potential is rather small, you must master his defensive sides in order to
be good with him. Playing a defensive King imho consist of interrupting 
opponents with counter moves and a lot of dodging with side steps.
	Since King is much more effective at close range, mastering close range 
defense is highly imperative. I define close range from up next to each other
to the range where d+1 will connect. At close range, using lighting fast moves 
to counter is much more effective than waiting for a kick attack. Also,if you 
have lighting fast reflexes, you can also utilize close range side stepping 
(just ss without the 2+4) to avoid attacking opponents and either throw, juggle 
or use a special move on them. In this range, opponents can easily throw you, 
so blocking in this range is rather dangerous. If the opponent is a throw-happy
dude, duck his throws and use the ws+ moves. If the opponents happens to use 
King, rely more on counters. However, do not count out blocking. If the opponent
choose to use combos in close range, then blocking is probably the best thing
to use. Use kick attack reversal if the combo happens to use high/mid kick, and 
use low thrust block if there's any low attack in it. Here is a list of King's 
moves that have a good defensive potential in close range fighting (imho):

d+1~n+2 - great against those aggresive suckers. Basically a low jab with 
          an uppercut follow up. Works (almost) exactly like D+1
df+2 - works great from the far edge of close range because it comes out
       fast, but will not work if opponent is in a middle of a combo :o(
1,2 - works great as a suprise move. Try following it up with D+4 to 
      frustrate opponents
2,1 - same as 1,2, except it hits high -> mid
D+1 - great defensive stopper. Use this if you want to follow it up with
      either one of the ws+ moves. Otherwise, use d+1~n+2. This move will
      also track opponents who are not aligned with you
D+4 - same as D+1 except this hits low. D+1 hits special-mid
ws+2 - the juggler of the ws+ moves. It has a little recovery time. If 
       opponent block, quickly use D+1 to avoid any retaliation
ws+4 - quick, high priority mid kick. Longer reach than ws+1
ws+1 - quicker, high priority mid uppercut. Shorter reach than ws+4
uf+4 - quick hop kick that juggle. Use only if you are sure that it will 
       hit, or you'll be sorry

I have to warn you that some of the moves listed above can be reversed (such 
as df+2 or the punches) by an alert opponent. Use ARR (listed in the special 
technique section above) if they reverse it. One last thing, be smart about 
using the counter moves. For example, if the opponent is in the middle of an 
attack animation, the best advice I can give is to block it, because most of
the time their attack will connect before your counter move connect, and you
end up on the losing end of the stick. Choosing what is the right thing to do
can only be learned by experience.
	Beyond the close range is the medium range. I define medium range from
where the last range ended to the range where f,f+4 will connect. In this 
range, attack reversals and and low thrust blocks is easier to execute because 
it is easier to see which attacks are coming. Also at this range, side stepping 
also becomes easier, and you can use ss+2+4 more safely. This is important, 
because King has a lot of good options from the sidestep. However, a big part 
of defense in this range will involve blocking, especially against high/mid 
punch attacks, since King can't reverse those, and you are too far to use the 
fast counter moves to stop it. Mixing blocking, kick attack reversal, low 
thrust block, and side stepping in this range will provide a superior defense. 
You can also use some of King's special technique in this range as a counter 
move. Here is a list of King's moves that have good defensive potential in 
this range (imho, of course...):

f,f,n+2 - great, quick move that hits low. If it hits, it will push the 
          opponent away a little, making it quite safe. However, this move can
          only be effective from the far edge of this range, because of the
          built in dash. Read the "stun moves" section below to find out what 
          to do if this move hits as a counter hit. 
b+4 - kinda slow, but will set opponent up for okizeme if it hits as a
      counter hit. More effective as retaliatory move, though
df+3 - quick mid kick. Great against aggresive opponents
df+4 - low kick. Use as a suprise move to get the full effect.
df+1 - quick mid elbow (reversible, though...). Stagger if blocked. Grounds
       opponent at counterhit. Read the "stun moves" setion below to find out
       what to do if this move hits as a counter hit.
uf+4 - much more useful in this range. If they block it, quickly do D+1 to
       avoid retaliation
ss+* - in this range, you can sidestep easier, because you can see which side
       the attacks are coming from, and sidestep accordingly. There are a few
       things King can do froma sidestep. The obvious one is the ss+2+4 multi
       starter. This move will slide King to nearly behind the opponent. Another
       thing you can do is to interrupt the sidestep with one of King's move,
       such as ss,1+2,1 or ss,uf+4, etc. If the opponent is in the outer edge of
       this range, bust out ss+3+4 for 60+ pts of damage. Lastly, if your 
       opponent is rather aggresive, bust out ss+2, which is a stun move.

At this range, blocking will probably be the defensive method you will be 
using most of the time. However, don't just abandon these counter moves and
stick only to blocking. You can use these moves to turn the table on an
aggresive opponent and force them to play defense. As always, be careful in
choosing the technique you want to use.
	Beyond the medium range is the far range. I define far range from the end
of the last range to the maximum distance allowed between characters. In this
range, the best defensive method is to make the opponent whiff their attack by
either side stepping a lot or back dashing. If they whiff, go for a retaliatory
attack in the form of either one of King's moves or a multiparts. There's not
a lot of counter move that can be done in this range. Here's a few that I can
think of:

f,f+3+4 - the unreversible drop kick. Staggers opponent if blocked. It hits
          medium too
f,f,n+2 - the stomach smash. It's actually a lot safer to do this move in this
          range. Just becareful not to whiff it.
ss+3+4 - the boomerang kick. It's also a lot safer to do this move in this
         range, because you should have enough to roll away and avoid some
         okizeme attacks.
f,f+4 - the jail kick. If an opponent is charging in, do this move and they 
        will eat your foot. Also becareful not to whiff this move.

	Lastly, you need to familiarize yourself with the attack levels of other 
characters moves. Although this is a time consuming task, anyone who read this 
should be a Tekken 3 nut, and are willing to do so. Use reversals when possible. 
Learn other characters popular 10-strings' breakpoints. Learn how, or more 
exactly, when to counter. Learn every other defensive technique,because some 
technique could be used on other characters too. King's d+1 is a great counter. 
Use it liberally when the opponent are in range. His ali kicks and d+4 kick is a 
great suprise move. The same can be said about his df+1 elbow sting. Switch 
between these counter moves to keep your opponent guessing. Learn which moves 
can be reversed, and also learn when to reverse yourself. If you ever ended up 
in a position where your back is facing the opponent, do either a d+1 or a d+4 
to realign and hit them at the same time.

- offense strategy -

     King's main offensive strategy involves poking technique, which will 
be discussed later. Poking is a series of simple attacks combined in a way 
that it keeps constant pressure on the opponent. Opponent facing a good 
poker should not be able to launch effective attacks, because it will be 
countered most of the time. Also, learn which of King's move will leave 
you open, and use them carefully. Throw out multis when possible.
     At close range( up close to throw range ), rely on King's in-close 
pokes, and try to throw when possible. Remember that the opponents can 
throw too, so learn to escape. Most escape sequences involves only punch 
buttons. An easy way to escape is to mash those buttons. You can also avoid 
throws by ducking, because most throws are high attacks. Juggling at this 
range is rather dangerous, because if it is blocked, the opponent should be 
able to inflict damage. However, don't be scared. Wait for an opening, 
like a missed throw or moves with long recovery time, and juggle away. 
There is not a lot of multis that you can do in this range. The jaguar 
driver -> boston crab is the only multis that are useful in this range.
     At medium range( just outside throw range to 2x sweep range ), King is 
a better fighter. Most of King's special techniques are designed for medium 
range fighting. Use his medium range poking technique and also use some of 
his special attacks, such as the jail kick, spinning elbow -> hand knife, 
ali kicks, elbow sting, flying cross chop, ultimate tackle, etc. Juggling 
is also possible, if you are close enough. If the opponent made a mistake
( long recovery moves, missed throw, etc. ), dash in( tap f ) and do a 
juggle, or a throw, or a special technique, or if the opponent have no 
reversals, do a 10-strings. If the opponent is about to launch an attack, 
do a side-step multipart. It will catch them most of the time( unless the 
opponent is really good ). Also remember that you can throw off a stun. 
Always change your strategy. Keep the opponent at bay.
     At a far range( outside 2x sweep range ), play an aggresive King. King 
really suffers at this range, but he is not that weak. Do a stomach smash, 
or do one of his drop kick moves. Remember to always follow the stomach 
smash with one of it's links. If it is not a counter hit, it is still safe. 
Try to get closer to the opponent, because King doesn't have many choices 
in this range.
     At a very, very far range( long enough that you can run safely ), rely 
on moves from the <run> position. There are a few moves King can do from a 
running position:

<run>+1+2 -> running cross chop ( hits mid )

<run>+3+4 -> sattelite drop kick ( hits high, sometimes mid )

<run>+4 -> running ali kicks ( hits low/ground )

<run>+<joystick on N about 4 or more characters length>
     -> ultimate tackle ( hits mid )

<run>+<joystick on N about less than 4 characters length>
     -> unblockable shoulder dash ( hits mid + unblockable )

* if the opponent is on the ground, unblockable shoulder dash turned into 
a running foot stomp

The unblockable dash will hit rising opponent, and it has a high priority. 
It will also set opponents up for another running attack, because when it 
hits, it pushes the opponent far enough. Countering the dash is VERY 
tricky. You can do an ali kick, but the timing is VERY crucial. Do NOT do a
lighting ankle kick when the opponent is doing the unblockable dash, or you
will pay for it. You can also try to roll away( 1,1 ), but the timing is 
also VERY crucial. The running ali kicks offer a great alternative for the 
dash, by the fact that it hits low. The running cross chop hits mid, and it 
also stuns. The sattelite drop kick has quite a range. Use it when you are 
about 3 characters away.

=========================================================================

**** Poking Strategies ****
     
     King's best poking moves are as follows: 

d+1: not a special move, but acts like one. This move pops so quickly that 
most people who attack aggresively can't block it. It's a special mid attack 
so it can be blocked from a crouching or standing position. Very useful for
stopping aggresive opponents.

d+1,n+2: this move is incredibly fast, and pops people out of everything 
and hits mid with the second hit. Alternate with d+1 and d+4. This move 
also can be started from a croucing position. Just tap 1 and do the n+2 
right away. 

d+4: this is just a little tap kick to change them up. It will not hit 
people on the ground, though.

df+3: use this when you push them out of range with d+1,n+2, to keep them 
from running in on you.  

uf+4: this move hits mid, and it will juggle, so it can keep them from 
ducking your throws. 

df+1: this is King's best counter move. It is very quick, has good damage, 
and puts people on the ground when it is a counter hit. It has a lengthy 
recovery time, but the advantages outweights the disadvantages.

df+2: this move doesn't have a lot of range, but it is quick enough that 
you can use it as an up close counter move.

df+4: this low savate kick hits low, and it is quick and useful up close. 
Use this with conjunction with other moves to keep your opponent guessing.

ws+2 or ws+4: these are use if someone ducks after a d+4 or a d+1. Both 
moves hits mid. WS+2 will leave you open for a while, but it could juggle 
on counter hit. WS+4 does not juggle, but it is safer to do.  

d+3+4: often, one stagger kick is good for surprise hits. Use it when they 
are backing away. DO NOT DO MORE THAN 1 AGAINST A GOOD PLAYER. They will 
always block the mid smash or the next ali because they are good at 
telegraphing moves. 

1,2 and 2,1: good quick counter jabs. the 1,2 hits high on both, and the 
2,1 hits high then medium. Good against opponents who tried to rush in.

Now that you know the moves listed above, here is strategies on how to use 
them: 

     Use d+1, df+2, df+1 and d+1,n+2 when you are close. It will keep your 
opponent from attacking you. Learn the range of these moves. If you are out 
of range, they can hit you or reverse the n+2. Try to chicken out if they 
reverse. If used correctly, these moves will make your opponents nervous 
and hesitant to attack. 
     Now start doing d+1 or d+4. The d+4 will usually hit quite often. 
After the d+4, you can repeat the move, or do a WS+4, or if they are in 
range, do d+1,n+2( you can hold down and hit 1 then N 2 ). After you have 
established a pattern, change up with an uf+4. If they are expecting a low 
attack, they will get juggled. You can also use this move as a counter. It 
usually pop them out of just about everything they tried after d+1,n+2, 
except 1,2 punches. You can also do a 1+2,1 after establishing a pattern 
for more variation. The 1 is a guaranteed hit if the 1+2 connects. You can 
also change up by using 1,2 or 2,1 punches, especially if you were getting 
hit by hits after the d+1,n+2. If your opponent makes a mistake, do hop 
kick and juggle. Dont try to throw, because they can be ducked, so they 
are less reliable. 
     At medium range, do a df+1, or df+3, or df+4. Toss in a special move 
every once in a while. Throw in moves that you think might hit, like, b+4 
or f,f+2 or f,f+4 or f,f,n+2. You can also use 1+2,1. The 1+2 might miss, 
but the 1 will hit as a counter, if the opponent tried to attack, or it 
will push the opponent away if they are blocking. Also try D,df+1 to set 
them up for ground traps.
     The strategy given here is not a pattern. It is important to be very 
unpredictable. The opponent will beat you if you stick to just one pattern. 
Also, as a general rule, chicken out of reversals if you see them coming. 
Be agressive with your pokes, and stay close. 

=========================================================================

**** Ground Traps/ Okizeme Strategies ****
     
     There are a few ways to set up your ground traps. Do an ankle smash
( D,df+1 ) to put them on the ground. After doing linkers or throws, King 
usually drops the opponent on the ground. The same can be said after a 
juggle or some regular moves.
     When you knock someone down, you have to second guess what they will 
do. Will they lay there, or will they roll to the side, or will they sweep, 
or will they do a lightning ankle kick, or will they get up with a mid 
kick, or will they roll forward or backward. If you know the opponent well, 
you probably know the answer already. If you think they will get up with 
any of the three kicks, here is a little secret that 1TruKing discovered. 
King can reverse the mid kick, sweep, and the ankle kick. If you are in a 
situation where you think you will be kicked, but can't decide, you have 
a 50/50 chance of being succesful. 
     If you think they will roll to the side, either do one stagger kick 
or try the moonsault press on them. If they roll back, do a stagger kick 
-> mid smash( d+3+4,2 ) to keep them on the ground. The same goes if they 
roll forward.  If you think they will just lay there, do a ground throw 
and second guess them after that. 
     If you are too far for a ground throw, you can use the frankensteiner 
when you are in range, because it will hit grounded opponent. The elbow 
drop and the standard uf+2 is a great alternative to the frankensteiner. 
Use 3 ali kicks if they stayed down there long enough. Also use the 
moonsault press if you are out of his sweep range. If the press connects 
always press 3 to sweep them. This move will connect most of the time, if 
the opponent head is in your direction.
     If you are about 1.5x or 2x sweep range away, the best thing to do is 
to back up and let them get up. In this range, they can successfully get up 
and avoid your ground traps. Good players usually gets up pretty fast, 
sometimes fast enough to avoid your traps. They also knows how to use 
ground recovery techniques properly. If your opponent mistakenly gets up 
with a sweep or a rising kick and missed, and you are not in reversal 
range, dash in and either throw or juggle or, when possible, do a 
10-string. For more variation, dash in and just start poking. If the 
opponent tends to stay on the ground, dash in and start doing ground 
traps. You can also try the flying cross chop for more variation.

=========================================================================

**** Ground Recovery Strategies ****

     This section deals with your options when you are on the ground. 
King's options from the grounded position is as follows:

b,B+3+4 -> "torpedo spin" ( hits mid + ends in a back turned position )

b,F+1+2 -> roll back -> cross chop ( hits mid + stuns )

f,F+1+2 -> roll forward -> cross chop ( hits mid + stuns )

3 -> rising sweep ( hits low )

4 -> rising mid kick ( hits mid )

d+4 -> lighting ankle kick ( hits low )

1 -> roll over

b OR f -> roll back OR roll forward, and then get up

u OR d OR 2 -> get up

~1 OR ~2 OR ~3 OR ~4 -> tech-roll
     
     The key is to vary your actions. If you are sure you are being ground 
trapped, your best bet is to do a lighting ankle kick. However, the timing 
is VERY crucial. If you succeed, the opponent will be stunned and you will 
have time to get up. If you are around the sweep range, use the rising 
sweep or the rising mid kick. Be sure to randomly change between these 2 
so your opponent will not adjust properly.
     If the opponent is about 4 characters away, use the cross chop moves 
to attack them. They are not far enough to use the running attacks tactics. 
Use the roll forward variation if they appears to just standing there or 
backing away. Use the roll back variation if they appears to be running 
at you. You can try to use the torpedo spin, but this is a very dangerous 
move. If this move is blocked, you will leave yourself wide open for a 
back throw. Use this move when you know for sure that it will hit.
     If the opponent is far enough( around 8 or more characters away ) to 
use the running attacks, and are running toward you, your best move is 
just to stay down and take the hit. If you get up, you are risking the 
chance that the opponent might do an unblockable shoulder dash, which is 
about 90% of the time. You can try to counter with the ground recovery 
moves listed above, but the timing is VERY HARD. Your best defense against 
this is not to be that far away in the first place.
     The roll over technique can be combined with the roll moves. Tap 1, 
and then tap b to roll over and roll back, or tap 1 then tap b to roll 
over and roll forward. Tapping 1,2 results in rolling over and getting up.
	Another thing that you can do to get off the ground is a technique 
called techroll, or quickroll (qr for short) . To do a techroll, press any 
button withing 3 frames after you hit the ground. Pressing 1 or 2 will
tech you into the background, while hitting 3 or 4 will tech you into the 
foreground. Techroll will often save you from being ground-trapped, but 
use techroll wisely. If your opponent is expecting it, it will lose its 
advantage, and endanger you at the same time. When you techroll, you will 
end up in a crouching position. You can also techroll some throws. Here is
a list of throws you can tech from:

Giant Swing - f,b,db,d,df,f+1 (King)
Stonehead - f,f+1+2 (Jin, Heihachi) f,f+1+4 (Kuma)
Knee Bash - f,f+3+4 (Law)
Gigaton Punishment - uf+1+2,d,DF+2 (Gun Jack)

This info is especially useful against the Giant Swing, because if you tech
roll this throw, it will lessened the damage from 70 pts to 35 pts.

=========================================================================

**** 10-Strings Strategies ****

     This section talks about King's 10-strings, their intricacies, when 
to use them, its breakpoints, and stuff relating to it. Here is a diagram 
on the sequences for the strings:
                       
                                +-> 1
                                |
            +-> 2,{4},4,4,{1} --+-> 3
            |          
1,2,1,{1} --+-> 3,{3},4 --+-> {3},2,1+2
                          |
                          +-> 4,{1} --+-> 3
                                      |
                                      +-> 1

* brackets indicates guard/break points

King might not be the king of 10-strings( that honor goes to Jin ), but he 
has enough to be effective. King even has a 10-strings that could end up 
in a powerbomb. His 10-strings can also be converted to a 9-string by 
starting the strings on the second hit, by pressing F+2.
     The weaknesses in King's strings are located in the 4th, 6th and the 
9th hits. These are the points where the strings can easily be reversed. 
Use the strings sparingly against a reversal-happy people. Characters with 
low counters can breaks the 6th hit of King's original TK1's 10-strings, 
but it will not cost any damage, and most people doesn't use low counters. 
The escape for the powerbomb ender is 1+2.
     On the string that ended w/ a powerbomb, you can do a lot of things if 
the 9th hit connect. The 9th hit is a stun hit. When you catch your 
opponent with it, you can either choose to end it with the powerbomb, or 
juggle him/her with uf+4, throw them, or use King's assortment of powerful 
moves to do your opponent in, such as 1+2,1.
     The best way of using 10-strings is to learn all of King's 10-strings 
and alternate between them. Again, the main point here is VARIATION. You 
can also ends the string prematurely, when you feel that the opponent can 
blocked or reversed them. For the original TK1 strings, the 3rd, 5th and 
9th hits are good points to stop. For the powerbomb string, the 3rd and 
5th hits are good stop points. For the spinning kicks to ali kicks string, 
the 3rd, 5th and 9thhits are good stop points. It's good to end the strings 
early sometimes, because the 3 and 1 ender has a long recovery time.

=========================================================================

**** Juggles Strategy ****

	King has 3 conventional and a few unusual juggle starters. Here are
the conventional ones:

1. uf+4 hop kick
2. f,f+2 or ws+2 uppercut (ch)
3. f,n,d,df,n+1+2 crouching knuckle bomb (ch)

and here are the unconventional ones:

4. D,df+1 ankle smash
5. standing 4 (ch)
6. (face down feet toward) 3 sweep

Of all these starter, the hop kick is the most useful one, because it is 
easy to execute and the recovery time is quick. The uppercuts are also 
quick, but the recovery time is rather long. The crouching knuckle bomb
starter is the hardest one to setup, but does the most damage. Since it
requires King to crouch dash first, do it from 2x d+3 sweep range.
	Now, on to the actual juggles itself. Here's some juggles that I have
right now. You won't see a lot of juggles here, because King is not a 
juggler, and I don't know a lot of juggles for King... :o). Here we go:

(?) = needs to be tested

from uf+4, f,f+2, ws+2, and f,n,d,df,n+1+2:
-------------------------------------------
<starter>,2,1,1+2,1
<starter>,2,1,df+2,d+3+4,2
<starter>,1,2,df+1,d+3+4,2 (?)
<starter>,2,1,b+4,1+4 (the 1+4 can be avoided by tech-rolling)
<starter>,1,uf+4,d+3+4,2 (?)

from D,df+1:
------------
<starter>,ws+1,2,1,b+4
<starter>,ws+4,d+3+4,2
<starter>,ws+1,df+2,d+3+4,2 (?)
<starter>,ws+4,df+1,d+3+4,2 (?)

from standing 4:
----------------
<starter>,d+3+4,2

from (face down feet toward) 3:
-------------------------------
<starter>,ws+1,df+2,d+3+4,2 (?)
<starter>,ws+4,df+1,d+3+4,2 (?)

That is all I know for now.... if you have any King juggles, PLEASE e-mail it
to me at dfdp5@hotmail.com

=========================================================================

**** Stun Moves Strategy ****

	Stuns are the most interesting part of the Tekken gameplay. Stuns allows
you to get one or more hits or throws. To get a stun, you must do a move at
the right time so that it will hit as a major counter( you can tell if it is 
a major counter if the sparks surrounding the hit area is quite big ). Some
moves will knock you away or juggles or just cause more damage, but some will 
stun. Here is a list of King's moves that will cause a stun:

df+1: elbow sting. This move don't exactly stun, but on major counter, this
move will put your opponent on the ground, face down, ready for your ground
trap games. If they block it, the move will stun opponents. It also has a 
good range. However, the recovery time is quite long, so make sure that the
move will make contact

f,f,n+2: the good old stomach smash. You can either link to a throw from it,
or juggle. The move hits low, making it easier to get a major counter. However,
the f,f,n part requires King to dash first, making this move useless in range
0-1. Make sure you are quite far away( around range 2-3 ) when you want to 
use this move.

d+3+4: stagger kick. One of the easiest stun move King has. It hits low, making
it easier to stun someone. However, there's only a limited number of things
you can do after this move. The only available options are to follow it with 
the 2, one of the ws+ moves, or continue to press 4 for up to five stagger
kick. BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU DO THIS MOVE. The recovery time is very, very long.
Make sure this move connects!

ss+2: dark arrow. One of the harder move to set up. The sidestep factor allows
you to avoid attacking enemies, improving your chance to get a stun. You can
also ss-buffer the 2. On regular hit, it will just punch your opponent across
the screen.

	Here's a list of the things you can do after you connect with a stun move:

(?) = needs to be tested

from df+1:
----------
<stun>,d+3+4,2
<stun>,dash in, ground throw

from f,f,n+2 and ss+2:
----------------------
<stun>,uf+4 -> any juggle from uf+4
<stun>,1+2,1
<stun>,any throw except ground/crouch throws (not sure if throws can be escaped;
       and timing is strict)
<stun>,(let them fall to the ground),ground throws (?)

from d+3+4:
-----------
<stun>~4,4,4,4
<stun>~4,2 (if d+3+4 is a ch, you can use the 2 after the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
      stagger kick)

dat is all i have fer now...

=========================================================================

**** Custom Combos ****

	Custom Combo is a way of applying constant pressure, usually by chaining
simple moves together so that the opponent have no chance of retaliating. 
Unfortunately for us, King really suffers in this department. However, this
does not mean that we shouldn't use what we have.
	King's custom combo usually consist of simple moves. I will categorize
these moves into 3 categories: 

high combo potential moves - moves that's easy to custom-combo from. Perfect
	for starting or linking a custom combo.
mid combo potential moves - not as easy to combo from like the 1st category.
	Can be used either in linking or ending a custom combo
low combo potential moves - very hard to custom-combo from. Best used to end
	a custom combo

Here is a list of them:

high combo potential:
D+1 (low punch recovering in a crouching position)
d+1 (low punch recovering in a standing position)
D+4
2,1
1,2
df+2
1

mid combo potential:
ws+1
d+1~n+2
D+3
df+3
df+4

low combo potential:
df+3
ws+2
uf+4
df+1
b+4
1+2,1
ws+4
d+3+4,2 (always do d+1 quickly right after it to avoid any retaliation)

The general rule is that the custom-combo goes from the high -> mid -> low
potential moves. However, this is not absolute.
	The secret of creating custom combos are located in using the moves
listed above to create a constant barrage of attacks that is hard to break.
Here is an example:

df+2,d+1~n+2,d+1,ws+4

This string is rather defensive in nature. The df+2 is just there to 
interrupt charging opponent, and can be ommited if you want. The d+1~n+2
moves you forward a little bit. The d+1 again stops any incoming retaliation,
and sets up ws+4, which have the same job.
	Here is another example:

2,1,d+1~n+2,df+1

This one is an offensive string. The 2,1 sets up the d+1~n+2, and the df+1
finish them off.
	I can't give you much info in this area because I'm still learning it
too, but I hope i've given you enough info to start. One last thing to 
remember is that alert opponents who uses characters with attack reversal
can reverse your custom-combos. To avoid this, be unpredictable, and be
ready to use chickens.

**** Vs Characters Strategies ****

     Once again, thanks to 1TruKing for giving me these strategies. These 
are based on the type of fighters I and 1TruKing have encountered. Once 
again, if you see any mistakes, or if you want to make suggestions, just 
e-mail them to dfdp5@hotmail.com.

vs Ling Xiaoyu
--------------
     Ling is very quick and dodges a lot, so you want to be careful against 
her. When she goes into Phoenix stance, do the frankensteiner or start side 
stepping to confuse your opponent. If you manage to get behind her by side 
stepping, use the ali kicks, and you should be able to get all five. The 
frankensteiner is pretty safe. It wont connect and throw her, but it will 
knock her out of the stance, and even if she hits you, she can't juggle you 
because you are already airborne. If you are about a sweep away, you can do 
1 ali kick to get her out of the stance. If you are out of her Phoenix 
stance moves range, do a moonsault press. The range is about 2x sweep. You 
can also crouch throw her when she is in the Art of Phoenix stance.
     Against a dodging Ling, pick your spots carefully. When she turns her 
back close to you go into d+1,n+2 to get her away from you. It is fairly 
safe if your timing is good. If you block her <back turned>+4, do a b+4 
turnaround kick, and you should hit her before she can block. Stay away 
from her side step and be careful of her juggles.
     Here is a list of Ling's strings and their hit level:

u+4,1,2,1+2,1,3,4,4,4,1             - Tenstring - MHHMMLLLMM
u+4,1,2,4,4,2,1+2,1,4,2             - Tenstring - MHHLLMHMLM

Right now, I have no specific defense against her strings. Try to learn 
where to block is the best advice I can give, right now. If you know any 
defensive tactics against her strings, e-mail me at dfdp5@hotmail.com.
     Since Ling is the smallest fighter in the game, it is hard to juggle 
and ground trap her. Be sure that you are in range for the juggle. If you 
plan to ground trap her, use 1 or 2 ali kicks, or the ali kick -> mid 
smash combo. Do not try to ground throw her, unless you are really close. 
Refrain from using too much multis because she is so damn quick. The best 
way to go is to poke her to death.

vs Yoshimitsu
-------------
     There are only a few people who know how to use Yoshi properly. Yoshi's 
strong points are his poke tactics( 1, df+2, df+4, d+4 ) and his breath. 
Stay on them and do d1,2 to move in and knock them out of their poke. If 
they become predictable with the df+4 reverse it and ground trap them. 
Watch out for the breath. It has nasty juggle potential. Keep on them and 
do a lot of poking to keep them out of their poke.  
     Yoshi has 2 unique stances. The sitting stance allows him to regain 
life and some other stuff. When you are in range, ali kick him immediately. 
If you are not, dash in and ali kick him. Do not allow him to regain life. 
The other stance is the pogo stick stance. Do NOT use any low attacks on 
him when he is in this stance. Just simply jab him out of it. Mid attacks 
is also risky. You can also use Moonsault Press( 1+4 ) to press him down.
     Non pros tends to leave themselves wide open. You can play them like 
you would any body else. Use d+1,n+2, juggles, reverse, etc. Most non pros 
over uses the 3,4 kicks. The second hits is very delayed, so it is easily 
seen, and easily reversed. They also tends to overuse the triple spin kicks. 
Try to reverse the 2nd one.
     The weakpoinst in Yoshi's 10 strings is as follows. If he starts with 
the 1,2,1 combination, reverse the 4th hit, which is a high kick. If the 
1st hit is a counter, you should still be able to reverse the 4th hit. If 
he uses the 4,4 starter, reverse the 2nd hit. If the first one is a counter, 
keep blocking and use d+1 to counter the 4th hit, a high punch. If the 5th 
hit is delayed, then it is the 1 ending. Use ali kick or b+4 to knock him 
out of that move. Here is a list of his strings and their hit level:

1,2,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1           - Tenstring   - HMMHHLM!!!
1,2,1,4,2,2,2,4,1,1           - Tenstring   - HMMHMMMM!!
4,4,2,2,4,4,1,1,1,1           - Tenstring   - HHMHHLM!!!
1,2,1,4,4,4,1,3+4             - Eightstring - HMMHHLMM
4,4,2,2,4,4,1,3+4             - Eightstring - HHHHHLMM
4,4,2,2,1                     - Fivestring  - HHMH!

     Linking is kind of though against Yoshi because his kicks spins 360 
degrees around him, so you could get hit when you do the side step multi. 
You can link against non pros effectively. 
     If you don't know how to use yoshi right, there is not much you can 
do with him.

vs Nina Williams
----------------
     Hard match but winnable for King. If you face a good poking Nina, you 
need to turtle until you see an opening. You must remember your low counter 
because a lot of her poke is low based. Anticipate a low attack, counter it, 
and dash in and hop kick for a nice juggle. She is kick heavy so you can 
try to reverse her kicks, but they are fast and it goes hi and low so well 
that it is risky, unless you are positive it is coming.  If she does d+4,1 
try to duck the 1, even if you were hit by the d+4. If you do duck, use 
d+1,n+2, WS+4, or go for a hop kick. The hop kick might not be guaranteed. 
You can also throw her.  
     If the Nina is more defensive move in with df+1, d+1,n+2 and stay on 
her with standard poke. They key is to pressure them. If they are not 
poking they probably would try to throw out her power moves, like the 
blonde bomb. Watch for it, block it, and immediately go into the turnaround 
kick. If you dare, dash in and throw her. 
     Nina has multipart capabilities also. Learn the break sequences of her 
multiparts. She has no side step multis. Most of her starters are a dash-in 
starter. If you see it, do a d+1 for a counter. Her other starter are a 
sway starter, where she swayed back and then tries to grab you. Be careful 
when you see her swaying back.
     The weakness in Nina's 10-strings are located at the 5th and 6th hit. 
In all of her strings, the 5th hit is a mid/high kick. Reverse the 5th hit 
if you like. The 6th hit is a low hit. Break that hit by using low counters. 
If you were unable to do those, remember that Nina's most popular strings 
have the following attack level for the last 3 hit: MLM. Don't forget to 
block low for the 9th hit. Here is a list of her strings and their hit 
level:

1,2,1,2,3,3,2,1,2,4               - Tenstring - HHHHMLHHHM
df+1,2,1,2,3,3,2,1,2,4            - Tenstring - MHHHMLHHHM
WS+1,2,1,2,3,3,2,1,2,4            - Tenstring - MHHHMLHHHM
1,2,1,2,3,3,2,1,4,3               - Tenstring - HHHHMLHHLM
df+1,2,1,2,3,3,2,1,4,3            - Tenstring - MHHHMLHHLM
WS+1,2,1,2,3,3,2,1,4,3            - Tenstring - MHHHMLHHLM
1,2,1,2,4,3,4,2,4,3               - Tenstring - HHHHHLLMLM
df+1,2,1,2,4,3,4,2,4,3            - Tenstring - MHHHHLLMLM
WS+1,2,1,2,4,3,4,2,4,3            - Tenstring - MHHHHLLMLM

     A tough Nina to face are the poking Nina. Typical Nina isn't that hard. 
Just keep on the attack, and don't let her attack, and you should be fine.

vs Forrest Law
--------------
     Forrest has a strong poking technique, but not quite at Nina's level. 
Typical poke for Forrest starts off with b+2, and not finishing the combo. 
They just going into a string, like d+2,3, d+2, d+4, ws+4, etc... If they 
are poking, you can use d+1,n+2 after the b+2 is blocked, and you can hit 
them before they can block or go into another move. If they continue the 
combo do a low counter and juggle them. His flip kicks are easy to see, so 
try to reverse it and trap them off the reverse. Most Laws like to throw, 
so watch out if they dash in on you. Use low pokes against them. D+1,n+2 
and df+1 is effective against a dashing opponent.  Here's a tip on how to 
defend against the b+2 poke starter. If you expect it and have great timing 
you can throw him as he comes in with the 2.   
     If they don't poke with Law, they probably use his junkyard combo
( b+2,3,4 ) and his dragon storm combo( b+1,2,1 ) or his flip kicks. If 
they use the junkyard, counter the second hit and punish. They will 
probably figure out that it is a bad idea to do it and stop. Remember, 
that the junkyard starts with left punch, not right punch. The dragon 
storm has a long recovery time, but they are able to block. So throw 
immediately after you block the last hit. If they delay it, be ready to 
pop them with a juggle. If they use flip kicks a lot, either reverse them, 
or hit them with a mid hit when they land. It is guarenteed if you time it 
right. You can also do a hop kick to pop them. Do not throw after a missed 
flip, because they might flip again or stay ducking. Watch out for his 
dragons tail sweep( db+4 ). If you see it coming, block and hop kick or 
throw. You can also try to low counter it for what should be a guarenteed 
juggle.  
     The break point in Law's 10-strings is located in the 5th and 6th hit. 
The 5th hit is a mid kick. Reverse that sucker. The 6th hit is a low hit, 
so use low counter to break it. Here is a list of his strings and their 
hit level:

df+1,2,2,1,3,3,3,4,3,4                  - Tenstring - MHHHMLMHHM
df+1,2,2,1,3,3,3,3,4,4                  - Tenstring - MHHHMLMHLM
df+1,2,2,1,3,3,3,4,4,4                  - Tenstring - MHHHMLMHLM
df+1,3,2,2,3,d+3,3,3,4,4                - Tenstring - MHHHMLMHLM
df+1,3,2,2,3,d+3,3,4,3,4                - Tenstring - MLMHMLMHHM
df+1,3,2,2,3,d+3,3,4,4,4                - Tenstring - MLMHMLMHLM

     Law is slow if they don't know how to poke effectively. So use quick 
attacks like the d+1,2 and df+1 to pressure them.

vs Hwoarang
-----------
     Most people say that King will certainly win this match, due to his 
kick reversal, but when Hwoarang is played correctly it is a tough match. 
Poking Hwoarangs tend to punch more and throw often. Watch for their 
sidesteps and don't throw out random moves that leave you vulnerable, or 
you may find yourself being sidethrown or juggled. 
     When playing against Hwoarang, Kick reverse or low counter everything 
possible. Remember his d+4,4 hits low then high. So duck the second hit 
even if you get hit by the first one. The 2nd hit only connects on a 
counter hit. They will be wide open for a throw, a juggle or whatever. 
Against a poking Hwoarang, you want to watch out for his 1,1,3,3. It does 
2 hi, then a low, and then a hi. If you see it coming out duck and attack 
before he can get to the 3. If you cannot, duck and block the first three. 
The second will go over your head and you can throw or juggle them. When 
you know a kick is coming, reverse it, and trap him. Try and get them to 
stop throwing out random kicks.  Common combos you can reverse are the 
following. You can reverse or duck the 3,3,3,3 kick combo. The timing on 
the reverse is hard but it can be done. Another one is the d+4,4 combo. If 
you block the d+4, you can reverse the second hit, although ducking would 
be safer, since if you are trying to reverse, you are risking a juggle. 
Another common combo is the 3,3,3,4,4 combo. The first four in this combo 
can be possibly reversed, but I am not sure. Remember that the 4th hit can 
be low. 
     The weakness in Hwoarang's 10-strings are in the 7th and 8th hit. 
Those hits are just like the d+4,4 kick combo. Always block low on the 7th 
hit, because you will be juggled if the 7th hit connect. On the 8th hit, 
block high. There is a pause before the 9th hit, enough for a juggle or 
a turn around kick. You can try to reverse it, but the timing is rather 
hard.
     Against Hwoarang you either want to be on him pressuring him with poke 
or back in range 2 so you can see his strings coming and counter with df+1 
or b+4. I dont think you should have much problems with Hwoarang.

vs Eddy Gordo/Tiger
-------------------
     When playing against Eddy, you need to know if your opponent is a 
masher or skilled player so you can decide what to do. Against a masher, 
you want to play defensively so you can see what is coming. Use low 
counters and b+4 to knock him out of his stuff. Keep mashers on the ground. 
Use easy moves like d+4, d+1 or a simple d+3 to keep them down. Be careful 
when doing ali kicks to mid uppercut, because they can quickrise to easily.
     The stay back strategy works against good players as well, but their 
style has more diversity. The best thing to do is to learn Eddy's moves so 
you know what he can do. Once you know that, it is easy to beat him. If 
they do the vault sweep and you block it, do a low counter to reverse the 
coming sweeps. Duck if they go into hand stand at a distance. If they duck 
in the handstand stand up and block because the stakedriver is coming, 
which hits mid. The most common attacks in handstand are the handstand kick 
and the vault sweep, both of which you can block by ducking. The handstand 
kick is a special mid, so you can block high or low. If you do block it do 
whatever it takes to get him out of it. Try d+1, d+4,d+1,n+2 or d+3+4,2 to 
knock him out. If he does a vault sweep low counter him.  
     Eddy has no real effective 10-strings, since his strength are in the 
category of unusual moves. All of his 10-strings are predictable and easy 
to block. You can reverse the 2nd hit if you are close enough. The last 
hit is a stun hit, so you can't go after him when he's done.
     The best way to beat Eddy is to learn his moves so you know what he 
can do. Most of his move can be easily seen, if you are good enough. 
Remember that he is very dangerous out of the handstand. So try to knock 
him out of that position.

vs Paul Phoenix
---------------
     Paul is very difficult character with a great cheese factor. Paul are 
used to the fact that opponents are not attacking them wildly, because of 
the death fist and the falling leaf. They feel they are safe from an 
assault, and that is where their problem lies. Both moves are useful only 
at a distance because they take some time to come out. Stay on him and do 
d+1 and d+1,n+2 often at the start of the match, and continue to dash in 
and poke. It is very hard to reverse these attacks. The death fist and the 
falling leaf can be stopped by the d+1 variants, if you do it quick enough. 
If they are playing turtle, dash in and switch to throws, and vary between 
different throws. Use throws that keeps you close to them, like the figure 
four( db+1+2 ) or his knee bash( df+2+3 ). If they are frustrated and 
starting to miss with their moves, try to throw or juggle them. 
     When playing Paul, make sure you don't get into the range of the death 
fist and falling leaf where you can't counter it. You can easily fall in 
the right range through poking and get tagged with the deathfist. If you 
play him correctly, the Paul player realizes that he can't out skill you, 
and should be overusing the deathfist and the falling leaf. Move to the 
outside of the falling leaf sweep range. If they do the falling leaf, they 
should miss. Try to throw or juggle them. The deathfist will push you away 
a little, but not long enough for them to be safe. Use 1 ali kick or the 
jail kick to hit them. If you have the reflex, and the guts, try to low 
cancel the sweep in the falling leaf combo.
     Paul has the strongest 10-strings in the game. However, they are easy 
to defend against. Here is a few tips on how to defend against them. If the 
5th hit is low then the 9th hit is also low. Block low on the 9th hit and 
high on the 10th hit to avoid major damage. You can also try to low counter 
this particular 9th hit. If the 5th hit is a mid/high, then the 8th hit of 
this string is the low hit, and the 9th and 10th hit are mid. Block low or 
low counter it. Otherwise, block mid on all the hit. Be careful if the 4th 
hit is a tile splitter. Paul can either go to a death fist or continue the 
10 string from this hit. See which one your opponent prefers, and guess 
very very carefully. Here is a list of his strings and their hit level:

1,2,3,2,1,2,1,4,2,1           - Tenstring  - HHMHMHHLMM
1,2,3,1,4,2,1,4,2,1           - Tenstring  - HHMMLMHMLM
1,2,3,1,2                     - Fivestring - HHMMM

     The constant d+1,n+2 will not work against a good player for long, so 
just go into other poke tactics, but the main point is to pressure him and 
stay on him. When they do a tile splitter( d+1 ), do d+1,n+2 right away, 
and it should knock him out of the deathfist or the falling leaf before 
they can come out. The timing is NOT forgiving, though. Use low counters 
if you know for sure that the falling leaf is coming. Use these tactics 
for some serious Paul frustration.

vs King
-------
     If they poke, poke back. If they try to throw, avoid it and juggle. If 
they use the sidestep, duck and wait. When he's done with the sequence, do 
a d+1 quickly to get on track and hit them at the same time. If you study 
this faq, you should know King's weakness, I hope. Most players will do an 
ali kick variations after the first ali kick. Watch, and you can tell if 
the mid upper or another ali is coming. Block them and do a hop kick. You 
can also try to throw them, if they missed, with the side step starters.
     If you are on the ground, you are in a very big trouble, because King 
has great ground traps technique. If you see an ali kick coming, do a d+4 
to counter it. Learn the escapes for his ground throws if you see it 
coming. The escapes are pretty easy to memorize. Here is a description:

left-side ground throw: lp
right-side ground throw: rp
head-toward ground throw: lp+rp
feet-toward ground throws: lk+rk

If you see a moonsault press, either roll back or roll to the side. Finally, 
if they completely missed, use a rising sweep to drop them to the ground. 
This should work on all characters, not King only.
     The section entitled "10-strings Strategies" above have the details on 
defending yourself against King's 10-strings.
     If you know King, then you should know his weaknesses too.

vs Lei Wulong
-------------
     Most Leis are either the rushing punch/stance switch Lei, or the 
laying down too much Lei. Few player incorporate both tactics. When playing 
against a stance switcher, remember that Lei sidesteps when he switch 
stances. Tap f or b to adjust and see what their stance is. If it is the 
panther stance, go for a mid attack, such as df+1, because Lei can't block 
mid attacks in that stance. He does have automatic low blocking, though. 
For other stances, use low attacks, because that is the weakness of the 
other stances. If they switch stances at a distance, do the exploder, or 
the boomerang kick, or the ankle breaker to knock them out. If they switch 
up close, track them and pop them with d+1,n+2 or a throw.  
     If they like to switch off the rush punches, you can counter them with 
a d+1. The order of the switch are:

off 1st punch: snake
off 2nd punch: dragon
off 3rd punch: panther
off 4th punch: tiger
off mid kick: crane

You can throw when he switch stances, except for the third punch, which is 
a panther. Use crouching throws to throw them off the panther stance, or 
try to hop kick them for a juggle. If they go into crane in close range, 
throw them, or use anything high, because they can't block high. If they 
got into the crane at a distance do the jumping sideswipe. If they are in 
any stance, except panther, and they are at a distance,  a boomerang kick 
is effective because they can't block high. To knock them out against 
panther, try the moonsault press, or his mid savate kick( df+3 ). Remember 
that Lei has a reversal against low attacks in panther.  
     When Lei is in one of his stances, the best thing to do is back away 
and wait until he did something. Usually the move will return him into his 
normal stance. If you cannot back away safely, or you are too close, do a 
df+1 to knock him out of it. If you are in a range where df+1 will not 
connect, use df+3 or ali kick, depending on the stance he is in. Don't use 
the ali kick when he is in the panther.
     Another of Lei's dangerous stance are the back turned stance. He has 
so many moves from this stance, including the cheap low punch infinity 
juggle. If you are too close, just knock him out with quick move such as 
df+2 or df+1 or a simple d+1. Lei cannot block in this stance. If you are 
out of these moves range, do ali kicks, and all 3 of them should connect. 
Feel free to do the drop kick moves if you can do it.
     If the are the lay down type, you need to know what they can do. In 
the d+3+4 play dead( fac up with feet away ), they are the most dangerous. 
Lei can do a launch kick that hits mid, or the rave spin or, a sweep into 
his rolling kicks( 4,3,3 ). Against this position, keep some distance and 
do ali kicks, moonsault press, or ankle breaker. Slide posistion (face down 
head toward, d+1+2) is the easiest to defend, because all of his attacks 
out of this position are low, so just block low. If he does a sweep, you 
should be able to counter him, then try the hop kick or one ali kick. If 
he does the slide block it and ground throw, or ws 4 and do a mini ground 
juggle. You can also throw out a low counter, when you seem him start to 
attack in this position. You might want to ali kick them if they are just 
laying there, or when they start to roll into play dead position. When Lei 
does his cartwheel( 4~3 ), he ends up in a face down feet towards position. 
From this position, he can do the cartwheel again. This cartwheel has quite 
a range and hits mid, so if you are moving in on them in this position be 
ready for a reversal of the mid kick. They can also do a rave spin, rave 
sweep or rave sweep to play dead positon, so be careful. Use ali kick or 
moonsault body press to defend yourself.  
     If they start their ten string, remember that the third hit is low, 
and if you get hit, you are stunned and can't retaliate. So block it low 
and do a d+1 right after. It will stop anything they are trying to do, 
even the 10-strings. You can also low counter the 3rd hit, and juggle them. 
Here is a list of his strings and their hit level:

1,2,1,3+4,1,2,4,1,4,4               - Tenstring  - HHLMMMHMLH
1,2,1,3+4,1,2,4,1,2,3               - Tenstring  - HHLMMMHMMH
1,2,1,3+4,3+4,3+4,1,1,2             - Ninestring - HHLMMMLLM

If you missed the low counter, block mid right away. If they only do 1 flip 
kick, block low on the 9th hit. You may get hit by the 2, but you will not 
be hit by the 3. If they do 3 flip, block low on the 7th and 8th, and block 
high on the 9th hit. If they do the strings with the 3 backflips, pop them 
with d+1, n+2 between the flips. If you are good, ali kick them, and 
you'll get all 5 and Lei would be knock down for a ground trap. However, 
be careful, because Lei could change up from the flip into one of his 
back-turned moves.
     Lei is a nasty character, and has the ability to be in the top 5. Be 
careful when playing against him.

vs Jin Kazama
-------------
     Jin is nasty when played correct.  You need to pick your spots against 
a poking Jin. They do a lot of df+1,2 or just df+1, or d+4, or the 1,1,2 
combo, or the stun punch combos b,f+2,1,2, and the occasional hell sweep. 
Wait and see what their typical pattern is. Against the df+1, block and go 
d1,2 right after. If they do 1,1 a lot duck and hit them. If they do 1,1,2, 
block and go for a hop kick. Be ready to chicken it( f+2+4 ) if they 
reverse it. Dont let them do the hell sweep( f,n,d,df+4,4 ) up close, 
because you will be juggled and it cost good damage. When they stop 
attacking you, start attacking your self, so they can't set up. When jin 
is knocked back by his poking, or your poking, and he tries to dash in, 
tap 1,2 or 2,1 to make sure he doesn't throw to you his jumping hell sweeps. 
If they do, low counter the first or second sweep. Only morons would do 
all four against king, but if they do, reverse it. If you are stunned by 
the 1st hit of the stun punch combo, hold forward on the 2nd hit, and you 
will break the stun and the last hit will be blocked. Jin's f,f+2 rush 
punch has a recovery time, long enough to get an attack in. Most non poke 
jins are not any harder than a poke jin so the same tactics should work for 
both of them.
     Jin is the king of strings in this game. He has tons of 10-strings, 
and he even has 2 11-strings. Here is a list of them:

b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,1,4             - Elevenstring - HHMLMMLHHMM
b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,1,3             - Elevenstring - HHMLMMLHHML
b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,3+4             - Elevenstring - HHMLMMLHHMM
f,f,n+2,1,2,2,3,4,4,1,2,1           - Tenstring    - HHHHHMLHMH
f,f,n+2,1,2,2,3,4,4,3,2,1           - Tenstring    - HHHHHMLLM!
3,2,4,3,1+4,2,2,1,2                 - Tenstring    - HHMHLHHMMM
f,f,n+2,1,4,4,2,4,3,2,1             - Ninestring   - HHMMMMLM!
3,2,4,3,1+4,2,1,3                   - Ninestring   - HHMHLHHMM
3,2,4,3,1+4,2,1,4                   - Ninestring   - HHMHLHHML
3,2,4,3,1+4,1,3                     - Eightstring  - HHMHLHMM
3,2,4,3,1+4,1,4                     - Eightstring  - HHMHLHML

When facing the b+2 strings, reverse the 3rd hit or the 5th hit. Block low 
on the 4th hit, if you don't reverse the 3rd hit. If you are unable to do 
that, block low on the 7th hit, and just keep on blocking high. If the 10th 
hit is a dragon uppercut, try to anticipate whether the last hit is a mid 
kick or a sweep, and block accordingly. The best defense against these strings 
are to break it early. 
     Against the f,f 10-strings, the best thing to do is to either low 
counter the 7th hit or reverse the 6th hit. If you miss the low counter, 
block low on the 8th hit, then immediately block mid. If the 8th hit is a 
punch, just keep blocking high and you'll be ok. Try a b+4 after the last 
hit to hurt Jin. If the 8th hit is a low kick, then REMEMBER that the 10th 
hit is AN UNBLOCKABLE. As soon as you block the 9th hit, use d+1 or ali 
kick to stop Jin from doing the unblockable. 
     Against the 3,2,4,3 10-string, try to reverse the 4th hit, or you can 
duck the 4th hit and counter with a d+1. If you miss it, block low on the 
5th hit and high on the 6th hit, then just block high for the rest of the 
string. 
     Against the f,f 9-strings, remember that the 3rd hit is a right kick. 
When you see that, then you are sure that you are facing this string. The 
last hit is also an unblockable. Just block low on the 7th hit, block high 
on 8th hit, and try to counter the last hit. 
     Against the 3,2,4,3 9-strings and 8-strings, try to reverse the 4th 
hit. If you can't, block low on the 5th hit and high on the 6th and 7th 
hit. If the 8th hit is a dragon upper, anticipate the incoming mid 
kick/sweep and block accordingly. If the 7th hit is a dragon upper, do the 
same thing.
     To be good against Jin, you have to use all of your resources and 
skill. Try to see if your opponent are locked into a pattern, and use that 
to your advantage. Always try to break his strings early.

vs Bryan Fury
-------------
     Bryan is one of the more difficult character to play against, in both
human and CPU form. In addition to good strength, Bryan has low attacks that
is hard to guess. Bryan's good points are his precanned combos, which can
end in either low or high/mid attacks. Most of his precanned combos uses
punches, and since King cannot reverse punches, King is really at a
disadvantage when played against Bryan.
     Most Bryan player I know of uses the Snake Fang (b+1+2, don't know the 
exact name...) a lot. It is a damn good counter move. The good Bryan player 
memorize practically all of his combination moves, which is a lot. To play 
against a good Bryan, counters are the best defense. It's really hard to 
time the counter, but it is possible. King's best counter move against 
Bryan, and for everyone else, is the Elbow Sting( df+1 ). When you see 
Bryan moving in, and he is in range, use this move to put him on the 
ground. Use df+3 or df+4 when he is outside the Elbow Sting's range. When 
he is on the ground, use the ali kick -> mid punch combo for extra hits. 
There are some Bryan's moves that could be reversed, like the f+3,4,3 kick 
combo. Reverse them if you can. One combination that you should be aware of 
is the combinations that starts from a b+2, a spinning elbow. Combinations 
from these takes about 50-70 points of your health, especially when the 
b+2 is a counter hit. If you are able to block the b+2, keep blocking until 
the combinations are finished. However, if the b+2 hits as a counter, press 
F on the next hit to break the stun, and block the last hit. If the second 
hit was the last one, your out of luck.  
     Another good way to beat Bryan is to be offensive. However, do not be 
so offensively minded that you throw out moves that leaves you wide open. 
In addition to the Elbow Sting, use King's other poking moves, and do it 
in a random fashion. Do not fall into a pattern. Always keep the opponent 
in check by making them guess what you are going to do. Of course, do not 
use moves that leaves you wide open, such as the Grand Smash( f,f+2 ), or 
2 or more Ali Kicks.
     The weakness of Bryan's strings are the fact that there is no low 
attack in it, making it simple to defend against. However, the potential 
damage is great. The weak spot in his 10-strings are located in the 9th 
hit, which is a mid right kick. Reverse it if you can. I haven't had the 
chance to study his other strings, so I'm not sure about the weak spot on 
the other strings.
     Bryan is one of the more powerful character in the game. Be careful 
when playing against him, whether you are playing a masher or a pro.

vs Kuma
-------
     You thought that you are going to have an easy time with Kuma, until 
you saw that she took about 70 points out of your life bar with only 3 
hits. Kuma may be the slowest character of the game. But she is one of the 
strongest.
     When playing against Kuma, remember not to lose your concentration. 
One mistake and you could be gone. Since most of Kuma's attacks are punch 
based, counters comes in handy here. When you see the uppercut rush, use 
df+2 to interrupt it. The timing is rather hard though, and I'm not sure 
if df+1 will hit safely or not. Most of Kuma's move are either slow or it 
has a long recovery time, so it is easy to play defensively against Kuma. 
However, be aware of her/his( Kuma/Panda ) Cross Cut Saw( f,f+1+2 ). This 
is one of her or his fastest move. When you see that Kuma is doing her 
unblockable, check on how far you are from her. If you are close enough to 
inflict damage, go ahead, but if you are not, back away to about 2 sweep 
range outside the Claw Slash range. Kuma can either do her Claw Slash 
unblockable or do her Rolling Bear, which is blockable. Just block high/mid 
if the Rolling Bear comes out.
     Being offensive is not a very good idea against Kuma, since any wrong 
move can cost you the round. Instead, I suggest playing defensive. When you 
see an opening, go all out, either with a juggle, strings, or a multipart, 
or maybe a throw. Kuma has a lot of moves that leaves him wide open, so 
it's not hard to find an opening.
     Kuma has no known 10-strings.
     Kuma might looks easy to beat, but be careful.

vs Heihachi Mishima
-------------------
     Heihachi is one nasty guy. His Twin Pistons (df+1,2) is arguably the 
best move in the whole game. He also have a much, much better Hellsweeps 
(f,n,d,df+4,4,...) than Jin, or even Kazuya. He even have his own version 
of the Tile Splitter -> Death Fist combo. He is also one of the strongest 
fighter in the whole game.
     When playing against Heihachi, do not let your self be open. If you 
are open, good opponents would go for the Twin Pistons, and if the first 
one hit, the second one always hits, and you will be juggled. The 
Hellsweeps are a bit easier to defend against. If you are tripped on the 
first one, then there is nothing you can do. However, if you are not 
tripped, just block low for the next hell sweep(s). If you notice a pause 
after a hell sweep, then Heihachi is going for the finisher, which are all 
medium attacks. Block mid when you notice the pause to defend against 
those. Heihachi can finish the hell sweeps in a dragon upper, a rush upper, 
or axe kicks. 
     Heihachi also have 2 different version of Thrust Kick, a mid one and a
low one. Thrust Kick is a move where Heihachi does a little hop, and 
release a powerful kick. Most of the time, both CPU and human opponent 
tends to do the mid Thrust Kick, so either block or reverse it. However, I 
wanted to make sure that you know about the low version, and it's really 
hard to guess which one is coming. The best thing to do is to interrupt him 
on the hop. 
     Beware also of his Rising Sun (uf+4,4) and Hell's Axle (uf+3,4). 
Rising Sun looks like the first 2 of Jin's uf+4,4,4,4 combo. It hits high 
then low. Hell's Axle looks like Hwoarang's Hunting Hawk (uf+3,4,3) 
without the last hit. Hell's Axle has good damage.
     Another move that you have to watch out for is the Rushing Uppercut 
(f,f+2). This move will go under high attacks, and juggles you really high. 
When you see this move coming, counter it with df+1, or just block it. The 
Tile Splitter - Death Fist combo is only dangerous if the Tile Splitter is 
a counter hit, meaning the Death Fist will also connect. When you are hit 
by the Tile Splitter, just block and see if the Death Fist is blocked. If 
it is, use b+4 to knock him back. Both of Heihachi's special uppercut, the 
Dragon Upper and the Wind Godfist, hits mid, so you can't duck it. Both of 
them has a long recovery time, so punish him if you block those move. 
Remember that from the crouch dash (f,n,d,df), Heihachi can go into these 
uppercuts or the HellSweeps, so if Heihachi used the hell sweeps, defend 
accordingly.
     Heihachi's move are designed to be effective up close. Stay outside 
the range of these moves. When he tries to come closer, use df+1 to knock 
him down and ground trap him. If his moves knocks you back, use b+4 to 
knock him back. Most of Heihachi's moves have a recovery time. Use that to 
your advantage. Feel free to use 10-strings against Heihachi, but be 
careful if your opponent is a good player, and knows how to defend against 
the strings.
     Heihachi has 2 types of 10-strings that I know of. Here is a list:

df+3,2,2,4,4,1,4,1,2,1         -  MMMLLMHMMM
df+3,2,2,4,4,1,4,1,2,4         -  MMMLLMHMMM
df+3,2,2,4,4,1,2,1,2,1         -  MMMLLMMMMM
f,f,n,2,1,2,2,3,4,4,1,2,1      -  HHHHMMLHMH

The strings that started with df+3 can be interrupted in the 4th or 5th 
hit, which are low hellsweeps. Low counter them, and juggle away. If you 
missed, block mid for the rest of the strings, and you should be able to 
block the last hits. The other kind is similar to Jin's version of the 
string. Reverse the 6th hit. Don't forget to block low on the 7th hit.
     Heihachi is one powerful dude. If you can master both him and King, 
and maybe Nina, you could be unstoppable. 

vs Ogre I and II
----------------
     Ogre has too many moves. With so many moves in his arsenal, Ogre is a 
pain to play against. Not to mention that some of his moves are 
outrageously strong, to the point of being cheap. Even more, Ogre has the 
most unblockables in the game, except for Yoshi. Playing against Ogre is 
quite frustrating. Fortunately for most of us, CPU Ogre is easy to beat. 
Most of the time, the CPU sticks to just a few moves. Most of the time. 
Good Ogre player, on the other hand, is a lot better. 
     Ogre have some moves that you have to be aware of. First of all, 
beware of his Infinity Kicks. This is the cheapest move of all time, 
especially on Ogre. Not even Paul's Phoenix Smasher is this cheap. When 
Ogre throw this move at you, back away, and use b+4 or ali kicks to stop 
him. You can try to reverse it. Remember that the 1st 2 kicks are mid, and 
the 3rd are low, and this pattern is repeated over and over. Reverse/low 
counter properly. 
     Another move, or moves, that you should be aware of is Ogre's 
unblockables. Sometimes Ogre uses these to ground trap you, and that can 
be frustrating. Use lighting ankle kick to stop him. 
     Finally, watch out for his Bazooka Kick. This move will stun you if 
you are blocking, and he could either throw you or do some other stuff. 
Try to reverse it if you see it coming( although I'm not sure if you 
could ). If you can't, use d+1 to interrupt it.
     This following section will be devoted entirely to Ogre II's fire 
breath move. Ogre has 2 different fire breath, the standing Fire Breath 
(d+1+2) and the flying Fire Breath (1+2). When you see the standing Fire 
Breath coming, DUCK!! You will not be hit. When Ogre is done, go up to 
him and throw/juggle/string him. When you see the flying Fire Breath 
coming, start side stepping. The flying Fire does not seem to track. When 
he landed, throw him. The throw should be a side/back throw, since you 
side stepped.
     When playing against Ogre, be offensive. Don't let Ogre use his more 
dangerous moves. Use df+1 if he is close enough. Pressure him to death. Do 
NOT give him room. Use poking technique and 10-strings to pressure.
     Ogre has no known 10 strings.
     Ogre is a pain in the ass to play against, but he is beatable. 
Practice is the key.

vs Julia Chang
--------------
     Julia Chang has the potential to be a top 5 character. Her moves 
varies a lot in the hit level. On a bad note, she is hard to defend 
against.
     Julia's strength comes from the fact that her moves are hard to guess 
on. It could end in high or low attacks. She also have the best sweep
( d+4 ) in the game, and you could chain it into a low kick, a high kick, 
or an uppercut. When she goes into her kick combos( 4,4.. stuff ), block 
high for the first one, then low for the next, and guess for the next one. 
Block high initially to see which one your opponent prefers. If it is a 
high kick, use b+4 to hit her back. Juggle or throw her if it is an 
uppercut. If it is a low kick, move in and use df+1, or back away and hope 
that it is a high attack next time. Then see which one your opponent 
prefers, and adjust accordingly. You might want to let them hit you a 
couple of time to fool them.
     Another move you have to watch out for is her Sweep -> Bowleg combo. 
This combo could come up in different way. There's the 1+4,3 method, or 
the 1~1,4,3 method, or the D,df+4,3 method, or the df+1,4,3 method. 
Whichever method they uses, know that if you are hit by the Sweep, and 
you are close enough, the Bowleg will always hit. If you like playing 
defensively, stay out of the sweep range to avoid this move.
     Another move you have to watch out for is her Death Push -> Heaven 
Cannon combo. This could also come out in different ways. Death Push is 
the low right jab, and the Heaven Cannon is the left upper after Death 
Push that puts you up there. The damage is good, and you can't counter or 
reverse the Heaven Cannon. The Death Push is one sneaky move. Do not let 
them hit you with it.
     When playing against Julia, being offensive is a good idea. A good 
Julia player will mix it up, making it hard to play them. Use df+1 and 
other poking technique if they get too close. Julia has a fair amount of 
throw, so learn how to escape them. It's really hard to guess on a good 
Julia, so playing defensively has quite a risk.
     Here is a list of Julia's strings and its attack level:

2,1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,1           - HHMHHLHHLM
2,1,1,2,3,3,2,3,2,1           - HHMHHLMLMH
2,1,1,2,3,3,2,1,4,3           - HHMHHLMMLH

I haven't had enough experience against these strings, unfortunately. I 
think you could reverse the 5th hit, which are a high left kick. Or maybe 
you could low counter the 6th hit. It is best that you interrupt these 
strings early, because the last few hits of all of her strings varies in 
hit level.
     Julia are good in the right hand, but there aren't many of those 
around my place. There isn't a lot of Julia player in my arcade, so any 
additions or corrections to this guide in reference to her is greatly 
appreciated.

vs Gun Jack
-----------
     Imagine Kuma with a lot more moves. That would be Gun Jack. Gun Jack 
also have the ability to finish you up in less than 6 hit. However, he is 
slow as a snail, and can be downright predictable sometimes.
     When playing against Gun Jack, do not to lose your concentration. 
Always remember that when you are dashing back, you are vulnerable. Gun 
Jack love to use his Cross Cut Saw( f,f+1+2 ), and link it with either a 
low Cut Saw( d+1+2 ) or a Megaton Punch( df+2 ). If you got hit with the 
CC Saw when you are dashing back, it connects as a counter hit, and you 
will get hit by the link. Another move that Gun Jack uses a lot are the 
Cossack Kicks( db+3,4,3,4... ). If the 1st one is a counterhit, you will 
be hit by all 6. If you are able to block it, just do a low counter, and 
juggle away.
     Another move that Gun Jack have is the Liftoff Thrust( 3+4[3+4,3+4] ). 
This is a move where Gun Jack flies up and attempt to pounce you. If you 
are close enough, run up behind Gun Jack so you will face his back when 
he land, and back-throw his ass to death.
     Like Kuma, being offensive is not a good idea against Gun Jack. Use a 
defensive poking strategy and a lot of df+1 to pressure him. Juggle/throw 
whenever possible. Be careful when you are dashing back.
     Here is a list of Gun Jack's 10-strings:

d+2,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,1+2,1+2                - LLLMMHHHMH
d+2,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,d+1+2,1+2              - LLLMMHHHLM
uf+1,1,4,3,4,1,2,1,1+2,1+2               - MHLLLHHHHH
uf+1,1,4,3,4,1,2,1,d+1+2,1+2             - MHLLLHHHLM

If you see 3 low punch attacks coming, it could be the 10-strings. Low 
counter the 2nd or 3rd punch if you can. If not, guess where the 9th hit 
is going to hit, and block accordingly. If the strings starts with a 
jumping left punch, remember that the 3rd through 5th hit are low. Low 
counter them. If you can't, then you have to again guess where the 9th hit 
is going to hit, and block accordingly.
     Don't take Gun Jack lightly.

vs Mokujin
----------
     When playing Mokujin, adjust your gameplay to the character it 
imitates. You can tell which character it imitates by the opening round 
warm-up stance, but in latter rounds, it is much harder. Here's a list to 
help you with:

Ling     - both knees faces opponents, elbow angle is about 90 degree

Yoshi    - he has a sword.... DUH!!

Nina     - stands still, but arm is moving up and down all the time

Law      - arms moves wildly; think of Bruce Lee...

Hwoarang - hops up and down, arms close to waist

Eddy     - if you don't know... 

Paul     - can't really tell, but body seems to move very slowly...

King     - hops up and down( slower than hwoarang ), arms is held up

Lei      - little sidesteps, slight crouch

Jin      - can't tell right now

Bryan    - from 1p side, front body faces toward you, from 2p side, back 
           faces towards you; right arm is always held back

Kuma     - whole front face toward opponents, arms down, very noticeable...

Heihachi - can't really tell

Ogre     - I haven't seen Mokujin imitates Ogre

Julia    - arms set low and extended, both knee faces opponent

Gun Jack - almost like Ling, but right knee faces toward you

Paul, Jin, and Heihachi have style that is hard to tell apart. I suggest 
staying on the defensive until you figure out who it is...

**** "Mind Game" Strategy ****

     This section is devoted on how you can mentally frustrate your 
opponent using King's moves. Any help on this will be appreciated. Thanks 
to Sam for inspiring me to create this section.
     The simplest mind game you could play w/ your opponent is to make 
them guess which throw you are going to use. If you are able to do all 
of King's throw with ease, then this should be a cake walk. If the 
opponents started to duck, throw out crouching throws. Even better, throw 
out the crouching multi starter. To frustrate your opponent more, switch 
between in close poking and throws when you get into throw range.
     Another thing you can do to frustrate your opponent is by using the 
options you get from the crouch dash( f,n,d,df ). Start the crouch dash 
from about 3-4 characters away, because the crouch dash is pretty long. 
There are a few things King can do from a crouch dash. The first option 
you have is to jump back. Do this by pressing b when King is crouch 
dashing. Nothing is more frustrating to your opponent.
     Another thing you can do with off a crouch dash is one of King's WS 
moves. Do this by waiting after the crouch dash is finished, and pressing 
the right button when King is getting up. You can use 1, 2 and 4 for the 
button. All of King's WS moves hits mid, so opponents cannot block low.
     If the opponents are starting to adjust, then it's time to use the 
crouch dash multi starters. It will catch those opponents who block high. 
However, if the opponents happens to block low, you're toast. If you soften 
them up with the other tactics, this should work just fine. Use with care.
	Another thing you can do is the crouching knuckle bomb (f,n,d,df,n+1+2).
Use it when opponents are starting to duck your multistarters.
     One more thing, remember to adjust to your opponent style for maximum 
effect. Different players, different tactics.
     That is all I have for this section. If you have any thing to add, or 
you saw something that need some fixing, please e-mail your inputs to my 
e-mail address, which is mentioned above.
