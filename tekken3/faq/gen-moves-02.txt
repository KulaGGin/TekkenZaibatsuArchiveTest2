	New versions of this FAQ are available at my web site, which is
located at http://pw2.netcom.com/~surfbard/ . Please stop by and tell me
what you think of the site.

	If this is the first revision you've seen (or have seen in a while),
I HIGHLY recommend reading the Notations section... you'll be in the dark
without it!
	This is best printed in edit.com and best viewed in monospace format,
meaning use a font like Courier New.... or view from Notepad or edit.com!

	Rumors are flying, and no one knows how many characters will be in
Tekken 3. So far, 18 characters have been released in my arcade. I will only
post moves for characters that are absolutely CONFIRMED.

	If you have any moves or fixes for this FAQ, PLEASE e-mail me. Your
help is needed to complete the moves list!

	No part of this FAQ may be reproduced and sold for profit. After 
all, if I'm not making money off of this.... It may be redistributed ONLY 
in its entirety by electronic format for personal and/or recreational 
purposes. Please do not alter it in any way, shape, or form.

*Tekken 3 Basics - Explanations for the New General Maneuvers*

# Axis Shifting Sidestep (u,n -or- d,n)
The sidestep was a gift to a character in Tekken 2. In Tekken 3, every
character can now perform a sidestep. Mind you, sidestepping won't get you
out of many moves due to the fact that attacks automatically track (that is,
if you sidestep too early, your opponent will hit you anyway), but when
you use the correct timing, sidestepping is a great asset. Using sidesteps
to dodge the opponent's attack and then countering or initiating a juggle
is a major addition to Tekken 3's gameplay.

# Agression Charge (1+2+3+4)
The Agression Charge is another new addition to Tekken 3. Once the move is
used, your character will charge up for a moment (like the charge before
an unblockable attack), and their fists will begin to sparkle. Agression
Charges usually last about five seconds. During a charge, your character's
attacks will all be counted as counterattacks, so moves that do special things
when they hit on counterattack are most effective! Also, if your character's
attacks are blocked, they will still take off a small amount of damage (as
if the "Guard Damage" game option were turned on). Use the charge to your
advantage... do moves that normally take off alot of damage but are
frequently blocked.

# Reversal Counter (f+1+3 -or- f+2+4)
Now even more characters have reversal moves. What was once a minor threat
has grown. Using the reversal counter is a tricky affair... it wo4s best
when you KNOW that you are about to be reversed. Some reversal counters even 
do a small amount of damage! It is rumored that not all characters have 
reversal counters. The actual button combination for the Reversal Counter
depends on the limb that your opponent is grabbing... if you punch with your
right hand and your opponent reverses, the correct counter would be
f+2+4.

# Immediate Recovery (~1 or ~2 or ~3 or ~4 - after being knocked down)
One of the best (in my opinion) additions to Tekken 3 was the immediate
recovery. No more lying on the ground (unless you want to) after your
opponent pummels you! The only time immediate recovery doesn't wo4 is after
being thrown or stunned. Be warned, though... immediate recovery isn't
always a good thing, especially when you bounce right back to take another
hit. Be careful!

# Ankle Kick (d+4 - after being knocked down)
Another addition to the list of options that you have after your opponent
knocks you down. This move gives a quick low shot to the enemy. Useful
for getting out of tight jams!

*Arcade Secrets and Tricks*

# Special Outfits
As of this writing, there are three characters that can use additional
outfits by pressing "START" to select them instead of a punch or kick
button. These are:

  Jin Kazama   -- school uniform with pinstripe pants and a purple shirt (*)
  Forest Law   -- the classic yellow and black Tekken uniform
  Ling Xiaoyu  -- school uniform with miniskirt and white shirt (*)
  
  (*)  -- these can only be selected after Mokujin becomes fightable
	  
Also, additional characters can be used by pressing "START" on certain
basic characters:

  Nina Williams -- Anna Williams (*)
  Eddy Gordo    -- Tiger (**)

  (*)  -- these can only be selected after Bryan Fury becomes fightable
  (**) -- these can only be selected two weeks after Ogre II becomes playable

# Special Stages
As of this writing, there is one special stage that can be accessed.

  High School -- you can fight here when either Jin or Xiaoyu is selected
		with the start button as the challenger.

*Throw & Reversal Counters*

Tekken 3 sees a new era in 3D Fighting Games... an era in which you can
easily counter your opponent's attacks. This is a big step towards more
realistic fighting, obviously... and an interesting twist to classic
gameplay. While reversals and counters are tricky to learn and pull off
sometimes, this section will give you some ways in which to escape the most
damaging attacks in Tekken... throw and grapple techniques.

E - Escape
R - Reversal

*Tekken 3 Strategy*

What use is there to knowing the moves if you don't know when and how to
use them? The single most important thing in any fighting game, without a
doubt, is the strategy that you use to win. In this section, I will try to
touch upon the basic aspects of gameplay and strategy in Tekken 3, and then
move on to some basic character strategy.

-GENERAL-
  # Blocking
To say the least, blocking is rather important. Your opponent's attacks will
be rendered useless, you won't sustain damage, and you'll get a small
opening for a counterattack. Remember that attacks in three basic levels,
High, Middle, and Low. High attacks are generally the easiest to see coming.
They are easily blocked standing up, and can even be ducked under. Middle
attacks cannot be ducked under, but can also be blocked while standing up.
Low attacks can be blocked low or hopped over. Keep in mind that there are
unblockable attacks in the game, and that throws cannot be blocked!

  # Throwing
A valuable move in any character's arsenal. Once you have a hold on your
opponent, your character will perform some type of damaging close attack.
Throws can only be initiated while you are very close to your opponent,
otherwise your character will appear to be "grabbing air". Keep in mind
that throws can be countered, reversed, ducked, and dodged.

  # Juggling
Another aspect of Tekken 3's complex gameplay is the juggle system. Once
you get your character in the air (many moves do this, in my FAQ moves that
juggle your opponent are denoted by (NJ) after the move's name), you
can hit them using punches, kicks, and strings. A chain of moves that hits
your opponent once they are in the air is known as a "juggle combo". Juggle
Combos are very valuable because every single hit that connects while your
opponent is airborne is effectively unblockabe. My advice : try to get your
opponent in the air as much as you can, and learn a few different juggle
combos. Know your arsenal!

  # Countering
Countering, to make a long story short, is the act of attacking your
opponent while he/she is attacking you. This may be difficult at first, but
is essential to winning in Tekken 3. Attacks that connect on counterhit
even do more damage than normal! Try axis shifting before countering,
especially when you know that your opponent is performing a long, drawn
out combo that is difficult to break out of once started! Once you become
more comfortable with countering, you can start to use more of your
character's arsenal (some moves do certain things on counterhit, such as
juggle or stun). Add countering to reversing tactics, and you have a very
good way to play defensively.

  # Reversing
Reversing is similar to countering. When your opponent attacks, you can
perform a move that catches your opponent's arm or leg and gives a shattering
counterattack. Mind you, not all characters have reversals, but some
characters that don't have reversal moves have "combo breaking" moves
instead. Combo Breaks are moves that reverse an opponent's attack, but
don't do any damage. Reversals and Combo Breaks are very difficult to time
correctly at first. Don't get discouraged though... reversing is a VERY
important skill to learn.

-BRYAN FURY-

  # General
Bryan's greatest asset is the mix of numerous small strings (all composed of
three or four hits, ranging in attack levels) and powerful one-hitters.
Dazzle the opponent with quick, varied strings for a while and then blast
them with the power moves!

  # Quad Attack (3,2,1,2) - M,M,M,M
One of Bryan's many small strings, this string is a variation on Bruce's
old Gatling Attack (3,2,1,4) combo, which hit M,M,M,L. I suggest, if
you liked the Gatling Attack combo, do it a few times during the match,
and then use the Quad Attack... the hard swipe at the end is almost a sure
hit (unless the opponent never blocked the low hit at the end of the Gatling
Attack combo, which you should be wary of).

  # Straight Fist (f,F+2) - H
One of Bryan's power move arsenal, the Straight Fist blasts the opponent
away quickly and efficiently. It is very powerful for what it is, and is
best executed after a small string (like the Quad Attack or Southern Cross).

  # Double Punishment (qcf+2,B+2) - M,!
This can only be completed if the Gutpunch (qcf+2) connects... but the
results on completion are monstrous. Not only does it look cool (Bryan
laughs like a madman during the second hit as well), but it does a ton of
damage and can be followed up with a juggle! The best thing to do here is
the Spinning Punches -> Spinkick (B+2,1,4) combo... all it takes is the
Gutpunch to connect and the opponent suffers a good 80+% damage!

  # Phantom's Claw (ss,1~2) - M
Another powerful addition to Bryan's arsenal, the Phantom's Claw is a rapid
fake-out version of the Straight Fist... and it comes off of a sidestep!
Think of the look on your opponent's face when he/she is pummeled out of
a string from the side... savor that...

-EDDY GORDO-

  # Vault Sweep (3~4) - L
The Vault Sweep is one of Eddy's most important moves. It hits low twice,
can be linked to the Hanstand Position, Rolling Kicks Combo, Crying Needle,
Grounded Position... possibilities are endless. Keep in mind that the Vault
Sweep takes some time to get off, and should be used from about two steps
away.

  # Flapjack Kick (3+4) - M
The Flapjack Kick is a good move to follow up the Aggression Charge with.
It does good damage, and hits from above. However, the best part about this
move is that it can be used to fake out the opponent for a quick trip to
Hanstand Position! Holding back after initiating the move will start Eddy
into the move, and just before he hits the opponent, his legs split and
he breaks into the Handstand Position. This should be used in moderation,
though... and don't overuse either the kick itself or the fakeout.

  # Arching Crescent (b+4) - H
Although the Arching Crescent can be easily ducked or avoided, its main
value lies in its chaining ability. It can be chained to two flip kicks or
a long, low sweep combo. Try mixing it up a little... it's easy to forget
one move when you only do the other!

  # Handstand Position (f+3) - M
One of Eddy's secondary attack modes. From here, Eddy has a whole slew
of moves in his arsenal, from the Vault Sweep (this can be used for infinite
strings... Vault Sweep, Rolling Kick Combo, Handstand Position, Handstand
Kick, Vault Sweep, etc...), the Rollout Punch (and all the combos that go
with it), Grounded Position, Inferno Kick... Also, don't forget that Eddy
can move and dodge while in Handstand Position.

  # Grounded Position (ss,3) - L
Grounded Position is accessible after some moves by holding down, and is
signified by Eddy holding his head up before lying down. This only lasts
a second or two, so use one of his sweeps fast, then link to a spinning kick
to get back into Handstand Position.

-GUN JACK-

  # General
Gun Jack's biggest advantage is in the sheer power of his moves. One of the
slowest characters in the game (if not the slowest), Gun Jack absolutely
needs this power to survive. Use his stronger moves as much as possible
without leaving yourself open!

  # Reverse Mega Hammer Strike (d+1+2) - H
This is one of Gun Jack's strongest blockable hits... and puts the opponent
up for a low juggle. Follow it up with a Double Hammer Strike (1+2,1+2)
for a quick, easy, insanely damaging combo. Note the time that it takes
for Jack to wind up for the move, though... take into account that the
opponent can easily duck and counter.

  # Jack Hammer (1,1,1) - H,H,M
Just what the opponent needs to get ahead... two slow-as-mud swipes that
hit high. Be wary of the ducking opponent, and steer clear of using this
string at all!

  # Windmill Punches -> Left Power Swipe (D,df+1,2,1,1) - M,M,M,H
These come off quick, provided you can get away with the crouch first.
The swipe at the end does alot of damage and stuns if blocked, but has a
nasty recovery time and can be ducked. My advice is to abort the swipe (1)
at the end and go for a Double Hammer Strike (1+2,1+2) if possible!

  # Cross Cut Saw (f,f+1+2) - M
Quick, powerful, and comes off a dash (try buffering...)! One of the nicer
parts of this move is that it can be followed up with a Low Cross Cut Saw
(1+2) or a Megaton Punch (df+2) to make a string... one hits M,L and the
other M,M... try mixing it up. The Megaton Punch takes longer to execute,
so the experienced player (knowing this) will block the first hit, then
crouch. The Low Cross Cut Saw would be blocked, but you go for a Megaton
Punch... and the opponent realizes that the Low Cross Cut Saw won't come out
because of the delay. The opponent then blocks high. Be wary of this...
if it happens once, don't use the Cross Cut Saw again.

-HEIHACHI MISHIMA-

  # General
Heihachi, without a doubt, is the most powerful character in the game
because of his unfair blend of speed, power, and juggle combos. However,
it is still very easy to lose with him due to the balanced nature of the
game. Keep this in mind, and don't lower your defense for a second!

  # Wind Godfist (f,n,d,df+2) - M
Yes, friends, the Wind Godfist is back (sorry Jin players)! Heihachi's
hits middle level, and juggles every time. It can be delayed incredibly
long, because it can be executed any time during the crouch dash (I suggest
reading Slikatel's articles on dash buffering and delays at TWP). Look at
Heihachi's juggle selection under (NJ) for a list of the crushing follow-up
possibilities!

  # Chi Fists (1+2) - M
The only thing that could possibly make Heihachi more formidable than
he was in Tekken 2 would be the addition of a quick, almost invisible attack.
He got it. Also try the Delayed Chi Fists (f+2~1+2) for added enjoyment.
Sidestepping during a tenstring or other non-tracking string and then using
the lightning-fast attack is another highlight. As always, don't overuse ;
there are plenty more crushing attacks in Heihachi's arsenal!

  # Twin Pistons (df+1,2) - M,M
As dangerous as ever, the Twin Pistons remain high on Heihachi's priority
list because of the time it takes to execute the first hit... virtually
none. Both uppercuts hit middle level, and the second uppercut floats the
opponent for a (BL) juggle... just Twin Piston again for some easy damage.
This is an ideal minor counter move (or major counter for that matter, but
it is riskier).

  # Hell Sweeps (f,n,d,DF+4,4,4) - L,L,L
The most sickening thing to the opponent about the Hell Sweeps as that
they can branch off into five different attack routes after any of the
three sweeps. You can use a Dragon Punch (1), a Rushing Uppercut (2),
Tsunami Kicks (n,4~4), another Hell Sweep (4) or juggle (n,4 usually).
All five hit middle level, which is extremely dangerous for the blocker.
Mix your attacks up... never use a mid-level move after the same number
of Hell Sweeps twice!

-HWOARANG-

  # General
As always, and now more than ever, my advice to you... mix it up. Know
everything in Hwoarang's arsenal, and don't let up for a second. Use
all of his stances. Use tenstrings (or fragments of them) frequently.
Don't let up for a second.

  # Leg Switch (3+4) - N/A
In my opinion, the Leg Switch is useless unless you know which leg is 
forward (DON'T LOOK! It takes too long, leaving you open.). Hwoarang's
best combos can be done regardless of what stance he's in (or with his
left leg forward, which is the default usually).

  # Bird Hunter (d+4,4) - L,H
This is one of Hwoarang's easiest jugglers. It changes attack levels, too...
for some reason, some find it difficult to block! Knock the opponent up
in the air for a good four- or five-kick volley.

  # Hunting Hawk (uf+3,4,3) - H,J,J
Provided you can get the first hit off, this is a damaging and fun-to-watch
combo. Provided you can get the first hit off. If the first hit is blocked,
only the second hit comes out, not the third... two hits, easy to reverse.
Only use once or twice a round... at the most.

-JIN KAZAMA-

  # General
Jin, keeping in the Mishima juggle tradition, can hold his own, without a
doubt. Alot of his moves have been toned down or are harder to use (?) than
Kazuya's, but let's keep this in perspective.... Kazuya was a boss in Tekken
2. The key here is still in the juggles and unorthodox stun punch combos.
Keep going at the opponent, and don't forget that Jin has reversals.

  # Tsunami Kick ([WS]4,4) - M,M
Nothing is more annoying than knowing that Jin can pop up for a double hit
after a crouch. Effective after going down with a d+1 to counter, Jin's
Tsunami Kick is a great weapon. Nonetheless, this one should only be used
while close, since it leaves Jin quite open.

  # Demon Scissors (4~3) - M
The one good use for this move is as a follow-up for juggle combos.
Otherwise, it's useless because of the time it takes to execute.

  # Demon Godfist (b,f+2) - M
This one only stuns on counterhit... risky business for some. It is,
however, a vital move if you want to start a good, damaging combo. It
can be followed up with almost anything, so keep a few combos in mind before
you start... split-seconds count.

  # Wind Godfist (f,n,d,df+2) - H
Contrary to popular belief, the WGF is still one of the best, most efficient
ways to start a juggle combo. It only juggles on counterhit, though...
otherwise, it knocks your opponent too far away for you to do anything
useful.

  # Rising Sun -> Hell Sweep -> Roundhouse (uf,n,4,4,4,4) - H,L,L,H
Annoying at best. Remember that this pre-canned combo tracks, so don't
abandon it if your opponent steps (or rolls) out of the way. Be wary,
though, about using this move against a character that has reversals.
A skilled opponent will put you down in no time. To be safe, get ready
with the right limb reversal counter (f+2+4).

-JULIA CHANG-

  # General
Julia's greatest strength lies in the variety of her strings. The key here
is to keep at it, and never use the same combo more than twice! Her
best throw, in my opinion, is the Cyclone Suplex (D,db,D,db+1+2) because
it is difficult to escape. The only bad point to it is that it is sometimes
difficult to pull off (especially for new players). Try sidestepping before
starting some of her strings... that should increase your chances of hitting.

  # Cannon Blast ((WS)2 or 3~2) - M
This move is very important for starting Julia's multiple strings. Some
strings to try are (WS)2,1,1 (which juggles... tack on a d+4,1 for
quick damage), and (WS)2,1,4,3 (the Cannon Blast linked to the Buffalo
Arrow Combo). There are many other possibilities as well... some come
of quicker than others (check the moveslist!). The only down side to the
Cannon Blast is the time it takes to come out and the recovery time, one
of the worst in her arsenal.

  # Buffalo Arrow Combo (df+1,4,3) - M,L,H
This one is slow, but varies in attack level. I suggest using it every so
often, but don't make it a habit. It can come off of a Cannon Blast, making 
it a little less predictable.

  # Cyclone Suplex (D,db,d,DB+1+2) - Throw
This throw is superior to all of Julia's other throws because it is simply
the most difficult to escape. As opposed to the easier throws (which are
broken by tapping 1 or 2 at the right time, see the Throw Escapes section
for details), this throw is broken with 1+2. The animation is pretty cool,
too.

      a spinkick, and then ends in a winning stance.
  -3 ???
  -4 Bends backwards, laughs, and motions to his opponent, "bring it on!"

* Eddy Gordo 
  -1 Here Eddy starts out by doing his normal dancing fighting stance, 
      does a spin as he then goes back to his stance and is laughing. 
  -2 For this one he starts with a head spin, goes into a break dancing 
      backspin move, and ends up in his normal dancing stance again. 
  -3 Eddy does his 2 footed arial assault into some type of taunting laugh. 
  -4 For his final win stance, he goes from a cartwheel directly into a 
      flip, then back to his fighting stance.

* Gun Jack
  -1 In this sequence, Gun Jack bends his arms as if he is shooting an
      arrow, and then turns and does it on the other side.
  -2 Here Gun Jack puts out his arms and lifts off into the sky.
  -3 In this classic sequence, Gun Jack rapidly beats his stomach with his
      fists, subsequentially falling down due to lack of AI. Honestly, you'd
      think that this problem would have been corrected after 19 years of
      technological advancement! :)
  -4 In this sequence, Gun Jack poses with his right arm bent, and then
      steps forward and flails his arms toward the sky.

* Heihachi Mishima
  -1 Heihachi does a double pose with two long blocking stances.
  -2 Here, Heihachi stomps on the ground, squaring off with lightning
      engulfing him.
  -3 He thrusts his arm down below his knees, lightning sparking from his
      lowered hand.
  -4 He bends down into a crouch, with his legs bent under him, then crosses
      his arms.

* Hwoarang 
  -1 In this stance, it starts with him doing an upward kick and then 
      into 2 powerful spinning round houses. 
  -2 He starts this out by doing some type of fighting stance where his 
      arms almost in a circular shape by his head. Then he goes into a low 
      kick and a spin and ends it off with that same stance again. 
  -3 This one is done very quickly. He first turns his back toward the 
      camera, crosses his arms and will eventually end up in a totem pole 
      like stance with his hands in the air. 
  -4 Here Hwoarang does 3 jabs, goes into the same stance as the first 
      one, crosses his arms and then raises and extends his right arm 
      forward. 

* Jin Kazama 
  -1 Jin does a quick 4 punch combo into a defensive fighting stance. 
  -2 Jin displays his skills by doing a 3 hit 1,1,2 combo if front of the 
      camera. 
  -3 Jin shows his true Mishima roots by imitating the Devil Kazuya stance 
      from Tekken 2 where he stands straight up with his arms folded and as 
      the camera zooms in he looks away. 
  -4 Here Jin does a small uppercut and then comes back with a leaping one 
      directly toward the camera.

* Julia Chang
  -1 Here Julia does a forward flip and puts her hands on her hips.
  -2 Here Julia jumps off to the side, gets down on one knee, and puts
      her hands together as if she was in prayer.

      Tekken 2. 
  -2 King simply does a left backfist into a downward slash as he growls. 
  -3 For this one, King raises his fist 3 times kind of like "Three cheers 
      for King!!" 
  -4 King drops his arms as he looks up and growls at the moon.

* Kuma / Panda
  -1 Here the bear mocks her nemesis Paul Phoenix by imitating Paul's
      "Cop a squat" win stance.
  -2 Classic Tekken 2 Kuma where she walks around waving her hands in
      the air.
  -3 The bear continues her theiving ways by stealing Marshall Law's old
      school pose from Tekken 1. Here she rises up and leans back throwing
      her hands above her head.
  -4 This one is by far the funiest one of them all. After finishing
      off her opponent, Kuma does her newer dancing bear routine.

* Forest Law 
  -1 Here Forest square's off his body as he brings his arms in and 
      concentrates his chi energy. 
  -2 He starts this one by going into a chi concentration and now that he 
      is ready for combat he then moves into his fighting stance. 
  -3 This is one of his more active win stances where it starts by him 
      doing 2 spinning round houses and then going into 2 jabs. 
  -4 For this pose, Law does 2 jabs then rises his right leg slowly from 
      forward to back and then holds it there showing off his balance and 
      skills as a fighter. 

* Lei Wulong 
  -1 Here Lei starts out by doing his own rendition of his of a Can-Can 
      kicks, does 5 punches and then ends up in his Lion stance (I think...). 
  -2 Lei does a simple pose with both his arms extended in the air. 
  -3 Lei shifts back and does his drunken dance a la Tekken 2. 
  -4 Lei completes 4 stance changes as he displays his versatility as a 
      fighter. 

* Nina Williams 
  -1 Nina uses her slutty walk to move toward you, do a backhand swipe, 
      and then laugh. 
  -2 In this one, she does a forward cartwheel into her trademark backhand 
      swipe. 
  -3 Nina does spins in a circle and instead of a backhand swipe, we see a 
      downward slash. 
  -4 This stance starts out with her now trademarked backhand swipe into 
      her deviant laugh.

* Ogre I
  -1 Flies toward the camera, chanting.
  -2 Raises his hand in the air, chanting.
  -3 ???
  -4 ???

* Ogre II
  -1 Flies toward the camera, chanting.
  -2 Raises his hand in the air, chanting.
  -3 ???
  -4 ???

* Paul Phoenix 
  -1 For this one, Paul brushes his hands off 3 times like he just took 
      out the trash and then raises his right arm in the air as a symbol of 
      victory. 
  -2 Paul starts off by dropping a devastating hammer punch into some form 
      of deep concentration. 
  -3 Paul simply does 3 salutes to show off his patronage. 
  -4 Here Paul squats down while looking at his opponent and starts 
      taunting them. 

* Ling Xiaoyu 
  -1 This is the one that I see all the time. It is her handstand into 
      the splits (reminds me of Chun Li) then she falls back down onto her 
      knees. 
  -2 Here she calmly folds her hands together and bows to her opponent 
      similar to a Chinese greeting. 
  -3 Ling apparently has the happy feet in this win stance as she very 
      enthusiastically hops around flailing her arms showing off her 
      fighting skills. 
  -4 Ling waves her arms in a circular motions and then gets into a 
      defensive stance ready to take out her next victim. 

* Yoshimitsu 
  -1 Here Yoshimitsu draws his sword and waves it back and forth as he 
      then pulls it back and is ready to strike. 
  -2 Yoshimitsu does a back flip into his sit down stance as he then 
      draws his draws his sword and holds it in front of him. 
  -3 This Stance begins by him doing his forward double somersault then 
      ends with him drawing his sword and is ready to strike. 
  -4 Ahh...the classic Tekken 1 win stance where bends his knee and hops 
      on one leg, then wiggles his head back and forth and goes into a stiff 
      arm motion.
