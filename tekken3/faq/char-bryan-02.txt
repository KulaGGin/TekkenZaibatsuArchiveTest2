 :: BRYAN FURY Strategy Guide 0.1::            by Pablo Gallego
 -================================-        (pablo_gallego@yahoo.com)


 


   First of all, please forgive my English. I'm Spanish and the FAQ may have
some lack of expression. You could take this as a way of getting into the
character :). 

  Bryan Fury is one of the most damaging characters in Tekken3. Jack's moves 
are slow and King's multithrows easy to avoid. Bryan's main drawback is his
lack of low attacks. An opponent can just stand and wait without being damaged. 
This can be avoided using throws or using his lowkicks often. The high 
priority of many of Bryan's moves will do the rest. So, when your opponent
starts attacking it is your time to kill him in four or five hits 
(It's possible to finish the enemy in just two combos and I'm close to find 
the more than 140 string). This means that your opponent can make very few 
mistakes if he wants to live.
  
  
   MOVES:
  
  Now I'm going to comment every Bryan move. If you want a list of each move's
height and damage, as well as a lot of information about Tekken3 I recommend
you to read Ben Cureton's Tekken 3 Manual. You can find it at www.gamefaqs.com.

 
   1,2,1,2
   1,2,1,4
   3,2,1,2
   3,2,1,4
   b+3,2,1,2
   b+3,2,1,4

  The left punch start is faster than the others, but it is high and it
makes the third hit blockable. Use this version only for countering.
  The kick start is slower, but hits mid and has a better range. If you
hit with it in counter the next opportunity to block for your opponent will 
be the [2_4] (and it's a mid_low guessing game). 
  The b+3 version has both drawbacks: it's high and slow. However you can
start Bryan's tenstrings from it (b+3,4...) and the second hit (4) is
unreversable.
  All strings are dangerous to finish with the punch. If it is blocked
your opponent will have a chance to throw you or something worse.
 

   1,2,3

  If you must use the punch start, you can follow with this to avoid the 
block in the third hit. However, the low kick is nearly as slow as if you 
did it out of string.


   1~4,2,1
   1~4,2,1
   1~4,2,1
   1~4,2,1
   1~4,2,4
   1~4,3,3

  Two fast high hits followed by either the backfist string or the 3,3. The
backfists are not a good idea; they're high, slow, and even if you hit with 
the first the second won't. If you like them, use only the 2,4 version.
  The 1~4,3,3 however, is a very good string. The two high hits are really
fast, and if the third hits, the fourth is assured for 61 damage.
  Two more things. First, if your opponent blocks the third hit don't follow 
with the fourth because you won't hit him in any case and if he crouches
under it you will feel some pain. Second, if you hit with the entire string
don't let your guard down because it won't knock down your opponent.


   3,3

  Much worse than "3,2...". Don't use this unless you need the extended
range.


   1+2

  A defensive move. Sways under high attacks and throws, then follows with
an uppercut and a high punch. Not very good damage, but avoids any throw,
even low ones, and stops many poking enemies as it throws them to the ground
with the second hit allowing you time to breathe.


   f+4,3,4

  It's not very good: if the first attack hits as a counter only the last
hit will connect as a juggle, it's slow, and your opponent will be able
to block every move. However, Bryan walks a step with each hit so use if you
need to close the distance a little. Also, if you use the entire string as
a juggle, all hits will usually connect.


   f+1+2

  This move is unreversable, but high, really slow, risky and deals poor
damage. You could use is as a substitute for f,f+2 when playing against
a reversal character. However, I'd recomend you to use the f,f+2 and buffer
a chicken instead.


   f,f+2

  Overused in bad moments and underused in good ones. This power punch hits
high, so you can't use as carelessly as you would with Paul's or Jin's.
But is a superb move for countering, especially minor countering. You can
answer with this move whenever you block an attack unless it has a really
fast recovery. You can also use it to stop a running opponent or to counter
a rushing string.
  This is a good move when facing a reversal character. Just keep pressed the
second F, then tap 2+4 to avoid any reversal attempt. 
  If you hit with this move you can try a full front dash followed by a
d/f+3 as okizeme.


   f,f+3

  One of old Bruce's moves. It's almost impossible to sidestep and if blocked
it will let you block your opponent's retaliation or even attack. It's slow
and it doesn't do extra damage if it counterhits so don't try to. Use as
okizeme against people who always stand with an attack. If you counterhit
with it you can follow with a running charge.


   f,f,f+3

  What can I say. You must know the use of this move if you are a Tekken 
player. If you are used to Tekken 2 be careful with a sidestep throw.
In Bryan's case this move deals enough guard stun to tack a f,f+2 as a
guaranteed hit, but the timing has to be very precise.
  Also remember that running side kicks are unreversable in Tekken 3.



   D/F+1(,1,1,1),2
   d/f+2

  Use the first one only if you want to follow with the right punch as it
stuns if blocked. These are the "fast" mid attacks for Bryan so you'll have
to use them to avoid crouching turtles.


   d/f+3
   
  One of the few low hits Bryan has. It's very slow, but crouches under high
attacks and has a very good range. It recovers crouching so if you hit follow
with WS+3,d+4,d/f+3 for between 42 and 62 damage. If it's blocked use any
WS move; WS+3 is still the best as your opponent will probably try to minor
counter and you can do a lot of damage (114 is enough for you?).


   d/f+4

  For playing effects it's similar to the f,f+3 but with less range. The
follow up with d/f+3 if almost assured and gives a total damage of 43. The
strange timing of the kick makes it useful against countering.



   d+3
   d+4

  Bryan doesn't crouch, he just does a standing lowkick. The d+3 is slower
with longer range; the d+4 is faster and shorter. Use the d+4 for okizeme
as it hits even a lying opponent if you aim at his/her knee.
  You will have to use these moves because of Bryan's lack of low attacks
so get used to their exact range and speed.


   d+3+4

  Another low hit for Bryan. Just like d+3 but he steps back after the kick,
use this if you want to keep the mid distance.


   d,d/f,f

  Bryan's crouch dash can't be followed with any special move, but it lets
Bryan in WS after aproaching to his opponent. From here you have many
options.
 - WS+
      1 : Short range for 60 damage.
      2 : Slow for 91 damage.
      3 : Fast with good range for up to 114 on counter.
      4 : Faster with better range for a simple kick.
  All these are mid, so mix with lowkicks for umpredictability. You can't
perform throws, but as you are already crouched you can try d,d/f,d,d/f+1+2,
a wonderful throw that does 45 damage.
  If your dash is being countered with low kicks, a good option is u/f+3
or the u/f,4 upward kick.


   d,d/b,b,2

  There are two uses for this move. First, you can backdash to evade an
attack and then hit with 2 in minor counter to start a juggle for 51 damage
(d,d/b,b,2,2,f,f+2) or an easier 46 with (1~4,3,3). The other use is to just 
backdash and then follow with a mid hit (3, u/f+3, d/f+3 or d/f+1) to
surprise your opponent. Use the second way if you backdash and the attack
doesn't come.


   b+2<1
   b+2<1,[u_d]
   b+2<1,2
   b+2<1,4
   b+2,4

  The backfists are one of the most damaging of Bryan's attacks. But they
start high and then follow high and usually finish high, which, generally
speaking, isn't a good thing. The turning kick can be seen a mile off and
if someone crouches the first punch you are dead.
  However, it has it's goodies. The first punch stuns on counter and lets
you follow with all the string (unlike the 1~4,2...). The second one stuns
always, and you can throw it directly if you press b+2,f+1,...
You can sidestep before hitting with the second punch, but it can't be
followed with a SS move.
  If you stun you can stop the string and start it again for a max of 83
damage with b+2,1,b+2,1,4. Very hard against a good player but with this
damage it's worth the try.
  This is the best juggle for Bryan after a high juggle starter.


   b+4

  Use this instead of d/f+[1_2] uppercuts against a reversal character.


   b,b+4

  More useful than it seems. It hits high and it's slow, but it's really
safe (can't be reversed or minor countered and it's hard to major counter),
stuns if blocked and it has good range and damage.
  Use it when your opponent is far away and doing something like charging 
up or changing stances. Use it also to avoid a charge, a rushing string or 
anything dangerous. 
  It leaves you on the ground so be careful against a good okizemer.


   u/f+3

  Good range but it's a very high mid (it won't hit a standing Gon). Use 
it to close distance fast and attacking.


   u/f+4

  A bad move by itself, but it causes a good bouncing juggle. Follow with 
f+2,f+4,3,4 for 62 damage. Or, if you weren't prepared for a fast juggle, 
just d+3,d+3,d/f+3 will do.


   u/f,4
   
  This is the classical jump juggling kick, but in Bryan's case, it's
potential damage makes it very powerful. Use to jump over a low attack 
and follow with b+2,1,4 for 71 damage.
   
   
   WS+1

  Followed by f+2,b+2,1,4 will deal a guaranteed 60 damage. Good after
d+1, d+2 or the crouch dash.


   WS+2,f+2
  
  Here begins the hard fighting. Follow with b+2,1,4 for 91 guaranteed damage
or a much easier 1~4,3,3 for 68 also guaranteed. To crouch use d+1, d+2 or
crouch dash.


   WS+3,4

  Another two-thirds-of-the-life-bar-off string. 
  Don't use the second move; just stun with the first as counterhit and
follow with a hard to pull out u/f,4,b+2,1,4 for 96 guaranteed damage, or an 
easier b+2,1,b+2,1,4 for 114 damage. However, in the second string, opponent 
can crouch under the second backfist. 
  If the b+2 is delayed a second it will juggle the opponent making him 
unable to block but with less damage (,,b+2,1,4 for 69).

  
   WS 1+2
   WS 4
   WS 3+4

  Knowing the other chances you should not think about these moves. Maybe you
could use the WS+4 for speed and range. 

   SS,1
   SS,2
   SS,1,2

  The first and second are fast but high. You can use a throw to grab a 
blocking opponent or SS,d/f+2 to hit a crouching one. But there is a much 
better way. 
  Press 2 after having started the SS,1 to change the left head hunter to
an uppercut that will stun your opponent as a counterhit. Follow as you
would the WS+3 for up to 138 damage! (can be crouched under at one point,
though). 

   f+1+3
   b+1+3

  Bryan's are two of the best unblockables of the entire game. Since he is 
able to deal 90 damage with an easy string his unblockables couldn't be the 
typical slow power moves (more than 140 damage is rarely useful). Instead,
Bryan's unblockables are fast and unreversable.
  You can use the f+1+3 whenever you want; it's very fast and crouches under 
high attacks. It's only drawback is that it doesn't do much damage. Bryan 
motion for both the unblockables is nearly the same, so when you want to 
use the more painful one your opponent won't probably see the difference 
until it's too late. 
  Both are good for okizeme, but your opponent has to be standing or moving 
from the ground. Try any of them after a SS; if your opponent was prepared 
to block a punch he may be surprised.


   [d_d/b]+[1+3_2+4]

  Useful against Eddy Gordo, or any predictable player. If you know 
tenstrings by heart you can stop them but I still like to wait a high 
attack to crouch and hit back. Anyway, I miss the low parry whenever
I play with a character that hasn't it.

                   4
   b+3,4,1,2,1,4,2,1,4,2
                 3,3

  The tenstrings. Not even a low hit, so your opponent just has to stand and 
wait to kill you. Even if he is stupid or hasn't ever fight against Bryan 
the damage will not go over 80 or 90 so just don't use them or use the 3,3
finish; that at least will leave you far from him.

   1+3+4

  The taunt. In my opinion, much better while the red bar catches up with 
the yellow one after a 90+ damage combo. :)

  
   
   STRATEGY:
  
  
  Bryan is one of the best characters against button mashers, but when his
opponent starts thinking he is severely stopped. I write this section for 
matches against average to good players (Don't use Bryan against a Master, 
his weaknesses can be easily used by anyone who knows how to).
  Anyway, Bryan is a character to play for fun, and the best for releasing
adrenaline. So if you use him rarely because you're stopped with easy
techniques, maybe reading this will help you to know how it feels to trample
someone in three seconds.

  An advantage for Bryan is that he can be played by reflexes. He hasn't long 
tricky strings or choice of heights or even multis, so you can fight without 
thinking about anything but to cach your opponent with a killer combo (try to
play a whole round performing an endless Lei string to know what I'm talking 
about).
  First step is to make your opponent forget you are playing with Bryan. If
your opponent does, he will be surprised of how fast his lifebar was finished.
If not you may be in trouble.  
  As I've already said, most of Bryan's moves moves are high or mid. This 
makes him very vulnerable to reversals and turtling technics. To avoid
reversals you'll have to master the chickens (sounds weird :) ), and use your
unreversable moves more often. (The chicken rules are very well explained in
Ben Curetons Tekken 3 Manual). 
  Turtling players can also become a problem as they can stop your attacks 
and answer with some fast and random heighted hits that will down your 
lifebar. To fight this you should use your lowkicks, but you will also need
to change the style of combat. Don't just answer to your opponent attacks 
with a lowkick and then wait for his next move. The lowkick has a good 
recovery time but not good damage, so use it (no matter if you actually 
damage your opponent as long as you hit him), and then follow it with a 
fast string. If your opponent answered with an attack you will probably 
counter his move, and if he stays blocking he may think your next move is 
also low.
  For example: d+3 for closing distance, d+1 that will only hit in counter as
it's special middle, WS+3 (even better if d+1 has been blocked). If the knee
counters the damage should be 96 (assuming you want to be sure, else it can be
up to 114). If it doesn't counter he won't be so sure of his turtling 
technique anyway.

  Another "advanced" way of fighting is the poking technique. Bryan is not 
very good at it (al least compared to Yoshi, King or Nina), but he can stop 
it. The way to do so is a gradual change of the moves from faster ones to 
slower and more powerful. Start by stopping your opponent with a d+any hit 
at the right moment, then follow with a d/f+2 if you started with a lowkick 
or WS+3 in the case of a crouching punch. Any of these will surely stop an 
attack or give you more room if blocked (the WS+3 could even counterhit for 
a 96 guaranteed damage). Then, you are at a distance where poking is not 
possible and it's time to avoid a new assault.
  Any long move like f,f+3 or b,b+4 or a string that starts with a long range 
attack can change your opponent's point of view over fight and changing it 
to an exchange of long distance attacks which Bryan can win.
