= ::::::::::::::::::::::::: BASE STORY OF TEKKEN 3 ::::::::::::::::::::::::: =
==============================================================================

The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 draws to a close. Jun Kazama comes to the
stunning realization that Kazuya's supernatural strength stems from Devil. But
she cannot help being drawn to him, propelled by a mystic force beyond her
control.

Several days later, the final challenger arrives to face Kazuya, the organizer
of the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2. In a reprise of the first Tekken
Tournament, the father and son clash in a cursed blood battle.

Eventually, Heihachi emerges scarred but victorious to regain control of the
immense Mishima Conglomerate. Unaware of Devil's presence, Heihachi casts the
lifeless Kazuya into a fiery volcano.

As Kazuya's body burns, Devil appears before the pregnant Jun Kazama in a bid
to enter the soul of the new life beating within her. But in a desperate
struggle for the future of her child, Jun defeats Devil and retires to
desolate Yakushima so as to raise Kazuya's son, Jin, alone.

Having regained control of the Mishima Conglomerate, Heihachi sets about to
further increase his powers. He embarks on a crusade to win the trust of world
leaders by putting wars and conflicts to rest.  Using his immeasurable wealth,
he forms Tekkenshu, a mercenary group employed to quell conflicts efficiently.
He also takes strong interest in the well-being of developing nations by
helping them build agricultural systems that will sustain them.

Through Heihachi's efforts, the world appears to be regaining peace.

Around fifteen years have passed, Jin Kazama is 15 years old now.

Under Heihachi's orders, the Tekkenshu are excavating a Central American
archeological site when they discover a mysterious life form.

Heihachi orders the creature's capture, but loses contact with the Tekkenshu
after a garbled radio message, "... they are all dead... Toshin
(Fighting God)?!..."

Upon arriving at the dig, Heihachi finds a field of corpses. Heihachi is
wracked by sorrow, but also realizes "the power of the mysterious life form
could be the key to my long dormant dream of world domination." To obtain
Toshin, and moreover, the world, Heihachi tempts the fates once again...

Within weeks, strange disappearances occur throughout the world. Persons of
strong soul, masters of martial arts and other derivative fighting disciplines
are reported missing... with no knowledge of their whereabouts.

Jun Kazama instinctively picks up on the dark power encroaching on her life.

She has no understanding of what it is, but senses that she has become a
target. Accepting her destiny, she tells Jin everything she knows of their
haunted past to prepare him for the fateful day she now feels is imminent.
Among her instructions, one is for Jin to go to his grandfather Heihachi if
anything happens to her.

Her intuition proves right on a cold, stormy night. Toshin comes to the
mountains bringing a chilling, swirling wind. "Run away!" cries Jun, Jin opts
to face Toshin against his mother's pleas and is knocked unconscious.

When Jin awakens, the house and everything around it is burned to the ground.
Searching frantically for his mother she is nowhere to be found.

Jun dies at Toshin's hands. Honoring her instructions, Jin goes to Heihachi
and begs to be trained to exact revenge.

Heihachi, hearing Jin's tale, is convinced that Toshin is after the souls of
powerful fighters. To attract Toshin, Heihachi decides to host the King of
Iron Fist Tournament 3.

Four years later, on Jin Kazama's 19th birthday, the curtains rise for the
                        King of Iron Fist Tournament 3...

Well, after months of hard work, The Tekken 3 Manual: ACT.1 is finally a
reality. This is the first in a series of three guides created to make you a
better player, no matter what your skill level. The idea for this series was
sparked from reading the wonderful Japanese Gamest Mook books, and wishing
there were something similar for American players. After looking around, I
realized there was nothing, so I decided to go for it. What follows is the
result of many months of hard work and research by not only myself, but a
great team of Tekken 3 players and friends. Well, that's about it. Start
reading, and remember this is new... and I am sure there are many corrections
to be made. Feel free to send them to me via, e-mail. Have fun!!!

The Tekken 3 Manual: Act.1 now includes Playstation information, covering all
new characters, and secrets. Be sure to check out www.tekken.net too!!!

The System section is basically designed to teach players how the Tekken 3
engine (system) works. Whether you are an advanced player, or just starting
out, I'm sure there is something in here for you. Take your time getting
accustomed to each of the various gameplay options, in the long run it will
surely pay off.

Many times during this guide you will see the term "frames". The word "frames"
refers to frames of animation. Tekken 3 runs at a smooth 60 frames per second
(fps) and all references to "frames" refers to the number of frames it takes
for a particular move to execute/recover.

==============================================================================
= :: Movement :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: SYSTEM :: =
==============================================================================

In order to be able to successfully attack and defend against your opponent,
you need to know how to move around in order to gain the initiative. Moving
around in Tekken 3 is used to position yourself to attack and/or defend. Each
of the different movement options has its own special uses and you should
definitely be familiar with each of them before you try anything tricky.


-Walking-

This is the most basic of all movement options. Walking is also the least
effective. Walking can be useful to move slight distances when it's important
to move only a small amount, such as in combos.


-Dashing-

Dashing is definitely the most common way to get around in Tekken 3. Dashing
can be performed either forwards or backwards, and is done by quickly tapping
the controller twice in the direction you wish to travel. Since dashing is
faster than walking, covering 4.5 steps at once, it's the obvious choice to
get around. Often players find themselves being struck during or after a
backdash is fully complete. This is because you are unable to block during the
backdash, and for 60 frames after it has been fully completed. However, during
a backdash, you can attack or sidestep cancel.


-Running-

Running is one of the most misunderstood aspects of Tekken 3 movement. First
of all, running is the quickest way to cover large distances. Depending on how
long your character runs for, different options are available to them. After
running for between 11 and 18 steps, every character will tackle their
opponent to the ground. From the 12th step on, characters with slides and
cross chops will be able to perform them. From the 18th until the run ends,
all characters will perform the unblockable shoulder ram. The entire run
animation ends at the 22nd step. The numbers in the grid below represent steps
traveled.
                                  .

  |    |
  |    `- (between 11-18 steps) will perform tackle
  |
  `- (6 steps) begin running

Slides are performed by running for at least 12 steps, then pressing right
kick (4). Slides hit low and connect with downed opponents. The characters
that cannot perform slides are: King/Yoshimitsu/Gon.

Flying Cross Chops are performed by running for as least 12 steps, then
pressing both punches (1+2). Flying cross chops hit mid and cause guard stun.


-Crouch Walking-

Crouch walking is a universal feature and is great for getting right up in an
opponent's face when you expect a standing throw or high attack attempt.
Crouch walking is performed by holding down/forward (D/F) on the controller.


-Crouch Dashing-

Crouch dashing is an alternate form of dashing which can actually avoid many
high attacks. A crouch dash is a special advancement maneuver which begins
high, moves you towards your opponent, and recovers in a crouch. Characters
which can perform a crouch dash are: Jin/King/Hwoarang/Heihachi. To perform a
crouch dash, tap forward on the controller, return the joystick to neutral,
then roll the controller from down to down/forward: f,N,d,D/F. Holding back on
the controller will cancel the crouch dash.

Law has his own unique way to crouch dash. First he must be in a full crouch,
then you must roll the controller to down/forward, back to down, then back to
down/forward, which you must hold for a split second. I'm sure this sounds
tricky. This is how it looks in standard conventions: FC,d/f,d,D/F.


-Rolling Dashing-

Rolling dashing is very much like crouch dashing, except that rolling dashes
recover high. Characters will a rolling dash are: Paul/Nina/Bryan/Heihachi/
and Anna. To perform a rolling dash, roll the controller from down to forward:
QCF, or d,d/f,f.


-Swaying-

Swaying is basically a backwards crouch dash, and can only be performed by:
Paul/Nina/Bryan. To perform a sway, roll the controller from down to back:
QCB, or d,d/b,b. A special bonus of Nina's sway is the fact that it
auto-blocks low for you.


-Side Stepping-

Sidestepping is basically a new feature for Tekken 3, since not everyone had a
sidestep in Tekken 2. Sidestepping is used to avoid attacks, as well as for
confusing opponents. To perform a sidestep, tap up or down on the controller
and return the stick to neutral. Sidesteps are best used when in close as you
will have a better chance of getting to your opponent's side for a side throw.
The distance characters travel during their sidestep differs. About halfway
through a sidestep, you can cut it short by pressing any button or joystick
motion. By doing this, you will immediately perform the attack or direction
you input. Every character can also sidestep while their back is turned (BK).
This is performed the same way as a normal sidestep. The back-turned sidestep
is quick and doesn't cover as much distance as a normal sidestep. It will also
turn your character back around to face your opponent, except Ling who remains
standing with her back turned. The particular sidestep frame information is
listed below.

 |   `- considered back turned to this point

-Jumping-

There are two types of jumping in Tekken 3: Hopping and Leaping. A hop is a
short jump which is performed by tapping the controller up/back, up, or
up/forward and holding for a split second. Hops are great for jumping over low
attacks and jumping over downed opponents. A leap is a larger jump which is
performed by holding up/back, up, or up/forward. While in a leap, each
character can perform a jump-stun by pressing left kick (3) as they begin to
descend from their leap. If the kick is unguarded, your opponent will become
double over stunned (DS). After landing from a Leap, characters can perform
any WS attack.


-Backflip Evades-

A backflip evade is a character-specific maneuver which allows a character to
handspring backwards away from an opponent. The characters that can perform a
backflip evade are: Nina/Yoshimitsu/Ling/Eddy/Anna. A backflip evade is
executed by rolling the stick from up to up/back: u,u/b. The advantages of a
backflip evade are very decent. First of all, you cannot be thrown out of a
backflip evade. They also cover more distance than a basic backdash. The main
problem of backflip evades is that you are vulnerable during the entire
execution time.


==============================================================================
= :: Gameplay Elements ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: SYSTEM :: =
==============================================================================

-Damage-

Damage in Tekken 3 is based on a points system. Throughout this guide you will
see numbers referring to "damage". This simply refers to the amount of energy
a particular move will take from your opponent's energy bar. Typical settings
in the arcade give a 110-point energy bar during 1player mode and a 140-point
energy bar in 2player mode. These numbers might be different in your arcade if
the settings have been adjusted. Even if the settings have been changed in
your arcade, the points inflicted by a move will always remain constant. The
only exception to this is if the move hits on a counter hit of any kind. This
will actually make the move do more damage than is actually listed in this
guide.


-Guarding-

Guarding is the single most important element of Tekken 3. Without being able
to successfully defend against your opponent's attacks, you have no chance of
surviving long enough to damage them. The two basic forms of guarding are:
Neutral/Active guarding. They are as follows:

Neutral guarding is a relatively straightforward procedure. To defend against
high and mid attacks, leave the joystick neutral. To defend against low
attacks, hold down. The problem with neutral guarding is that is it is not a
certainty. After many guard-breaking attacks and/or hits chained onto moves
which have already connected, leaving the joystick neutral will not guard. The
way around this is active guarding. It is important to know that this is a dip
switch setting within the Tekken 3 options menu, and in some arcades it might
be turned off.

Active guarding is most used by the majority of top level players. To defend
against high and mid attacks, hold back on the joystick. To defend against low
attacks, hold back/down simultaneously. This technique is much more effective
against strings of attacks, and is highly recommended by top level players.


-Guard Damage-

Guard damage is a term which refers to damage which is actually inflicted when
an opponent guards certain attacks. It is important to know that this is a dip
switch setting within the Tekken 3 options menu, and in some arcades it might
be turned on. This means that every attack that is guarded against will do a
small amount of damage. By default, guard damage is turned off.


-Attack Ranges-

Knowing when and where to strike is a major aspect of Tekken 3 success. There
are 4 basic hit ranges: High (h); Mid (m); Low (l); and Special Mid (Sm). To
guard against high/mid attacks, hold back on the joystick (unless you prefer
to use neutral guard). To guard against low attacks, hold down/back on the
joystick (unless you prefer to use neutral guard, in which case you just hold
down). To guard against special mid attacks, you may hold either back or
down/back on the joystick (unless you prefer to use neutral guard, in which
case you would do nothing).

There are 4 advanced hit ranges: High Throw; Crouch Throw; Ground Attack; and
Unblockable. High throws only connect with standing opponents. Crouch throws
only connect with crouching opponents. A very select few throws in Tekken 3
are actually catch throws. This means, besides being throws, they actually
have hit ranges as well. The advantage to this is, if you guard a catch throw
wrong, but the actual throw doesn't grab you, it still can do damage to you
like a special attack would. Ground attacks hit opponents on the ground and
are signified throughout this guide by way of capital letters (ex. H,M,L). A
capitol letter as a hit range signifies that the indicated attack will hit a
downed opponent. Unblockable attacks cannot be guarded against by simply
holding back or down/back on the joystick (unless otherwise noted). To guard
against unblockable attacks, either get out of range, sidestep the attack,
stop the attack before it executes completely, or you can choose to use an
attack reversal/parry. 


-Throws-

Throws are moves which, after intiated, do a considerable amount of damage to
your opponent. The best thing about throws is the that they are very quick
ways do deal damage. Also, most throws are easier to execute than combos. To
perform a basic throw with any character, simultaneously press either left
punch and left kick or right punch and right kick (1+3 or 2+4). Even though
the motion to perform basic throws is the same for each character, the actual
throw performed, as well as the damage, differs depending on which character
you are using.

Special throws are similar to basic throws except they require specific
joystick and button combinations to perform. On the whole, special throws
inflict more damage that basic throws. This is not always the case, but
generally, special throws are more rewarding than basic throws.

Side throws are performed exactly like basic throws (1+3 or 2+4) except they
only take effect when you grab an opponent from the side. Most sidethrows also
inflict more damage than basic throws, and they also have great animations.

Back throws are performed exactly like basic and side throws (1+3 or 2+4)
except they only take effect when you grab an opponent from behind. Back
throws generally do more damage than any other form of throw, and once
initiated, they cannot be escaped.

Every character can perform a throw while in back-turned (BK) position by
simultaneously pressing either left punch and left kick or right punch and
right kick (1+3 or 2+4). For a back-turned throw, characters will turn around
and attempt to grab their opponent. If they whiff the throw-attempt, they
remain facing forward. Lei/Ling will turn back around into back-turned
position after a whiffed back turned throw attempt.


-Multi-Part Throws-

Multi-Part throws, also known as link throws, are throws which have an initial
grab, followed by one or more continuations. Multi-part throws take special
timing to perform and often take a lot of practice. Most of the major damage
multi-part throws can be escaped to avoid excess damage.


-Escapes-

Escapes are maneuvers which can evade taking damage, even after certain
attacks have been initiated. Every throw/multi-throw can be escaped except the
Ogres' Waning Moon (d/f,d/f+2+4) and certain links within multi-throws. All
throw escapes will be listed in the character's throw section.

Tackle escapes are the most complex of all escapes. Depending on whether your
opponent uses a punch series, an arm bar/leg hold, or both, you must use the
correct escape. You also have escape options as you are being tackled. All
tackle escape information is listed below. Yoshi's Sword cut and Gun Jack's
Face Bash cannot be escaped after a tackle.

-Reversals-

Attack reversals are character-specific maneuvers which grab an opponent's
outstretched limbs, then do damage depending on which move was reversed. The
characters with attack reversals are: Nina/Jin/Paul/King/Law/Anna. Out of
these characters, only Nina/Jin/Paul/Anna can reverse both high/mid kicks and
high/mid punches. King can only reverse high/mid kicks and the special
Lightning Kick. Law can only reverse high/mid punches.

Heihachi has a special right-kick-only reversal which will automatically
reverse any right kick that hits Heihachi on major counter (MC).

Ogre's God Reversal high attack reversal has no whiff animation. You must
perform the reversal motion right as an attack is about to make contact with
your character.

Ogre 2's Deadly Revenge mid/low punch reversal has no whiff animation. You
must first be in a full crouch, then as a mid/low punch is about to hit you,
roll the stick from the full crouch to down/forward.

Reversal specific damage/input time/recovery information is listed below.

Jin/Paul/Nina/Anna: High/Mid Reversal
(b+1+3 or b+2+4)
Active between the 2nd-10th frames
26 frames of recovery (if whiffed)
38 frames of execution (if whiffed)

King: High/Mid Kick Reversal
(b+1+3 or b+2+4)
Active between the 2nd-14th frames
22 frames of recovery (if whiffed)
36 frames of execution (if whiffed)

Law: Tricky Step High/Mid Punch Reversal
(b+1+2)
Active between the 5th-20th frames
Recovers in the Tricky Step (if whiffed)


-Parries-

Parries are character-specific maneuvers which knock/push an opponent's attack
to the side, giving the character performing the parry an advantage. There are
two different types of parries: High/Mid Parries; and low parries. Characters
with the High/Mid Parry are: Law/Ling/Lei. Characters with the Low Parry are:
Nina/King/Yoshimitsu/Bryan/Julia/Lei/Law/Ling/Hwoarang. A high/mid parry gives
a 7-frame advantage. A low parry against a low punch gives a 14-frame
advantage. A low parry against a low kick is the best possible parry situation
as it gives a 26-frame advantage.

Law/Ling: High Parry
(Law: b+1+3 or b+2+4, Ling: 1+4)
Active between the 2nd-11th frames
24 frames of recovery (if whiffed)
35 frames of execution (if whiffed)

Law/Nina/Lei/King/Yoshi/Ling/Hwoarang/Julia/Bryan: Low Parry
(Law/Nina/Lei/Yoshi/Hwoarang/Julia/Bryan: d+1+3 or d+2+4)
(King: d+1+4 or d+2+3)
(Ling: d+1+4)
Active between the 2nd-14th frames
2 frames of recovery (if whiffed)
16 frames of execution (if whiffed)

Lei: Drunken Stance High/Mid Punch Parry
(f+3+4)
Active between the 5th-25th frames*
Recovers in Drunken Stance (DRN)
(*: the active time becomes reactive again during the Drunken Stance. also
    permanently active against high punches)(need to confirm)


-Special Reversal/Parry Information-

Within Tekken 3, there are numerous reversal and parry tricks that you should
be aware of. There are also special options available to specific characters
during certain matches. Each of them are listed below:

As a special High/Mid punch reversal and High/Mid punch parry option, the
characters with high/mid punch reversals and high/mid punch parries can
actually reverse/parry a tackle attempt. This works for either running tackles
or character specific tackles.

As a bonus, maybe even a bug/glitch, King's kick reversal can actually grab
lightning kicks.

Law and Lei have a special Reversal/Parry option available against Nina/Anna
only. If Nina/Anna attempts her Neck Throw (u/f+1+2), Law can Tricky Step
Reversal, and Lei can Drunken Stance Parry.

As a special low parry option, the characters with low parries can actually
parry low rising kicks and lightning kicks. The characters with this ability
are: Law/Nina/Lei/King/Yoshi/Ling/Hwoarang/Julia/Bryan.

Heihachi's Headbutt Carnival can only be performed on certain characters, but
as a bonus, those characters, Jin/Paul/Lei/Kuma/Heihachi, can actually reverse
the throw with both punches (1+2) and headbutt Heihachi back. This can be
continued until one character loses all their energy.

If Nina performs her Single Slap (b+2) or Double Slap (b+2,2) and the first
slap connects, any female character can slap her back by simply pressing right
punch (2). This can continue until one character loses all their energy. This
slap reversal also works with Mokujin, and have a female character's moves.


Certain attacks or certain hits within attacks cannot be reversed or parried.
A complete listing of irreversable/unparriable moves is below:

X = character cannot reverse move
O = character can reverse move
- = non applicable
1st / 2nd / 3rd = moves in series which cannot be reversed
If no move is indicated, all hits of move cannot be reversed

-Chickens-

If you know that your opponent is going to reverse one of your attacks, you
can use an attack-reversal reversal, also known as a "chicken". To perform a
chicken, you must be aware of the limb you are using to attack. If you attack
with a left limb (left punch, left kick, or most moves in which a left limb is
being used to attack) you must chicken with f+1+3. If you attack with a right
limb (right punch, right kick, or most moves in which a right limb is being
used to attack) you must chicken with f+2+4. To explain it better, here is a
scenario: Nina performed her Bad Habit (f,f+3), and Jin reverses (b+2+4), Nina
must chicken with f+1+3 because the Bad Habit is a left kick. It is probably
near impossible to perform chickens on reaction, so it is best just to perform
them immediately after you perform any move you think might be reversed. Law's
and King's reversal cannot be chickened. Special chicken frame information is
listed below.

VS Jin:
Left Punch is reversed:  10 frames to input a chicken
Right Punch is reversed: 10 frames to input a chicken
Left Kick is reversed:   8 frames to input a chicken
Right Kick is reversed:  7 frames to input a chicken

VS Nina/Anna:
Left Punch is reversed:  8 frames to input a chicken
Right Punch is reversed: 7 frames to input a chicken
Left Kick is reversed:   8 frames to input a chicken
Right Kick is reversed:  8 frames to input a chicken

VS Paul:
Left Punch is reversed:  10 frames to input a chicken
Right Punch is reversed: 10 frames to input a chicken
Left Kick is reversed:   8 frames to input a chicken
Right Kick is reversed:  8 frames to input a chicken

Against a Deathfist (Paul/Heihachi)
Must be chickened with u/f+2+4 against Paul/Jin within 7 frames.
Must be chickened with f+2+4 against Nina/Anna within 8 frames.

Against a Thunder Godfist (Jin/Heihachi)
Must be chickened with f+2+4 against Nina/Anna within 6 frames.

Against a Nina right kick
Must be chickened with f+2+4 against Nina/Anna within 5 frames.

Against a Nina/Anna right punch
Must be chickened with f+2+4 against within 7 frames.


Chickens do different damage and give different advantage times depending on
who is chickening who. The specifics are below.

A chickened Left Punch/Right Punch/Left Kick with everyone except Jin/Heihachi
results in 0 frames of advantage and 11 damage.

A chickened Right Kick with everyone except Jin/Heihachi results in 14 frames
of advantage and 12 damage.

A chickened Left Punch/Right Punch/Left Kick with Jin/Heihachi results in 7
frames of advantage and 12 damage.

A chickened Right Kick with Jin/Heihachi results in 8 frames of advantage and
13 damage.


Certain special attacks can be confusing to chicken. This is either because of
a double button input to actually perform the move (ex. Jin's d+3+4), or the
character attacks with two limbs at once (ex. Nina's f+1+2). Below is a list
to clarify which side an attack must be chickened from:

-Stuns-

A stun is a move which renders an opponent helpless for a short period of
time. Certain stuns knock opponents over such as: double-over stuns/crumple
stuns. Other stuns just stop an opponent from being able to control their
character for a short time such as: drop-knee stun/guard stun/turn stun. 

A double-over stunned (DS) opponent grabs his/her stomach and slowly falls to
the ground. During this time, opponents can be thrown, you are guaranteed at
least one quick strike, and quick combos can be initiated. Double-over stuns
are probably the deadliest of all stuns. Certain double-over stuns can be
escaped by holding forward on the joystick as soon as you are stunned. Those
that can be escaped are: Second hit of Jin's Laser Cannon/Scraper; Bryan's
Cheap Trick and his High Knee Kick; Julia's Palm Explosion; Heihachi's Left
Splits Kick; and the first hit of Lei's Snakebite.

A crumple stun (CS) is a faster version of a double-over stun. When characters
are hit with a crumple stun they will immediately fall to the ground. Even
though characters fall to the ground, some combos can be initiated from a
crumple stun.

A drop-knee stun (KS) happens when your opponent fails to guard a drop stun
move correctly. If they are hit with a drop-knee stun maneuver while guarding
the incorrect way, they will be forced down to their knee. This gives the
stunning character a small advantage. Characters caught guarding the incorrect
way against a drop-knee stun will recover crouching (RC).

A guard stun (GS)is any move which strips your opponents ability to guard for
a short period of time. Any character hit with a guard stun will be unable to
control their character, thus giving the character initiating the guard stun a
small advantage.

A turn stun (TS) is any move which knocks your opponents position out of
alignment. These stuns have basically the same property as a guard stun, with
the added ability to force your opponent to turn slightly away from you.


-Staggers-

A stagger is another style move which renders your opponent helpless for a
short period of time, except they do have an option. A stagger knocks your
opponent backwards, giving you a short advantage time. If you are staggered
you can hold down and your character will fall to the ground. This is very
useful for avoiding guaranteed stagger follow-ups.


-Combos-

Combos (or combinations) are a very important part of attacking, especially in
high level play. By definition in "fighting game terms", a "combo" is a string
of moves which are unblockable after the first hit. This basically means that
once you have initiated a combo, all following hits cannot be guarded against.
It is very important to have a good repertoire of combos at your disposal for
different situations that arise. By being able to damage your opponent as much
and as fast as possible, you can definitely increase your odds of victory.

To try to keep combo damage within reason, Namco made it so that consecutive
hits within a "true" combo do less damage than if the move(s) had actually hit
outside of the combo. The damage modifiers for a combo basically follow the
rule of: 1st = 100%(+); 2nd = 80%; 3rd-Final = 50%. This means that the first
hit within a combo always inflicts full damage. The second hit within a combo
inflicts 80% of its normal damage. Any hit after the second hit in a combo
will inflict 50% damage. I'm not sure if this is 100% accurate, but that's
what the Gamest Mook has listed, so until it's proved otherwise, that's it. =)


-Buffering-

Buffering is an advanced technique used by top level players to make their
command inputs more efficient. By buffering, you can actually speed up the
input time for executing moves. Another great use for buffering is to keep
your opponent from catching you with a surprise attack reversal. This
technique is called "buffering a chicken". Yes, I know it sounds funny, but it
is one technique you should have down. To buffer a chicken, execute your
desired attack and immediately follow the command with the appropriate chicken
motion. To help you understand what I mean, take a look at this scenario: You
are playing as Nina against Jin. You want to use her Bad Habit (f,f+3) but you
are worried about Jin reversing it. To be on the safe side, you decide to
buffer a chicken. This is how the whole sequence would look: f,f+3,f+1+3. This
way, you perform the bad habit, and you have a chicken buffered in the game's
short term memory. If the Jin player reversed your Bad Habit, Nina would
immediately chicken the reversal. The buffered chicken will only remain in
memory for a very short time, and it does not carry over to other moves. If
Jin blocks the Bad Habit and decides not to reverse, the buffered chicken will
no longer be in memory.


-Counters-

Countering is a loosely used term in many fighting games, and the meaning can
differ from situation to situation. In Tekken 3, there is a very complex
countering system, which needs to be explained. There are 2 different types of
counters, both with their own properties. These are: Minor Counter; Major
Counter. Damage changes between a regular hit, a minor counter, and a major
counter.

A minor counter (mC) is basically any move which hits your opponent during the
recovery time of one of their moves. An example of this would be: Heihachi
performs his Twin Pistons (d/f+1,2) and King blocks it. While Heihachi is
recovering from the blocked Twin Pistons, King performs his Prison Break
(b+4). The Prison Break hits on a minor counter, and the damage is adjusted
accordingly. If any move connects on a minor counter, the damage it inflicts
normally is modified by 1.25. So, for example, if a move normally inflicts
50 damage, if it connects on a minor counter, it will inflict about 62-63
damage.

A major counter (MC) is basically any move which hits your opponent during the
execution time of one of their moves. An example of this would be: Paul
performs his Burning Fist (b+1+2). Before the Burning Fist actually attacks,
Julia performs her Twin Arrow. The Twin Arrow hits on a major counter, and the
damage is adjusted accordingly. If any move connects on a major counter, the
damage it inflicts normally is modified by 1.50. So, for example, if a move
normally inflicts 50 damage, if it connects on a major counter, it will
inflict 75 damage.

Throughout this guide, any CH or c modifier comment will refer to a Major
Counter.


-Supercharger-

The supercharger is a new Tekken 3 feature, which has some very interesting
side effects. Each character can perform a supercharger by pressing ALL four
buttons together (ALL or 1+2+3+4). The specific effects after a supercharger
it performed are:

When charged/charging, your character is unable to guard. If you are struck
with any attack, it will be treated as a counter hit (CH) and the charge will
instantly wear off.

When charged, the first hit that your opponent fails to block will be treated
as a counter hit (CH) and the charge will wear off instantly.

When charged, any attacks your opponent guards will incur guard damage.

Charging wears off by itself after about 5 seconds. You can be thrown while
charged and you will still remained charged.

= :: Getting Up From The Ground :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: SYSTEM :: =
==============================================================================

Getting up from the ground is a tactic that you must really have a handle on
to survive at high level play. Even though you are lying on the ground, it
does not mean you are safe from attacks. Also, if you try to get up the wrong
way, your opponent can pummel you right back down to the ground. There are
many different ways to get off the floor, each with their own advantages and
disadvantages.


-Rise/Roll-Block-

The most basic form of getting off the ground is simply standing and guarding,
or rolling once, then guarding. To stand up, hold up on the joystick and your
character will stand right up. To roll first, press forwards or backwards on
the joystick and your character will roll, then stand up. When your character
is lying on his/her back, holding down and pressing left punch (1) will roll
them over to their face and they will remain grounded, then you have the other
options of either standing up or rolling a direction first. From each
different downed position, the execution time and attack recovery varies, each
will be explained in the grid below.


-Attack-

Once knocked down, any character can attack with either a mid or low kick by
pressing left kick (3) for a low kick, or right kick (4) for a mid kick. From
each different downed position, the execution time and attack recovery varies,
each will be explained in the grid below.


-Roll/Attack-

Rolling then attacking is useful to avoid an opponents ground attack, then
striking them before they can recover. A rolling attack is done by first
tapping the joystick forward or backwards to roll in the desired direction,
then pressing left kick (3) for a low kick, or right kick (4) for a mid kick.
From each different downed position, the execution time and attack recovery
varies, each will be explained in the grid below.


-Rising Information-

Guard:    indicates the number of frames it takes to stand/roll forward/roll
          backward and guard.

Attack:   indicates the number of frames it takes to stand/roll forward/roll
          backward and attack, and the recovery of that action.

Input:    indicates the number of frames you have to input the desired attack
          after beginning to stand/roll.

Recovery: indicates the position that your character will recover in after
          performing the desired action.

h/m/l represent attack ranges. The first number represents frames of execution
before the attack makes contact. The number in parentheses (if applicable)
shows the recovery time for the indicated attack.

(*: Lei has no rising mid kick from Slide Position (SLD).)

-Special Rising Attacks-

When knocked down, certain characters can perform special rising attacks which
yield different result. Cross Chops are performed by rolling forward or
backward then immediately pressing forward and both punches (f+1+2). Depending
on how close your opponent is, you will create a different amount of stun,
giving you the advantage. Lei/Ling/Hwoarang cannot perform the cross chop. A
double pop kick can only be performed while in knockdown position (KND) which
is done by pressing back twice on the joystick and both kicks (b,b+3+4).
King/Eddy/Paul/Yoshi/Ling/Gun Jack/Ogres cannot perform the double pop kick. A
reverse double pop kick is performed exactly the same way as the reverse pop
kick, only King/Eddy have this attack. Each special rising attack has
different recovery and execution time, and is listed below. The backflip to
front dive is a fake roll back into a cross chop. It is performed exactly like
the double pop kick. Only Yoshi/Paul can perform the backflip to front cross
chop. (need to confirm list)

Type:                 | Execution Frms: | Recovery Frms: | Advantage Frms:
For. Rll-Cross Chop:  | 50              | 11             | 4 to 31
Back. Rll-Cross Chop: | 42              | 4              | 4 to 30
Backflip-Cross Chop:  | 62              | 10             | 4 to 14
Double Pop Kick:      | 30              | 22             | 4 to 14
Reverse Dbl Pop Kick: | 30              | +38 (BK)       | 4 to 14


-Tech Rolls-

A tech roll, also known as a quick rise (QR), is a move which breaks your
fall and rolls you to the side immediately after being knocked down. A tech
roll can only be performed if you are knocked down and you land on your back.
Landing any other way (on your head, side, face, knees...) will strip you of
the ability to tech roll. To perform a tech roll, you must press any button
within 3 frames of hitting the ground. By pressing either punch (1 or 2), your
character will land and roll towards the background. By pressing either kick
button (3 or 4), the character will land and roll towards the foreground.

                         .

There are a few other special tech roll options. If your character is thrown
by Jin's Stonehead, Law's Knee Lift, King's Giant Swing, Kuma & Panda's
Stonehead, Gun Jack's Lift Up-Megaton Hit, and Heihachi's Stonehead, you can
tech roll as you hit the ground. This is especially important in the case of
King's Giant Swing, as you will considerably reduce the damage inflicted. The
last special tech roll option is available only to Paul. If Nina reverses one
of Paul's high punches, he can tech roll as he lands.


-Lightning Kick-

A lightning kick, also known as ankle kick, is a very high priority maneuver
which can only be performed while your character in knockdown position (KND).
A lightning kick is performed by holding down on the joystick and pressing
either left kick or right kick (D+3 or D+4). Character which do not have a
lightning kick are: Heihachi/Bryan/Ogre/Ogre 2/Gun Jack/Kuma/Dr. B. If a
lightning kick makes contact with an opponent, you can usually rise safely.

his son from entering any contests outside the dojo. Marshall's long-time
friend and competitor Paul Phoenix visits once every few months to spar with

telling him he's a better fighter than his father. Forest knew his father

the dojo. Marshall was enraged when he found out what happened. To him, it was

One day, when he was 19, Eddy came home from school to find his father shot

in recent weeks.

Eddy's father working to destroy the drug cartel in Brazil. His untimely death
occurred just when he had obtained enough evidence to put the kingpins away
for good. In his last breaths, Eddy's father told him, "Now is not the right
time to fight. Falsely admit to the crime and hide in prison. Only there will
you be safe". Eddy went along with his father's last wish and the model
student went from a life of luxury to incarceration as a murderer.

Prison life was hell and not a day went by that Eddy didn't vow to get even
with his father's killers. One day during a prison riot he watched an old man
with great power fighting using a technique he called Capoeira. For 8 years
Eddy practiced until he became a master and could be considered a lethal

When Jane, now a physicist, was eight years old, she was rescued from a
bacteriological war by the Russian military robot Jack-2. However, Jack-2 was
later destroyed by a satellite weapon as Jane, still a young girl, watched in
horror.

Jane, now 27, could not forget the nightmare of Jack-2's having collapsed
beside her. She spent ten years restoring Jack-2 to 90% functionality, but it
seemed to have lost the humane characteristics that set it apart from Jack-1.

Jane worked hard analyzing the program in order to return to Jack2 the gentle
soul which had saved her life. Through detailed analysis, she found that most
of Jack-2's programming was created by Mishima Heavy Industry, one of the
subsidiaries of the Mishima Financial Empire. Moreover, she discovered a
hidden program... 'Project Gun Jack'. It laid the groundwork for a new weapon,
a pivot gun.

In order to restore Jack-2 completely, Jane had to approach Mishima Financial
Empire and solve the mystery of the project. She quickly installed the hidden
program and brought to Mishima Financial Empire the newly dubbed Gun Jack.

Boskonovitch and reanimated Fury's body and sent him off to collect this data.

-Story-

FAMILY MATTERS

Heihachi retrieved the Mishima Financial Empire by defeating his son.

Scheming to further develop the MFE, Heihachi organized "Tekken Force", the
MFE's private corps and dispatched them to settle disputes and brought waste
land under cultivation to feed the poor countries of the world to gain support
of leaders worldwide.

Fifteen years later, a secret excavation by the Tekken Forces in Central
American ruins unearths an unusual find. They were annihilated by a mysterious
being.

Heihachi realized that the mysterious being could be the legendary God of
Fighting, and took action to realize his life's goal, to capture the God of
Fighting and therefore rule the world.

One day, Heihachi was visited by a 15-year-old boy named Jin Kazama. Being
informed that Jin was his grandson and hearing what had happened to his mother
Jun, Heihachi reasoned that the God of Fighting thrives on the "strong souls"
of others. Heihachi trained Jin to use him as a decoy to lure the God of
Fighting.

In Jin's nineteenth year Heihachi declared to the world that the third 'King
of the Iron Fist Tournament' was forthcoming. At the same time he noticed that
Jin, the youngest of Mishima bloodline, began to show the same "dangerous
power" as Kazuya had. Heihachi decided to dispose of Jin after he lured the
God of Fighting in order to end the doomed destiny of the MFE.

SCARLET DREAMS

19 years ago Kazuya confided some alarming news to Anna. Her sister Nina was
planning to become a guinea pig of Dr. Boskonovitch's "Cold Sleep". As much as
they quarreled, Anna would miss her sleeping sister. Worse yet, she would
continue to age while her sister was frozen in time! She too went to
Boskonovitch, subjected her to the Cold Sleep, and asked to be awakened along
with Nina.

Sensing the God of Fight's evil presence, both Nina and Anna awoke 19 years
later. Making an effort to continue their sibling rivalry, Anna was saddened
to find that her sister had somehow lost all memeory of her. Now, rather than
fighting, Anna felt the need to help Nina and prevent her from again becoming
an assassin.
