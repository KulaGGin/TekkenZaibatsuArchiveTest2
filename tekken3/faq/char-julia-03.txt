** All of the juggles in this faq cannot be escaped by tech rolling **


***Juggle Starters***

* <u/f+4> 	**Hopkick**
	
	The simplest and easiest of Julia's juggle starters. She quickly hops in the 
	air with her right foot out kicking the opponent into the air. If you see a 
	chance to juggle, this is probably your best bet because of how quickly it 
	executes and all the options you have to juggle afterwards.

* <f+1> 		**Flash Uppercut**
	
	Julia crouch dashes forwards and does an uppercut with the left arm. 
	Relatively fast although I believe the hopkick would be a better option.
	Also please note this attack will only juggle normal size characters not 
	large ones, it only makes them them stagger backwards. I never use this! 

* <1~1~1> 	**Treble Clef Cannon**
	
	A quick three hit strike with the final lifting the opponent into the air. I 
	find this starter extremely useful in countering and interupting between 
	opponents moves. For instance Paul and Heihachi's Tile Spitter to Deathfist, 
	Julia has a guaranteed juggle if she hits after the Tile Splitter but before 
	the Deathfist. Very Handy.

* <WS, 2,1,1> 	**Tequila Sunrise Combo**
	
	A three hit combo with the first hit a standing uppercut (doesn't float) 
	then the last two hits of the Treble Cleff Cannon. Use after blocking a low 
	attack or dodging a high one. Don't make it obvious you are going to use 
	this move. i.e. Don't just Crouch in front of your opponent suddenly for a 
        large amount of time because your opponent will know exactly whats coming. 
        You could however set this move up (and any other ws or FC starters) with a 
        low jab (d+1~D), a low parry (d+1+3~D) or you could use the instant ws method. 
        There are a few different ways of doing this but I do it as (d~D/F+N).
   

* <CH d+4,1> 	**Low Sweep Uppercut**
	
	A good move if you don't use it too often. Can also be used in Okizeme to 
	lift your opponent once they begin rolling backwards or forwards. The first 
	hit is a low sweep then Julia follows with a juggling uppercut. Decent.

* <CH FC,df+2> 	**Body Elbow**
	
	On a counter the body elbow will double over stun your opponent allowing you 
	to get in some very tasty juggles. After this connects you can get sum very 
        nice juggles. Namely (1,d~d/f+1,2,f,f+1,4) This move can be very hard to spot 
        coming because of its speed. 

* <F+1+4> 	**Heavon Cannon( aka. Unblockable )**
	
	Julias unblockable also doubles as a juggle starter. And to make things 
	better they go flying high in the air giving you plenty of time to juggle. 
	Check the lists below. 

* <df+2,1> 	**Two Punch Cannon Lift**
	
 	This juggle starter can be a little unreliable, because it only floats if 
	the first punch hits, altough when this happens it does float quite well, 
	although because of the distance between you and your opponent afterward it 
	can be quite difficult to juggle from. Just practice em a bit and you 
        shouldn't have too much trouble. It is important that you learn to juggle from
        this because after a low parry connects the d/f+2,1 is guaranteed. 

* <1~2~1> 	**Three Punch Cannon Lift**
	
	A longer version of the above move, but this time it only works on a 
	counterhit. It is fast enough to interrupt though, so it should be used as much 
	as the one above. This launcher is basically exactly the same as <df+2,1> so 
	use the same juggles after launching your opponent. 

* <CH F+4> 	**Counter Hit Right Kick**
	
	This move is excellent in interupting opponents moves and strings, and to 
	top it off you get a very nice juggle. It only works on a counter hit, so time 
        it well.

* <2+3,1> 	**Jab, kick Cannon Combo**
	
	Ok, to be completely and utterly honest, this move sux! 

* <WS 2,4,1> 	**Tequila Sunrise to Low Sweep, Cannon Blast**
	
	Julia rises with a mid uppercut, she then sort of spins 360 degrees then 
	performs a low sweep followed by cannon blast. Very good at confusing your 
	opponent because after the initial while standing combo, Julia can choose 
	many different variations of the string in which to complete. The last part 
        of the ws+2,4,1 works the same as the low sweep to cannon blast <d+4,1>. 
    
        Edit: I mentioned many different variations so I guess I should list em all: 

        * ws+2 > 2 (is the second hit is a counterhit you can juggle)
               > 1,1 (has already been mentioned)
               > 1,4,3 
               > 4,1 (look up)
               > 4,4
               > 4,d+4 

        Good mix-up eh! 
        Back to the ws+2,4,1. One thing I forgot to mention earlier was if the low 
        kick ws+2,(4),1 connects the last hit ws+2,4,(1) is gauranteed and so you get 
        a free juggle. Very, very useful.

*****JUGGLES*****

**Quick Notes**

When Juggling in Tekken it is important to remember that the first part of 
the combo (launcher) will do 100%, the second 80%, and each consequtive hit 
50%. Because of this in some cases a simple juggle will do as much damage as 
a complicated one. For example <1,d,DF+1,2> won't do as much damage as the 
simplier <d,DF+1,2>. This is because on the first juggle the initial damage 
is wasted on a low damage attack, then followed by a powerful attack. But 
now when the two last hits of <1,d,DF+1,2> hits both will only do 50% damage. 
In <d,DF+1,2> however no damage is wasted. The first hit does a 80% and the 
second 50%.I hope you understand what I mean, if not e-mail me and I will 
explain in detail.

***I got the juggle percentage information from The Tekken 3 Manual by 
Tragic, and am not exactly sure if it is totally accurate, although till I 
am shown otherwise this is what it is. If you have'nt already checked out 
his guide you really should, because it is one of the best I have ever 
read***

With beginner players and some intermediate players who are playing with a 
**BIG** character it can be quite fun to launch them in the air then juggle 
them with elbow after elbow. I've finished an entire round by doing this 
with my record standing at 5 elbows. If you're on the end of this however it 
is possible to escape by tech rolling.

**Juggle Lists To Be Performed After Specific Starters**
***Please note I hav'nt listed every single juggle in some of the lists just 
the ones which are the most useful, reliable etc. In some cases you may be 
able to use standard juggles. Just try them out yourself O.K.***


**Juggles beginning with <CH d+4,1> If the opponent isn't lifted with a 
counter it makes juggling a lot more difficult and limits you in what you 
can do. So time it well**

*	d,DF+1,2,f,f+1,4		61	|	Hard		|	5	|


Juggles beginning with <F+1+4>
*	One of my favourite and easy to do juggles after Julia's Heavon 
	Cannon(F+1+4) is her earthquake stomp (U/F+3+4).  It is very easy to do and 
	it is a guaranteed hit after the unblockable because as many Julia players 
	will know you can't tech roll it. After the Heavon Cannon you can pick any 
	standard Juggle above or use the ones I list. The best thing about Julias 
	Unblockable is it is relatively fast and she sort of crouch dashes towards 
	her opponent before hitting, making the move itself hard to counter. It also 
	tracks well picking off late sidesteppers.

*	Any standard juggle
*	U/F+3+4				84	|	Easy		|	2 	|

Juggles beginning with <df+2,1>

after the cannon lift because you have to be very quick.

Juggles beginning with <CH 1~2~1>
*	This floats the same as <df+2,1> so use the  juggles above.

*****************************************************************************



**Stuns**

I thought I would add this section because a stun puts an opponent into a 
position he or she can not defend from so it is the perfect oportunity to 
juggle.

1)* Palm Explosion <f+1~2>
   	This attack on a counter hit causes a double over stun. In other words 
	your opponent will grab their gut and slowly fall to the ground, leaving 
	just enough time beforehand for you to juggle. The move itself is basically 
	a cancelled uppercut into a palm hit. Julia dashes, pauses, then dashes 
	again. Please remember that you can break out of a stun in Tekken.

2)* Body Elbow <FC,df+2>
   	As above this move on a counter hit will cause a Double Over Stun.

3)* Lightening Volt <d,DF+1,2>
	This attack only stuns if the first hit whiffs( misses completely) and the 
	second hits on a counter. Good to cover distances and if you know your 
	opponent will try to attack in between the attack, although not very 
	reliable.

4)* Stun Kick? <U/F,N,3>
   	To perform this attack you must then jump in the air then while still in 
	the air tap 3. Depending on when you pressed 3 you will either hit your 
	opponent in the gut and stun them or low kick them. At the moment the only 
	thing I know you can definately do after this stun is the Twin Arrows <1+2>. 
	This stun can also be done by every character.
