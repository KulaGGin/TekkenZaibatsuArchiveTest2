With the success of Slikatel's (Robert Brassfield) excellent Jin Kazama Guide,
I was compelled to write something similar for Yoshimitsu. This guide is meant
for all Yoshimitsu players, seasoned or not. Its purpose: to provide you, the
player, with as much information as possible on Yoshimitsu. As with Slikatel's
Guide, this guide is geared toward mid to high level play. It does not contain
tactics for beating the CPU characters, nor beating the game in record time.
It does, however, contain new ways to use old moves, and many different
tactics and styles of play. All of the strategy in this guide has been
play-tested many times against many different opponents. I feel it is one of
the most comprehensive guides concerning Yoshimitsu and I hope all readers get
something out of it. Enough rambling... let's get to it!

==============================================================================
= [3] ::::::::::::::::::: Introduction to Yoshimitsu ::::::::::::::::::::::: =
==============================================================================

Yoshimitsu is arguably one of the most potent characters in Tekken 3. However,
he is also one of the more difficult characters to play effectively. Yoshi is
an excellent mix of power/speed/cunning and can be almost unstoppable in the
hands of a master. In the wrong hands, Yoshi is nothing more than +1 on a win
streak. A good Yoshi player can juggle as well as he/she pokes. With Yoshi, if
you don't have the all around game down, you will have a tough time against
even average opponents. Read this guide a few times, soak up as much of it as
you can, then head to the arcade and practice. Yoshi is 95% execution, and 5%
luck (IMHO).


-Strengths-

Yoshi's main strength comes from his ease of juggling. He has the best basic
Uppercut (d/f+2) in the game. He also can juggle from his Kangaroo Kick (4~3),
his Rising Uppercut (WS+2), and his Lunging Sweep (FC,d/f+3). Each of these
starters has great recovery time, and some awesome follow-up juggles. A good
Yoshi player will know when and where to use each of these starters, as well
as have a good repertoire of follow-up juggles when one connects.

Another one of Yoshi's strengths is his ability to keep an opponent blocking
for long stretches of time. His basic Standing Jab (1) is arguably the fastest
move in the game, and can be used to pester opponents by repeatedly poking
them in the face. Mixed in with well placed Side Kicks (d/f+4), basic Low
Punches (d+1), Rising Front Kicks (WS+4), and basic Uppercuts (d/f+2), Yoshi
can keep a hesitant opponent blocking, and force them to attack at the wrong
times as well. These tactics "poking" will be described at length later in the
guide.

Unblockables. Yoshimitsu has the BEST arsenal of unblockable attacks in the
game. He has aerial unblockables, damage-trading unblockables, forward rushing
unblockables, rising unblockables... the list goes on. The most important of
all Yoshi unblockables is the Bad Breath (b,b+1+2,ANY). Not only is it a quick
unblockable, it is also unduckable, uncounterable, it lingers, and last but
not least... you can combo out of it. Not bad if you ask me.

The last major strength of Yoshi is his ability to gain his health back. What
more can you ask for? A competent Yoshi player will gain life back whenever an
opportunity arises. Sometimes having 10 health left instead of 8 can be the
difference between winning and losing.


-Weaknesses-

Of course every character has some form of weaknesses, and Yoshimitsu is no
exception. I think his main weakness is the absence of a side game. This means
he has no really good side stepping attacks. Yoshi does have some great side
throws, but he really has no decent side stepping attacks like some of the
other characters.

Another weakness is his lack of special throws. I know this isn't a major
disadvantage, but in high level play, good players go for the special throws,
which are usually harder to escape. Now... since Yoshi only has one special
throw (Rainbow Drop QCB+1+2), anti-Yoshi players will have no problem escaping
it when they know it's coming.

Besides those two weaknesses, the only other problem with Yoshi I can think of
is that he is a very skill-orientated character. To me, this means that he
takes a lot more practice/patience to achieve high level playing capability
than say, Paul or Law. Like Slikatel pointed out, and most of us already know,
Paul and Law can win at an average level with just a few basic moves. They
both have high damage/quick recovery moves which are semi-easy to execute. I
do, however, feel that these characters can be played on a higher level, with
great strategy and tactics, but I feel that on the beginner/average level, the
Paul/Law players will come out ahead.


-General Play Style-

In my opinion, I think Yoshimitsu (as well as most of the Tekken 3 characters)
is more effective on the attack. He excels at juggling and poking, which are
two major assets in Tekken 3. With the addition of Reversal Reversals (a.k.a.
"chickens") a well played Yoshi can attack constantly, with little regard for
an opponents retaliation. Now I don't mean you can just forget your opponent
is there and just attack without cause. What I do mean, is that with a well
planned attack, you can keep players blocking as you come up with your next
set of moves. This is effective because, while you are attacking, the person
you are attacking is worried about taking damage, thus concentrating on your
attacks, looking for an opening in which to attack back when possible. You, on
the other hand, are pelting your opponent with simple attacks i.e. Jab, Side
Kick, Low Punch. This doesn't require strenuous thinking on your part, letting
you think of what to do next. This is a great advantage as I am sure you can
already imagine.

Even though Yoshimitsu is an offensive character, you still need an effective
defense to stop people from doing the same to you. Well-timed Low Punches
(d+1) and Rising Front Kicks (WS+4) can keep almost anyone at bay. More risky
moves, such as the Kangaroo Kick (4~3) are also very effective for defensive
purposes, but must be used at the correct times. These opportunities will be
discussed later in the strategy section. Skilled Yoshimitsu players will be on
the attack, even when they are on the retreat. What I mean is: if you need to
get away from pokers, instead of dashing back, attack them with a fast Low
Punch (d+1) and start your attacking patterns. This way, you can immediately
put Yoshimitsu back into the area he is best at... attacking.


==============================================================================
= [4] ::::::::::::::::::::::::: Yoshimitsu Basics :::::::::::::::::::::::::: =
==============================================================================

There are two main basics concerning Yoshimitsu. One is the Basic Uppercut and
the other is his Unblockable arsenal. Any great Yoshi player will have these
two basics mastered. When I say "basics" I mean part of the foundation of his
strength. Both the Uppercut and the Unblockable arsenal are vital to a high
level Yoshi player.


-The Basic Uppercut-

For some reason, Yoshimitsu's Basic Uppercut (d/f+2) is different than every
other character's Basic Uppercut. Fortunately, it is also better than all the
others as well. It has an extended range because of a built in mini-step. When
the uppercut is performed, Yoshi puts his whole body into the uppercut, which
actually makes him step forward a short distance, as well as duck a tiny bit.
The Basic Uppercut is undoubtedly Yoshimitsu's most useful juggle starter, as
well as an excellent addition of a well tuned poking pattern. When used at the
correct times, you can effectively use uppercut, along with its built in mini
step/duck to attack underneath opponents high attacks. Another reason the
uppercut is listed as one of the Yoshimitsu staple attacks is because of its
ease of use. The only problem is, that if you are playing on bad joysticks,
your Yoshimitsu play can really suffer. It's really no good when each time you
try an uppercut, you get a Backhand (f+2) instead. At any rate, make sure you
can get your Basic Uppercut out when you need it. In my opinion, it's THE most
important move Yoshimitsu possesses. 


-The Art of the Unblockable-

Yoshimitsu has some of the best attacks in the game, and the fact that many of
them are completely unblockable makes them even better. Seasoned Yoshimitsu
players should have uses for all of his unblockables. The Sword Slice (d/b+1)
is one of Yoshi's most useful unblockables. It's extremely fast, and can hit
opponents who are on the ground. Another is the Bad Breath (b,b+1+2,ANY). As
described above, it's probably one of the best moves in the entire game. Yoshi
has nearly twenty different versions of unblockables (depending on how you
count them) making him one of the deadliest characters around. Knowing when to
use each of the unblockables is very important. Even the Sword Impale (b,b+1)
has a use, making sure you know it is smart, not only to better your game, but
to know how to avoid it as well.

This section breaks down each individual moves, coverings its strengths and
weaknesses, as well as its usefulness. Each move is graded on a scale of 1 to
5 indicated by *'s with 5 being the most useful. Each move will also have any
special attributes listed as well. Below is the explanation of the rating
system:

*      - one of Yoshi's least useful moves, very specific uses, hardly used
**     - below Yoshi standards, semi useful in certain situations
***    - standard Yoshi move, decent uses, not bad, not great
****   - above average Yoshi move, great uses, and versatile
*****  - definitely one of Yoshi's best moves, tons of uses, a main attack

Basic Punch            1                   *****          N/A

The Basic Punch is really not an official move, but rather the first attack in
a string of attacks. The reason I gave it it's own section is because it is
one of the most essential moves in any Yoshi players arsenal. It is probably
the fastest move in the game, and has tons of uses. The most important use of
all, is to poke. The Basic Punch comes out very quick, and also retracts fast
as well. This is great for chipping away at opponent's health, and also great
for keeping them on defense. Another excellent use for the Basic Punch is for
filling combos. What I mean is: since the move is so fast, you can knock your
opponent up with a juggle starter, then tack on a few Basic Punches before you
end the combo with a finisher.

Punch-Uppercut         1,2                 ***            N/A

The Punch-Uppercut is another non-official move, but again a set of attacks
that are actually part of a string. The reason it also has its own section is
because it is an useful extension of the Basic Punch. Since many players get
wise to constant poking tactics, and begin to crouch under the Basic Punch,
the Punch-Uppercut is used for hitting them in their crouch. Another good use
for the Punch-Uppercut is to add some distance between Yoshi and his blocking
opponent. Great for setting up Side Kicks.

Punch-Double Uppercut  1,2,1               ***            N/A

The Punch Double Uppercut is one more non-official move. It is best used to
push blocking opponents even further back. It's also great for inducing a
Reversal, which can then be easily Chickened (Reversal Reversal). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PK Combo               2,3                 ***            N/A

The PK Combo is excellent for pushing blocking opponents back. Many times, an
opponent will try to attack in-between the punch and kick and end up taking a
foot to the face. Also, since both hits are guaranteed to connect if the punch
connects on CH it is a great for interrupting attacks. The drawback of this
move is the fact that both hits are high. This means they can easily be ducked
if your opponent knows what to expect. Also, the kick retracts semi-slow, thus
giving your opponent to retaliate with a quick attack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PDK Combo              2,d+3               ***            RC

The PDK Combo is another useful move for pushing opponents back. Like the PK
Combo, both hits are also guaranteed on CH. I like it because the second hit
attacks low, preventing opponents from ducking and retaliating. It's best used
when the opponent is low on health. This is when they are trying to block all
incoming attacks and tend to miss the low block.

Zig-Zag                3,4                 **             N/A

The Zig-Zag is a semi-useful Yoshi attack. It has a big delay in between both
kicks, which make for an interesting mix of Pro/Con. It is good to use when
playing against a defensive player, since they will usually try to block both
kicks, and even Reverse the second kick if their character has one. The main
drawback is that an offensive player will know to rush in-between the kicks
and punish Yoshi. I find it best to use the Zig-Zag to induce reversals and
trick opponents getting up off the floor, into the second kick. Sometimes when
an opponent sees you whiff a standing kick, they will attempt to get up with a
rising attack, thus standing them up into the second hit of the Zig-Zag.

Kangaroo Kick          4~3                 ****           JG

The Kangaroo Kick is one of Yoshimitsu's intimidation moves. Almost every good
Tekken player knows that if they get hit with a Kangaroo Kick, they can kiss
65+ health goodbye. It is his strongest juggle starter, and opponents are very
timid towards trying to reverse/interrupt it because they know if they miss it
they are gone. The best use for the Kangaroo Kick is when your opponent is in
the middle of a string of high attacks. This way, Yoshi will crouch underneath
their attacks, and kick them up. Another good time to use it is when you see
your opponent starting a slow-executed Unblockable i.e. Paul's Burning Fist. A
well skilled Yoshi player can run up and execute this move before the Burning
Fist comes out, thus resulting in a huge damage juggle.

Triple Roundhouses     4,4,4               *              N/A

The Triple Roundhouses are arguably one of Yoshimitsu's worst moves. All three
kicks hit high, and can easily be ducked under. This is even a bigger problem
when you opponent knows to use a Rising Uppercut as a retaliation. When I use
this move, I really only use the first two kicks. This is because it is one of
Yoshimitsu's string starters. In high level play, I suggest you stay away from
this move.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move Name:             Command:            Rating:        Comments:
Backhand               f+2                 ***            OB

The Backhand is more of a retaliation move, than a main attack. It's best to
use after you opponent missed a slow-recovery move. That way it's guaranteed
to force the opponent to turn around, thus giving you a huge advantage. The
drawback of the Backhand is that it his high, and can easily be ducked under.
It also retracts slow and can be punished by a quick attack.

Uppercut-Backhand      d/f+1,2             ***            OB

The Uppercut-Backhand is a useful move for pushing opponents away as well as
tricking them into taking a Backhand in the face. It's probably best used when
you mix it in-between a flurry of Basic Punches, because a wise opponent will
start to crouch underneath the punches. The first hit of the Uppercut-Backhand
hits mid, so it will damage the crouching opponent.

Door Knocker           d/f+1,1,1,1         ****           DL

The Door Knocker is a great move to lure your opponent into taking damage. If
you effectively mix up the Door Knocker with delays into your poking attack
patterns, you can basically trick your opponent into trying to attack, which,
in turn, gives you the advantage. Since the first and last hits of the Door
Knocker hit mid, it's excellent for hitting crouching opponents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Uppercut         d/f+2               *****          JG

This is another non-official move, but needs a special section because it is
probably Yoshimitsu's best move all around. The Basic Uppercut has already
been explained in the Yoshimitsu Basics Section, so I will just use the same
explanation.

"When the uppercut is performed, Yoshi puts his whole body into the uppercut,
which actually makes him step forward a short distance, as well as duck a tiny
bit. The Basic Uppercut is undoubtedly Yoshi's most useful juggle starter, as
well as an excellent addition of a well tuned poking pattern. When used at the
correct times, you can effectively use uppercut, along with its built in mini
step/duck to attack underneath opponents high attacks. Another reason the
uppercut is listed as one of the Yoshimitsu staple attacks is because of its
ease of use. The only problem is, that if you are playing on bad joysticks,
your Yoshimitsu play can really suffer. It's really no good when each time you
try an uppercut, you get a Backhand (f+2) instead. At any rate, make sure you
can get your Basic Uppercut out when you need it. In my opinion, it's THE most
important move Yoshimitsu possesses."

All great Yoshimitsu players know when and where to use the Basic Uppercut. In
addition to knowing when to use it, you should also know how to keep it safe
from Reversals. Make sure you always buffer a Chicken (f+2+4).

Side Kick              d/f+4               *****          N/A

The Side Kick is another staple Yoshimitsu move. It has the best range of any
Yoshi moves, and is great for keeping opponents at bay. In addition to its
range, it comes out incredibly quick, and retracts as fast. This makes it one
of the most potent weapons of all Tekken 3 moves. I find that it is best used
within a sound poking pattern, as the extra range can reach opponents you have
already pushed back. I also use it to finish long-range juggles, it eludes
kind of a "in your face" attitude.

Ninja Blade Rush       f,f+2               ***            N/A

The Ninja Blade Rush is one move that is overlooked by many Yoshi players. It
comes out very quick, moves Yoshi closer to his opponent, and has acceptable
recovery time. You can also substitute the Ninja Blade Rush for the Knee Bash
when finishing combos. It hits a bit lower, so sometimes it's wiser to use it
instead. Just remember it does 2 point less damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ninja Blade Slice      f,f+2               ***            CH

The Ninja Blade Slice is performed exactly like the Ninja Blade Rush. The only
difference is, that if the Ninja Blade Rush hits an opponent on CH, it becomes
the Ninja Blade Slice. Yoshimitsu pulls out his sword and runs to the side of
his opponent, slicing them in the midsection. This is one of Yoshimitsu's best
looking moves, and works well with the Chi-Charge (ALL).

  = Sit                = d+3+4             ***            N/A

If you connect with the Ninja Blade Slice, it's wise to go directly into the
Sit to gain a small amount of life. The one problem about this version of the
Sit is that you can only stand up from it. You cannot use the Teleport or any
of the other attacks from this position.

Stone Fists            B+1,1,1,1,1,1       ****           N/A

The Stone Fists are very vital to the success of a Yoshimitsu player. They
have many great uses, the most important being juggle filler. When you knock
your opponent into the air, you want to inflict as much damage as possible
before they land. One of the best ways to do this, is to use some well timed
Stone Fists. They come out very quick and chain together extremely well.
Another good use for the Stone Fist is for quick advancement towards your
opponent. If you are out of striking range of your opponent, instead of
dashing you can use the Stone Fists. This will move you up closer, as well as
damage any opponent who isn't blocking.

After two consecutive Stone Fists have been executed, Yoshi may immediately go
into his Spinning Low Sweep. Being able to switch from a high attack to a low
attack quickly is a great addition.

Stone Backhands        D/B+2,2,2,2,2,2     ***            RC

The Stone Backhands are a wise addition to a Yoshi players arsenal. Now I
don't mean the entire set of backhands, but more like 1-3 of them. The fact
that the Stone Backhands recover crouching (RC) is a great advantage, since
you can go into a short spurt of backhands, then surprise an opponent with a
Rising Front Kick (WS+4). Another advantage is that they hit mid, so crouching
opponents must block standing up. This opens low attack possibilities, because
since you will automatically be in a crouch, you can do all of your low
attacks as soon as the Stone Backhands recover.

Spinning Low Sweeps    D/B+3,3,3,3,3       ***            RC

Yoshimitsu's Spinning Low Sweeps have been significantly toned down from
Tekken 2. In Tekken 2, all of the sweeps would hit a fallen opponent. This is
no longer the case, as only one low sweep will hit. This doesn't mean that the
Spinning Low Sweeps are completely useless though. They are great for chipping
away at an opponents health as well as training them to block low.

  = Front Kick           = F+4             ****           N/A

The Front Kick addition can only be performed after two consecutive Spinning
Low Sweeps. The Front Kick is great because it hits mid, and the two previous
hits hit low. This entices opponents to block low, then take a Front Kick in
the face. Against high level competition, be sure to keep a Chicken buffered
where needed.

Dive Bomb              f,f+1+2             **             BK

The Dive Bomb is a specialty move. I hardly ever use it, but don't count it
out. It's best purpose is trick your opponent into thinking they have a free
shot at your back. It is imperative to make sure the Dive Bomb connects with
your opponent, blocked or unblocked. That way your opponent will be unable to
respond back, and first have to recover before they attack. Then, when they do
attack, you can use a quick turn around punch (d+1) or kick (d+4) to interrupt
them.

Shark Attack Combo     f,f+3+4,1+2,3+4     **             N/A

The Shark Attack Combo is another specialty move. Each part comes out pretty
slow and it can put you in some really odd predicaments when used incorrectly.
I find that it's best to use it to cover long distances, or for attacking a
charging opponent. It is also useful when playing defensive players. Many
times an opponent will see the attack coming, and attempt to counter-attack
and end up eating some massive damage.

Sword Debate Position  SS+3+4              ****           SDP

Even some of the best Yoshimitsu players often overlook the Sword Debate
Position. This move is great because it lets Yoshimitsu gain his health back.
Yoshimitsu turns his back to his opponent and begins to meditate. When you tap
forward during the Sword Debate Position, Yoshi will turn back around and push
on the hilt of his sword, and gain back energy as he does it. The longer you
stay turned around, the more energy you get back. Besides the obvious drawback
of being turned around during the Sword Debate Position, Yoshimitsu will start
to lose life while his back is turned. He will gain it back once he turns back
around, but you have to know that if he gets hit while his back is turned, he
will not gain any of the lost life back.

Knee Bash              f,f+4               *****          N/A

The Knee Bash is probably Yoshimitsu's second most useful move. It comes out
extremely fast, is excellent for countering opponents, even better when used
as a retaliation move, and a great juggle combo addition. Skilled Yoshimitsu
players will have this move down. Remember to press f and 4 and the same time
to ensure proper execution.

The Jumping Foot Twist is best used to stop incoming rush attacks. The reason
it is rated so well is because of its excellent priority. It also hits mid

Lunging Sweep          FC,d/f+3            ****           RC,JG

The Lunging Sweep is another of Yoshimitsu's power move. Since it is performed
from a crouch, and is a low attack, it is a great pattern addition. It also
recovers crouching (RC) which makes it even more potent. Perhaps the best
thing though, is the fact that is executes very quick, and can start decent
juggle combos. The only drawback of the Lunging Sweep is the lengthy recovery
time which allows for retaliation by a blocking opponent.

Sit                    d+3+4               ****           N/A

Yoshimitsu's Sit maneuver is a very good part of his arsenal. Not only can he
gain life with it, but he can also attack from it and teleport behind his
opponent. The advantage should have already made itself clear.

  = Gain Life            = N               *****          N/A

Gain Life does exactly what it says "gain life". There is not much to describe
about the Gain Life, except that Yoshimitsu gains his health back at a rate of
+5 points every time he bounces.

  = Teleport             = [b_f]           ****           N/A

The Teleport is a very potent tool of Yoshimitsu. When close to an opponent,
pressing b or f on the controller will make Yoshimitsu spin, disappear, and
then re-appear behind his opponents back. Many times you can use the Teleport
and grab an opponent from behind while they are in the middle of attack. This
is absolutely deadly as the Tornado Drop (throw form behind) takes off a huge
70 points of health. The drawback of the Teleport is noticeable when Yoshi
is too far from his opponent. If Yoshi is further than about two character
widths away, he will teleport in place, and end up with his back facing the
opponent. I like to lure people with the Sit, then use the Teleport to quickly
get behind them as they attempt to attack me. A good anti-Yoshi player will
know how to reverse-bait you so you need to use this move wisely. When I say
reverse-bait, I mean they will know to dash in, then backup right as you use
the Teleport, thus leaving your back exposed to them.

  = Meditate             = D               *              N/A

This is, without a doubt, until further review, Yoshimitsu's least useful
moves. I have absolutely no use for this move, other than to provoke your
opponent into attacking.

  = Stone Backhands      = 2,2,2,2,2       ***            RC

The Stone Backhands from the Sit are exactly like the  Stone Backhands from a
standing position. The only difference is the added element of surprise. They
are best used to catch an advancing opponent as they try to dash up and hit
you low.

  = Kangaroo Kick        = 4               ****           JG

Like the Stone Backhands from the Sit, the Kangaroo Kick from the Sit is the
exact same as the Kangaroo Kick from a standing position. The only difference
is the added element of surprise. This move telegraphs itself and it's pretty
easy to spot. The good thing about it is the fact that it goes under a lot of
attacks during execution.

  = Stand Up             = U               *              N/A

If you don't understand this move, you shouldn't be playing Tekken 3.

The Spinning Evade is basically a modified sidestep. The best thing about it
though, is that is steps back and to the side at the same time. The drawback
is that it depletes 8 health from your health meter each time he spins. Yoshi
can spin up to six consecutive times. I use it when opponents try some wacky
slow-recovery move. That way, I can get behind them and take advantage of
better positioning.

The Low Parry is used to stop an attacking opponents low strike. It's very
effective for halting an opponents momentum. With it's quick recovery time if
missed, the Low Parry can by used generously. The best follow-up for a Low
Parry is probably a throw. I recommend the Rainbow Drop (QCB+1+2) but only if
you can perform it without problems. I find it best to use d+1+3 when I want
to Low Parry. It's simple and quick. Another effective follow-up to the Low
Parry is the Knee Bash (f,f+4). It is unstoppable if done quick enough.

Poison Wind            u/f+3+4             ****           N/A

One of Yoshimitsu's better mid attacks, the Poison Wind is a great move for
stomping opponents who have been knocked down. It also is effective because it
is the begging of a chain of moves. When used correctly, the chains can take
off major damage in juggles, or as oki-zeme.

  = Mini Backhands       = b+1             ***            N/A

The Mini Backhands come out extremely quick which make them very useful for
chipping away health from your opponent. Many times after the Poison Wind, an
opponent will try to retaliate, and end up catching a mini backhand in the
face. One main problem with the mini backhand is that it takes off only a very
small 2 points of health.

    = Big Poison Wind      = 3+4           ***            N/A

The Big Poison Wind chain finisher is handy for finishing off your juggle
combos. It actually takes off more health than the regular Poison Wind which
adds to it's use. The drawbacks are a slow recovery time, and the required
initial chain which must be first executed.

    = Flip Kick            = 4             ***            N/A

The Flip Kick is one of the best moves of this series, just for the fact that
it can get you out of harms way quick. Once the Mini Backhands finish, Yoshi
will Flip Kick backwards. This move actually can hit opponents who try to rush
in and attack after the Mini Backhands. It is also effective because it chains
into an unblockable.

      = Delay Sword          = D/B         ****           N/A

The Delay Sword is just a way to postpone the Sword Slice from coming out, and
make it more damaging. Each additional hop forward adds to the damage that the
Sword Slice will do once it connects. At six and one half hops, the Sword
Slice will take off 100% health from your opponent. You will know it is fully
charged because the sword will smoke. Do not expect to catch your opponents
with the 100% Delayed Sword Slice, because it takes forever to charge up.

        = Sword Slice          = N         *****          {!}

The Sword Slice is great follow-up to the Flip Kick. It hits opponents on the
ground and it is delayable. The damage inflicted varies on how long the Delay
Sword move was used.

The Sword Slice, by itself, is one of Yoshimitsu's greatest weapons. Not only
is it Unblockable, but it hit opponents lying on the ground. It also has great
execution and recovery time. I use the Sword Slice to punish super defensive
players, as well as hit an unsuspecting opponent.

  = Delay Sword          = ~N,D/B          ****           N/A

The Delay Sword is just a way to postpone the Sword Slice from coming out, and

Sword Impale           b,b+1               **             !

The Sword Impale is my least favorite move of Yoshimitsu's. The reasoning
behind this is because it interferes with his gameplay. It's ease of execution
leads to it coming out at the wrong time, like when I dash back and jab punch.
Needless to say, it is still in the game. I do not use it except to switch
into the Spinning Sword. The drawback is a very long execution delay.

  = Spinning Sword       = ~1              ****           !

The Spinning Sword can be used effective as either an Unblockable Shield, or
as a great oki-zeme maneuver. When time is low and I have the upper hand, I
put out the Spinning Sword to protect myself for the final 2 or 3 seconds. It
is also effective against opponents lying on the ground. If you knock them
over, put out a Spinning Sword right above their body. Many times, your
opponent will stand right up into certain damage.

    = Spin Cancel          = b,b           ****           N/A

The Spin Cancel does exactly what is sounds like it does. It cancels the spin
of the Spinning Sword. This is very effective as most players are used to
waiting the duration of the move, then retaliating. This move can give you the 
advantage back by only letting you know if the Spinning Sword will go the full
duration or be cut short (heh a pun!).

Yoshimitsu's Sword Sweep is useful in a sound poking pattern. Since it is an
Unblockable that starts from a crouch, it allows you to change from high to
low attacks, then trip them up semi-quick. The main drawback is that when the
the Sword Sweep misses, it takes a relatively long time to recover. This is
obviously bad news, so be sure to use it only when in close.

Helicopter Leap        U/F+1+2             ***            {!}

The Helicopter Leap is one of Yoshimitsu's aerial Unblockables. He jumps way
into the air, floats for a while, then comes down with a powerful sword. I
hardly ever use the Helicopter Leap without using the Quick Down Slash also. 
The problem with the full Helicopter Leap is the incessant lag time of which
Yoshi suffers from while he is in the air. There is more than enough time for
a wise opponent to run underneath the airborne Yoshi and get a free behind
throw when he lands.

  = Quick Down Slash     = d               ****           {!}

The Quick Down Slash makes the Helicopter Leap worthwhile. It's meant to drop
Yoshimitsu from the Helicopter Leap, into an immediate slash. It is very fast,
and sometimes I use it when I am in the middle of a poking pattern. It's still
a risky move, so you should only use it when you are certain you have a good
chance to inflict damage. It's also relatively good for hitting opponents that
like to stay lying after a knockdown.

The Reverse Helicopter is a decent addition to Yoshimitsu's Unblockable
arsenal. He jumps up as if he was starting the Helicopter Leap, then float
down, then back up and does a 180 degree turn, and finally comes down with a
reverse slice. The problem with the Reverse Helicopter, is that Yoshimitsu can
easily be punched out of it, thus resulting in a juggle for your opponent. The
lag time which Yoshi suffers from while in the air, makes this a very high
risk move.

The Standing Suicide is another of Yoshimitsu's specialty moves. It's only
useful when Yoshi's back is facing the opponent. Yoshi raises his sword, then
stabs himself in the chest. If your opponent is standing close to Yoshi's back
they will take damage. It is best used after a successful Kangaroo Kick juggle
starter, as it will take off huge damage.

  = Spinning Suicide   B+1,1,1...          *              !,DY

The Spinning Suicide hardly causes any damage at all, which makes it more of
a show-off move. It's best used to finish an opponent off, one with a very
small amount of health left.

The Fake Turning Suicide comes out slow and doesn't really add much to Yoshi

The Turning Suicide is a decent move to use against defensive players. Yoshi
turns around and stabs himself in the chest in one big motion. This move can
be deadly not only to your opponent, but to yourself as well. If used at the
wrong time, you will be the only one taking damage. Obviously this is bad. You
definitely don't want to help your opponent beat you, so plan the to use the
Turning Suicide when your health is high, and your opponent's is low.

  = Second Stab          = f,f             ***            !,DY

Sometimes you just have to go for the gusto. The Second Stab is the way to do
it, if you get the win. After the Turning Suicide, Yoshi will stab himself a
second time. This often catches characters that escaped damage from the
initial Turning Suicide, and try to rush up and attack you.

Sword Pogo             u+1+2               *****          {!}

The Sword Pogo is one of Yoshimitsu's most useful moves. It leads into three
other excellent moves, which is one of the reasons it is rated so high. The
Sword Pogo is a great anti-low attack move, as most moves will end up kicking
the exposed sword. It is also an excellent oki-zeme maneuver because of the
relatively large damage it causes.

  = Pogo Rush          [b,b_f,f]           ****           {!}

Not only is the Pogo Rush great for following up the Sword Pogo, it's very
good for running over opponents who like to stay on the ground. The Pogo Rush
can also be performed right after a Pogo Hop.

  = Pogo Hop           [u/b_u_u/f]         ****           {!}

The Pogo Hop is adds the element of risk to the Sword Pogo series. Yoshi jumps
into the air, while still on the sword. The opens up an opportunity for your
opponent to juggle you with some well timed attacks. Even with that, the Pogo
Hop is an excellent follow up to the Sword Pogo.

  = Kangaroo Kick      3+4                 ****           JG


The Kangaroo Kick from the Sword Pogo is the same as the Kangaroo Kick from a

The Death Pose is one of my favorite moves in the entire game. It is also one
of Yoshimitsu's most powerful moves, Unblockable or otherwise. I use it for
many things, one of them being to escape throws. What I mean by this is that
when I see a throw coming, and I have time to react, I quickly go into the
Death Pose. This avoids the throw, and sets up a powerful Bad Breath combo. A
more tricky use of the Death Pose is to avoid an opponent's high poking attack
strings. When you know a set of high punches are coming, or even a string of
moves that ends with a short range high attack, using the Bad Breath to avoid
it is deadly.

  = Bad Breath         ANY                 ******         !

I know, I know... I put six stars instead of five, but I had to. This move
is one of the most useful moves in the entire game. Not only can it be used as
a shield, but it is unblockable, unduckable, uncounterable, and you can start
very high damage juggles from it. Also, it is very quick in it's execution, as
well as recovery, and it lingers during execution. This often can catch an
opponent as they try to rush in and attack too soon. The best use for the Bad
Breath is with a quick dash forward. Most of the time, your opponent will be
worried about a Basic Jab or a quick attack, then be caught in the breath.

The Wood Chopper is a very versatile move. It can be cut short and used for a
quick advancement move. It is an excellent combo finisher. It works great for

pressure attack. When an opponent is attacking with slow moves, I rush in with
the Lunging Foot to counter hit (CH) them, then slam them with the sword,

exposes his sword in front of him for a very short delay, and anything that

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Strings-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yoshimitsu's string attacks are neither the best or worst set of strings in
Tekken 3. There are two basic forms so I split them up into two main groups.
I really only use complete string attacks against the average player, as they
have a hard time escaping them. It becomes a lot more difficult to catch a
good opponent because they know when and how to escape. Even though it's wise
to stay away from using the full strings in a high level match, it's even
smarter to know what Yoshimitsu has, and be ready for it when it comes at you.

-Set 1-

#1) 1,2,1,4,2,2,2,4,1,1
#2) 1,2,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1
#3) 1,2,1,4,4,4,1,4

These are Yoshimitsu's best strings. They start with the Punch-Double Uppercut
and lead into a frenzy of other attacks. The main problem with these sets is
the fourth his in the series, the roundhouse. Any good anti-Yoshi player will
immediately stop the string by ducking the first roundhouse and retaliate with
a Crouching Low Punch (d+1) or a Rising Uppercut (WS+2). Always, and I do mean
always, buffer a Chicken for the first roundhouse. Anyone playing a character
with a Reversal will be tempted to catch the kick. If you do manage to catch
your opponent off guard and sneak the first roundhouse by them, I recommend
continuing with string #2. It's a tad harder to break out of in the latter
stages and it ends with two good Unblockables.

-Set 2-

#4) 4,4,2,2,4,4,1,1,1,1
#5) 4,4,2,2,4,4,1,4
#6) 4,4,2,2,1

These are Yoshimitsu's weaker strings. They start with two high roundhouses
which can easily be crouched under. The roundhouses also come out slow, and a
quick Crouching Low Punch (d+1) can stop them cold. Another drawback of these
strings is that the fourth hit, the backhand, also comes out slow and hits
high. This means it too can also be crouched under and retaliated against. I
usually don't even think of using these strings, but once in a while it isn't
bad to throw them out and see what happens.


==============================================================================
= [7] ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Combos ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: =
==============================================================================

Combos are a major part of Yoshimitsu play. In fact, combos are a major part
of Tekken 3 play in general. When playing as Yoshi at high levels of play, you
must be able to execute his big damage combos consistently, or you will most
likely lose. A combo by definition means "any sequence of hits which are
unblockable after the first hit connects". What this means is, once you start
a combo, your opponent will be unable to do anything but take damage after the
first hit connects.


-Juggling Basics-

With any combo, you need the initial starter. Yoshimitsu has about six basic
ways to start combos. You should know all of these, as they all have very
important uses. The combo starters are:

Command:      Starter Name:        Lev.    Height:        Damage:    Type:

d/f+2         Basic Uppercut       m       medium         ?          Basic
WS+2          Rising Uppercut      m       medium         ?          Basic
4~3           Kangaroo Kick        m       high           30         Basic
FC,d/f+3      Lunging Sweep        L       low            12         Adv.
b+1+2~ANY     Bad Breath           !       low special    30         Adv.
b+1+4         Sword Counter        !       low special    35         Adv.
FC,d/b,b+1    Sword Sweep          !       low special    20         Adv.

The most useful starter is the Basic Uppercut (d/f+2). You have already read
the advantages of the Basic Uppercut, so you know how important it is to good
Yoshi play. The majority of all Yoshimitsu juggles follow d/f+2 because it is
mixed well in poking patterns, and it connects much more than the other juggle
starters. It's also great as a retaliation move, meaning it comes out fast
enough to punish slow-recovery moves. The main thing to remember when using
the basic uppercut is that many anti-Yoshi players expect the d/f+2, and many
times have strategies just to stop it. Make sure you always keep a Chicken
(f+2+4) buffered against Reversal characters. That way, even if your opponent
grabs Yoshi, you can escape unharmed.

The least useful starter is probably the Sword Counter (b+1+4). Even though
the Sword Counter is a very useful move in itself, it is very difficult to
counter with it effectively, without trading hits. On the up side, if you are
quick and brave too, you can run right up next to your opponent and use the
Sword Counter as an Unblockable. From there, you can start your juggle. The
only problem with this is that you need to be right up next to them for the
Sword Counter to hit.

Obviously knowing when and where to use each starter plays an important role
in your victory. Just as important as the juggle starter is the juggle filler.
The juggle filler is the mass of the juggle. Usually a couple of hits before
you finish the combo with a juggle finisher. Since the Tekken 3 juggle engine
is very odd sometimes, allowing many different types of hits to juggle, I will
only list the basic juggle fillers. The basic juggle fillers are:

Command:        Filler Name:          Normal Damage:    Exec:    Recov:

1               Basic Punch           5                 Great    Great
d+1             Crouching Low Punch   ?                 Great    Great
f+2             Backhand              12                Good     Slow
d/f+2           Basic Uppercut        ?                 Good     Good
f,f+3           Lunging Foot          20                Good     Good
f,f+2           Ninja Blade Rush      18                Great    Good
f,f+4           Knee Bash             20                Great    Good
b+1(,1,1)       Stone Fist(s)         10(,10,10)        Great    Great
D/B+2(,2)       Stone Backhand(s)     10(,10)           Good     Slow
d/f+1,2         Uppercut-Backhand     15,12             Good     Slow

The usefulness factor of a juggle filler comes by weighing the execution time
vs the recovery time. The two most useful for Yoshimitsu are the Basic Punch
and the Stone Fists. Both of these moves come out very quick and give you
plenty of time to add in other juggle filler, many times the same move. Some
of the juggle fillers above have a slow recovery time. This doesn't make them
useless, but it does make them harder to utilize. Another good thing about the
slower recovery moves is that they usually do more damage.

The last thing you need for a juggle combo is a finisher. The finisher is the
final hit of your combo, usually a power hit. Juggle finishers basically need
to be fast, damaging, and have good range.

Command:        Finisher Name:        Normal Damage:    Exec:    Range:

d/f+4           Side Kick             ?                 Great    Long
f,f+2           Ninja Blade Rush      18                Great    Long
f,f+4           Knee Bash             20                Great    Long
u/f+4           Jumping Twist Foot    25                Good     Short
b+1+4           Sword Counter         35                Great    Short
u/f+3+4         Poison Wind           10                Good     Medium
f,f+3,1         Wood Chopper          20-18             Good     Medium
u+1+2,f,f       Sword Pogo-Pogo Rush  30-25             Great    Short

On the average, the shorter the range of the finisher, the more damage it will
inflict. This isn't always the case, but generally it's true. By practicing
your juggles you will be able to judge, on the fly, the range you are at after
all filler connects. This is a very important ability because you don't want
to be attempting a short range finisher when you have knocked your opponent
too far. That only results in a low damage combo. I recommend to start off by
finishing your combos with the Side Kick (d/f+4) as it has the best range and
it's very quick. Then move to the Knee Bash (f,f+4), then onto some of the
more complicated finishers, i.e. Wood Chopper (f,f+3,1) and Sword Pogo-Pogo
Rush (u+1+2,f,f).


-Unconventional Juggling-

Once you understand the fundamentals of the Tekken 3 combo system, you can
move into the more advanced style of juggles. Unconventional juggles can be
started a few different ways. The first way is with a regular juggle starter
which knocks and opponent low or low special. These starters do not act like
the typical juggle starter because they don't launch the opponent into the
air. The second style of Unconventional juggle is an anti-air juggle. What
this means is you actually knock your opponent out of the air during one of
their attacks. This is definitely more difficult to execute than the normal
Basic juggles, but can become quite easy with a bit of practice.


-Combo List-

I have tried to separate the easy juggles with the more difficult ones, giving
a difficulty rating for each juggle. The rating system is exactly like the
move description ratings except for the addition of half stars. Keep in mind
that some juggles may be easier or harder for you than myself and these are
based on my experience only. With that, onto the juggles.

The damage for each juggle is not listed yet because there is not way I can
accurately get the damage for each juggle. Perhaps when the home version comes
out I can add the damage. I almost might just rate each juggle's damage factor
like I did the other categories.

Style points simply signify the "coolness" of a certain juggle in my opinion.
A 1 signifies a non stylish juggle, and a 5 signifies the most stylish. Many
times, when presented a juggle opportunity, I opt for the stylish combos. =)

= [8] ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Basic Strategy ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: =
==============================================================================

Well now that all the moves have been explained, and you have a grasp of how
the juggle system works, it's time to learn how to actually use it all. In
this section I will cover the absolute basic requirements for good Yoshimitsu
play. If you are new to Tekken 3, or Yoshi for that matter, I suggest you read
and learn the following section. If you are a more experienced Yoshi/Tekken 3
player, you might already know most of this. Of course, it doesn't hurt to
check it out anyway.


-Defense-

Blocking is the probably the most important part of any fighting game. Since
the goal of the game is to inflict as much damage on your opponent before time
expires, it's a good idea to know how to guard against your opponent. Blocking
requires good hand-eye coordination as well as a fair bit of anticipation. A
good defense uses offensive elements in the place of basic blocking, which can
give you the offensive advantage when used correctly. Side stepping is also an
effective defense tactic. Using a side step to avoid an attack can give you
a major advantage over your opponent. The last major part of a good Yoshimitsu
defense is his Low Parry (d+1+3). Momentum is a major factor in Tekken 3, and
when you become effective at switching the momentum to your attack whenever
your opponent is on the attack, you will have a much easier time inflicting
damage.

Interrupting is a very important part of Tekken 3. The most common technique
is the basic couching low punch (d+1). The low punch is excellent for breaking
an opponents chains and can be followed up with a Rising Front Kick (WS+4). A
smart Yoshi player will interrupt strings and attacks with the low punch, then
follow up with the rising kick, making sure to buffer a Chicken (f+2+4) when
playing a reversal character. Another good interrupt is Yoshi's Knee Bash. Its
execution time is very and with the higher damage factor its uses quickly
appear. The drawback is the lag time, which follows a blocked Knee.

Another defensive tactic is to avoid oncoming attacks altogether via side
step (u_d,n). Many players have good attacking patterns which, when read
right, can prove to be more of a setback than an advantage. Proper times to
side step obviously differ between each opponent because of individual moves.
Sometimes, even random side stepping can be useful and confusing. When mixed
in with dashes, your opponent can sometimes be provoked into attacking, thus
giving you the advantage.

The Low Cancel (d+1+3) is used in place of blocking, and many times can prove
to be more effective. When an opponent attacks low and you parry their attack,
Yoshimitsu will push them aside. This is an excellent defense tactic because
once your opponent is parried, you gain the advantage. Many times I just go
for a throw follow-up, but other times I attempt a Bad Breath. The reason both
of these techniques are effective is because an opponent who gets reversed
often is afraid of being juggled, so they hold straight back. Obviously throws
grab standing opponents, and the Bad Breath hits anything in range. Sometimes
I just go for a low kick (d+4) to push my opponent back.


-Positioning-

Positioning is a very important part of basic Yoshimitsu gameplay. With the
additions of side steps to Tekken 3, you can virtually end up in any position
in relation to your opponent. Knowing what to do when an opportunity arises is
crucial to high level gameplay success. There are 5 basic positions which can
come up any time during a game. These are: In Close; Dash Range; Far; Side;
and Behind. 


:In Close:

In close is exactly what is sounds like. In close constitutes anything inside
Front Kick (d/f+4) range, which means if the Front Kick can hit your opponent,
you are in close. This is Yoshi's strongest position in front of the opponent.
Most all of Yoshimitsu's "custom strings" start from this position. Custom
strings are explained in the Advanced Strategy section.


:Dash Range:

Dash range is about one dash away from your opponent. Dash range is a very
strong position for Yoshi because of his excellent advancing moves. At this
range you can dash in (f,f), use a Knee Bash (f,f+4) or a Lunging Foot (f,f+3)
to get close while attacking, or play the keep-away game. The keep-away game
will also be explained in the Advanced Strategy Section.


:Far:

Far is another no-brainer. If you are far enough from your opponent to where
running is an option to get close (f,f from more than 3 character widths) then
you are obviously far. From this distance Yoshi doesn't have much in the way
of attacking. I usually run up into dash range then immediately cut the run
short. Sometimes an opponent will charge at you from this range, many times a
simple Helicopter Leap will get you out of harms way.


:Side:

Side is when you are on the either side of your opponent. This can be achieved
on of two ways: by you initiating it with a side step (u_d,n); by stopping an
opponents attack before it completes, thus leaving you at a different angle.
In both cases the side throw is usually the best option as it is a guaranteed
40 points of damage if it connects. Other more risky options include: a side
step in attempt to get into the Behind position; an attempt to damage via a
juggle or a power move; and an evasive fake. The evasive fake is an Advanced
Strategy and will be explained in that section.


:Behind:

Probably the most desired and coveted position by many Tekken 3 players, the
Behind position usually seen more by Yoshimitsu players. This is because he
has the Backhand (f+2), the Uppercut-Backhand (d/f+1,2), the Spinning Evade
(b+3+4 up to 6x), and the Teleport (Sit, b_f). Each of these moves have some
ability which causes Yoshi to gain the Behind position. Usually the best thing
to do in the Behind position is go for the throw. This is an easy 70 damage
and is inescapable once initiated. You can also go for the damage attempt, or
use the evasive fake which is described in the Advanced Strategy section.


Having good positioning is key to high level play. Being able to manipulate
various situations to your advantage can be the difference between winning and
losing. With proper use of side steps, dashes, and turn around moves, Yoshi
can be anywhere at any time.


-Throwing-

Throwing is such a basic part of Tekken 3 play, you not only need to know how
to utilize it correctly, but also defend against it. To both use and defend
against throws you need to have a basic idea of your opponents skill. First of
all, can your opponent even throw on command? Does your opponent use non-basic
throws? Knowing these facts can really help your throwing game. If you find
that your opponent can't even throw themselves, you will more than likely have
an easy time tossing them around at your leisure. If you notice your opponent
uses non-basic throws, and escapes throws efficiently, you need to think about
switching up your basic throws, and adding the Rainbow Drop (qcb+1+2). On the
whole, it's all about reading your opponent. Don't give them the chance to
surprise you. Always play a top level throwing game. Switch up between both
basic throws and the Rainbow Drop, and remember to keep yourself safe from
getting thrown. When you are in throw range, be sure to attack and cover up
your opponents possible throw opportunities. One other thing about throwing:
"Throwing is not cheap!". Live with it...


==============================================================================
= [9] ::::::::::::::::::::::::: Advanced Strategy :::::::::::::::::::::::::: =
==============================================================================

By now you should have a decent grasp on Yoshimitsu's moves, combos, and basic
elements of gameplay. This section covers much more advanced styles of play,
which will constitute the greater portion of your Yoshimitsu play. By adding
you own style to the following techniques and styles, you will really begin to
develop your own Yoshimitsu.


-Custom Strings-

Custom strings are one of the hardest parts of Yoshimitsu to master. At high
levels of gameplay, a good custom string can be what separates you from the
rest of the pack. Since many people have no idea what a custom string is, let
me explain. A custom string is a series of quick moves in which, when used
together, make it very difficult for your opponent to do much of anything
besides blocking. This isn't as easy as it sounds though, because putting a
few moves together one after another doesn't make an effective custom string.
You must create your custom strings to be quick and very unreadable. Most
custom strings are more useful than real strings because of their speed and
lack of major delay between moves. Some people refer to custom strings as
"patterns" but this is a general misconception. Patterns can easily be spotted
which in turn can be easily defended against. A true custom string has many
alternatives, making it very hard to defend against and at the same time they
often force your opponent into making unwise decisions.

Creating a custom string takes experimentation and practice. Many moves can be
executed one after another with little or no delay time, thus making them more
effective as custom string additions. A great example of two moves that flow
together effectively are the Crouching Low Punch (d+1) to Rising Front Kick
(WS+4). The Crouching Low Punch has almost zero recovery time and the Rising
Front Kick has excellent execution time. Add these together are you have the
most basic custom string in Tekken 3. A bad example would be a Low Kick (d+3)
to a Roundhouse (4). Both moves have delayed execution times and with the
extended lag time of standing up before the Roundhouse, it's obvious why these
two moves do not flow well together. A good practice for creating your own
custom strings is to vary up the hit ranges. Hitting mid range is essential
because your opponent cannot duck the hits. Hitting low is important because
your opponent must block. Try to avoid constantly attacking high because your
opponent can easily duck and retaliate. A good set of high attacks can be very
useful though, so don't drop them altogether. When used all in one tightly
wrapped package, a custom string can completely frustrate your opponent

The effectiveness of a custom string relies on three things: position; speed;
and variation. The importance of speed and variation have already been
explained so I will briefly comment on position. If you have read the Basic
Strategy section, you know that Yoshimitsu's most effective range is In Close.
This is because most of his quick moves have relatively short range. Once you
get into position you need to know how to maintain it. Yoshimitsu has a few
great moves for advancing while attacking. These are essential for keeping
your custom string going. If you use a short burst of moves which contain no
forward momentum, you have basically created a gap between you and your
opponent, thus losing position. The success of a custom string can be judged
on how well it flows together, how long you can maintain it, and how much
damage it causes or sets up. Remember to keep this in mind when you create a
string. What is the purpose of this string? Do you want to separate yourself
from your opponent? Do you want to continuously bombard your opponent with
quick attacks. Or are you trying to set up a throw? Having a goal for a
particular string is a very important factor to know as you create custom
strings.

You should have a general idea about the uses of a custom string, as well as
the different factors involved when creating one. Now I will explain Yoshi's
major custom string moves, as well as put them in an easy to read format.


Forward Momentum Moves:             Stationary Moves:

d/f+1,2                             d/f+4
d/f+2                               WS+4
1,2                                 d+1
b+1                                 WS+2
                                    1

These moves are the ones most used in Yoshimitsu's custom strings. The each
have one of two basic properties. They either: move Yoshimitsu forward during
execution; or keep him stationary during execution. If you want your custom
string to keep on the attack, then it's wise to have a bigger percentage of
forward momentum moves. If you wish to separate yourself from your opponent,
then a couple of quick stationary moves will do the trick.

Let's look at a very basic custom string which I use a lot. This is a cross
between forwards momentum and stationary. I use it to attack in a quick short
burst, then push me away to safety.

1, d+1, WS+4, d/f+4

My main custom string starts with the the quick Basic Punch. It creates enough
block stun against your opponent which lets you immediately go into the next
hit, the low punch. Since the Crouching Low Punch is one of the fastest
executing and recovering moves in the game, the Rising Front Kick is an
excellent follow-up. The Rising Front Kick will separate you and your opponent
far enough for you to safely throw out a Side Kick. This is one of the most
effective basic strings for Yoshi because of its ease of execution and the
fact that it only contains one high attack. Many times your opponent will try
to foolishly attack in between the hits, thus taking damage.

Obviously this isn't a combo, but it designed to force your opponent to block
or take damage. Each part of the string flows well together making it very
difficult for your opponent to attack. Usually an opponent will be enticed to
attack after the Rising Front Kick and end up eating the Side Kick. This is
great for you because when the Side Kick interrupts attacks, it tends to do
major damage.

If you want a longer string, you can switch up a few of the moves and end up
with a never ending custom string.

1, d/f+2, 1, d+1, WS+1, 1, d/f+2, 1, d+1, WS+1...

This string is basically the same small string repeated multiple times. It
starts with the Basic Punch, then a Basic Uppercut follows. The Uppercut has
a little bit of a start up time, but the fact that Yoshi ducks down as he
performs it makes up for it. The custom string then goes back into a Basic
Punch, then a Crouching Low Punch. The final hit of the initial string is a
Rising Uppercut. Then the string flows seamlessly back into itself, making it
a very useful infinite custom string. The drawback of infinite custom strings
is that your opponent will begin to recognize in, then develop solutions to
escape. A great advantage to this string is its juggle potential. With the
Basic Uppercut thrown in, if your opponent is lured into attacking at the
wrong time, the will find themselves in the middle of getting juggled. Since
there is never more than one high attack strung together, this is an effective
string to use against opponents who like to crouch a lot. One obvious problem
with this string is it doesn't ever attack low. Then again, it was designed to
constantly bombard your opponent with hits with the intention of catching them
with a juggle starter in between.

Maybe you want to set up a juggle combo. Using custom strings to train your
opponent to block is a super effective tool for Yoshi because he has the very
powerful Unblockable Bad Breath. As you know, this move can start some great
juggles even against blocking opponents. A simple, yet effective Bad Breath
set-up string is:

1, b+1, 1, dash forward B+1+2~ANY

Simple, yet effective. Conditioning your opponent to block with a constant
barrage of custom strings is essential for this string to work. Once your
opponent is afraid to attack, they will be hesitant to attack when you dash in
and start the Bad Breath. Once they realize what is about to happen it is
usually to late and they end up caught in a Bad Breath juggle.

The same effect can be produced with:

1, dash forward B+1+2~ANY

Basically this is the same thing as above without the first two attacks. It is
great for interrupting an opponents attacks as well. Usually, when you stop
one of their attacks with a Basic Punch, they immediately go into a defensive
mode. This opens up an opportunity to go right into the breath.

Another great way to set up juggles is to mix in a bunch of Basic Uppercuts
into your string. Here is a string which I use to lure opponents into walking
right into a juggle.

d/f+4, d/f+2, 1, d/f+4, d/f+2, 1...

The Side Kick puts some distance between you and your opponent. The Basic
Uppercut brings you back towards your opponent. The Basic Punch is used to set
up the Side Kick. It's a great custom string for setting up juggles because
many opponents think the Side Kick has a slow recovery time, which isn't true.
They usually end up walking into the Uppercut and taking a bunch of juggle
damage.

Since Yoshimitsu can start juggles from a crouch via his nifty Lunging Sweep
(FC,d/f+3), there is no reason you can't use it in custom strings. In fact,
most of the Yoshimitsu players I know utilize it in some form of string. My
most used Lunging Sweep custom string is usually some form of the two below:

1, d+1, FC,d/f+3

1, d+1, WS+4, d+1, FC,d/f+3

Basically the Lunging Sweep always follows the Crouching Low Punch. The first
string is a very quick version of a Lunging Sweep custom string. The second
example uses the popular Low Punch to Rising Kick string in between. Both of
these strings are effective, but suffer a very dangerous side effect. If the
Lunging Sweep is blocked, then Yoshimitsu is susceptible to some heavy damage.
The best times to use either of these strings are when you have conditioned
your opponent into blocking high. This is accomplished by using custom strings
with many mid attacks and very few low attacks.

You now know what a custom string is, and the many uses for them. You should
definitely create some of your own to fit in with your own style. I have made
a list of some of my most used custom strings for you to try out. Since each
of these strings are variations of the major ones described above, I won't
bother explaining them all.

1, d+1, WS+4, d/f+4
1, 1, d+1, WS+4, d/f+4
1, 1, d/f+4, d/f+2

d/f+2, d/f+2, 1, d/f+2...
d/f+2, d/f+2, d+1 WS+4, d/f+4
d/f+2, 1, b+1, 1, d/f+2...

d/f+4, d/f+2, 1, d+1, WS+4
d/f+4, d/f+2, d/f+1,2,d/b+2,2 d+1, WS+4

f,f+2, d+1, WS+4, d/f+4
f,f+2, 1, 1,2, d+1, WS+4, d/f+4


These are just a small amount of the custom strings I use in my matches. They
should give you an idea of how I string them together, and give you ideas on
how to create your own.


-Buffering Chickens-

To effectively reverse ("chicken") your opponents Reversals, you must first
understand how to do it. It's very simple really. If your opponent reverses
one of your left limbs then you Chicken with f+1+3. If your opponent reverses
one of your right limbs you Chicken with f+2+4. If a double limbed attack is
reversed, such as a Kangaroo Kick or a Shark Attack, then you can Chicken with
either f+1+3 or f+2+4. Now that we have that out of the way, let's take a look
at Yoshimitsu's most commonly reversed moves. They are:

d/f+2
1,2,1,4 (last two hits)
WS+4
WS+2
3,4
d/f+1,2
d/b+3,3(,3,3,3),f+4 (last hit)
d/f+1,1,1,1 (last two hits)

I am sure these aren't the only moves that will be reversed, but they are the
most common. Buffering a Chicken requires some quick hands and a little bit of
practice. Let's take the Side Kick (d/f+4) for example. To buffer the Chicken
for the Side Kick, immediately press f+2+4 after performing the d/f+4 motion.
Both motions should be as one and done fluidly. If your opponent tries to
reverse your Side Kick, Yoshimitsu will have a stored Chicken and break out of
it automatically. If your opponent doesn't reverse, you can go on with your
match. Buffering is a very advanced technique which requires some experience.
Once you can successfully buffer all of your reverse-prone moves, your game
will greatly improve.

One important side note: You cannot escape King's reversals. So buffering a
Chicken for your kicks is not necessary.


-Yoshimitsu's Oki-zeme-

Oki-zeme is a Japanese term which basically means "to place pressure a downed
opponent". This is loosely translated I suppose, but it is what most players
recognize the word to mean. Many players think of hitting a downed or rising
opponent as being "cheap" or "unfair" which is really not the case. Just as
slikatel pointed out in his guide, in a real street fight, when someone goes
down, you don't let up until it's over. This relates to Tekken 3 as well. When
you knock your opponent down, you want to keep them down as long as possible
in order to inflict as much damage as you can. Yoshi's most useful moves for
keeping your opponent on the ground and/or damaging them while they are down
are as follows:

d+3
d+4
d/b+1
d/b+3...
u/f+1+2~D
u/f+3+4...
u+1+2,f,f
f,f+3,1
b,b+1~1

Yoshimitsu has quite an oki-zeme arsenal as you can see. Usually when I knock
an opponent down with Yoshi, I try to tack on a couple more hits instead of
trying to keep them down. The best move for this is probably the Crouching Low
Kick (d+3). Most of the times after I finish a juggle, I try to sneak in this
extra hit because it hits both rolling and lying opponents. I also like to
switch up with the Low Side Kick (d+4). This is another great move for hitting
opponents who like to roll, and many times you can run up and add on the
Crouching Low Kick.

If your opponent just stays down after a knockdown, waiting to see what you do
next, go into the Sword Pogo (u+1+2), then the Pogo Rush (f,f). These two
moves take of a ton of damage and are both great ground strikes. The Pogo Rush
even damages opponents which like to roll backwards or forwards.

If you are unsure of what your opponent might do after a knockdown, don't be
afraid to use one of the Poison Wind (u/f+3+4...) variations. The initial move
will stomp any opponents lying on the ground, and sometimes can catch them as
they attempt a roll. The advantage of using one of the Poison Wind variations
is the fact that if you miss, you can backflip to safety. If you do connect
with the initial hit, you can then continue with the Mini Backhand into the
Big Poison Wind. Since the Big Poison Wind takes even more damage than the
first one, connecting with this string can be very deadly to your opponents
health.

A risky but damaging oki-zeme strike is the Helicopter Leap-Quick Down Slash
(u/f+1+2~D). This move takes of a considerable amount of damage at 25 points,
but can really get you into a bind if your opponent rolls forward. I hardly
ever use this technique but it effective against a mediocre opponent.

The Spinning Low Sweeps (d/b+3...) have always been a great oki-zeme tool. In
Tekken 2, almost all of the kicks would connect on a lying opponent. In Tekken
3 they have toned it down so that only the first hit connects. I commonly use
the Spinning Low Sweeps in places I would use the Crouching Low Kick (d+3).

A very effective/high-powered oki-zeme tactic is the Wood Chopper (f,f+3,1).
This move is great against opponents that like to roll forwards or backwards
after a knockdown, but is also good against opponents which lie still. The
Lunging Foot (f,f+3) can catch the opponent as they roll which makes the next
part guaranteed. The only drawback of this oki-zeme tactic is the fact that
opponents can avoid the damage with a roll to the side.

The Spinning Sword (b,b+1~1) is another great move for pressuring a rising
opponent. If you put out the Spinning Shield above your opponents lying body,
many times they will stand up into it and take damage. Even if they try to
attack as they rise, they will take damage. You must make sure to perform the
Spinning Sword quickly, or it loses it's effectiveness.

Perhaps the most effective oki-zeme move is the Sword Slice (d/b+1). Since it
is one of Yoshimitsu's many Unblockables, your opponent has little defense for
it while they are lying on the ground or rising. The only way your opponent
can avoid being struck with the Sword Slice is to roll to the side, and even
some of the best players tend forget rolling sideways.


-The Keep-Away Game-

Playing the Keep-Away game is much different than playing a strictly defensive
or offensive game. Basically it entails making your opponent come to you and
you running away or pushing them back. The reason this is technique can be
effective is because, when your opponent is coming at you, they can't block. I
sometimes use this play style when I play against high level competition, but
it is more effective against the mediocre player. To play the keep-away game
you have to take risks, it's as simple as that. Going for high-risk moves as
your opponent rushes you is what it's all about. The most common moves I use
for my keep-away game are as follows:

d/f+4
f,f+4
u/f+4
U/F+1+2~B
4~3
B+3+4 (up to 6x)
Sit, [b_f]

Both the Knee Bash (f,f+4) and the Jumping Twist Foot (u/f+4) I use to smash
my opponent as they rush in. The risk factor here is that if your opponent
does block them, they can retaliate and damage you instead.

I use the Side Kick (d/f+4) to stop an opponent dead in their tracks. Many
times I catch them right as they attack and I cause some major damage. The
risk factor here is that is your opponent is out of range and doesn't get hit
with the Side Kick, they can dash in and punish you before your Side Kick
retracts.

When opponents are far and they try to run in and slam me with a shoulder butt
or slide, I go for the Reverse Helicopter (U/F+1+2~B). This is very effective
because many times your opponents with go right underneath you, and you will
end up coming down on them from behind. The drawback of using the Reverse
Helicopter is that you can end up with your back to your opponent if they can
anticipate the Reverse Helicopter, then stop their charge prematurely.

The Kangaroo Kick (4~3) is used against opponents who like to rush in and go
for a slow executing high attack. The Kangaroo Kick will go under their attack
and set up a very large damage combo opportunity. Again, if your opponent cuts
their rush short, you can end up whiffing the Kangaroo Kick, thus allowing
your opponent to take a free shot at you.

Both the Spinning Evade (B+3+4 up to 6x) and the Teleport (Sit, b_f) are used
to get away from your opponent and change your positioning. When an opponent
rushes in, the Spinning Evade can avoid all attacks and sometimes even place
you behind your opponent. The Teleport is used more to lure your opponent into
coming at you, so you can Teleport behind them at hit them for free.

I am sure you can come up with Keep-Away uses for many of Yoshimitsu's moves,
but I just wanted to give you a basic idea of how the Keep-Away game is played
and which moves I use when I utilize the technique. Again, if you do not like
taking risks I suggest you stay away from this play style. You can get into
some really dangerous predicaments when you throw out wild moves as your
opponent attacks, sometimes causing major damage to you instead.


-Tricks of the Trade-

Yoshimitsu has some very effective tricks and techniques used by the some of
the top players. Usually tricks involve ways to use certain of moves together
to confuse your opponent and cause damage. Others are used for making regular
moves more effective. Knowing all the little nuances of Yoshimitsu can really
help your style and make you an all-around killer.


:Low Parry to Breath:

Exactly as the name implies, this technique consists of first parrying a low
attack, then using the Bad Breath (B+1+2~ANY). This is a deadly tactic because
when opponents have a low attack parried, they usually worry about being hit
or thrown so they block. Since the Bad Breath is unblockable, it will hit your
opponent whether or not they are blocking back or crouching, thus setting up a
big damage combo. To successfully use this technique, I suggest using a tiny
dash towards your opponent immediately after you parry their low attack. This
will bring you in range and also make your opponent weary of attempting an
attack.


:Jaw Smash to Free Hit:

Since Yoshimitsu's Jaw Smash (2+4) throw keeps him near his opponent after he
knocks them down, it is possible for Yoshi to add on extra damage before the
opponent has any chance to escape. The first move which connects is the basic
Crouching Low Kick (d+3). The second, more powerful, follow-up is the Sword
Pogo-Pogo Rush (u+1+2,f,f). Many times this Pogo Rush will hit twice, making
the Jaw Smash a very powerful throw. One thing to remember is that, if you use
this technique too much, your opponent will catch on and begin to escape the
initial throw.


:Jaw Smash to Go Behind:

Another great trick to use after a Jaw Smash (2+4) involves sidestepping
towards your opponents head after the Jaw Smash connects, then using quick
pokes to keep them from rising the correct way. Basically, if you connect with
the Jaw Smash, sidestep towards your opponents head, then use a basic low
punch (d+1), immediately followed by a rising right kick (WS+4) then repeat
the pattern until one of the attacks hits. If your opponent tries to stand up
or attack from this position, you will punch/kick them out of the attack and
their back will be towards you. I suggest using a Knee Bash (f,f+4) if the
rising kick connects, and a rising kick, then Knee Bash if the low punch
connects.


:Lunging Foot to Crouching Attacks:

Another confusing set-up attack is the Lunging Foot (f,f+3). Since it recovers
low (RC) you can smoothly flow into any move which starts as FC. The best part
about using the Lunging Front Kick as a low move set-up is because most of the
time your opponent will be worried about the Sword Slice follow-up and they
will stand up. This gives you and opportunity to strike with a Lunging Low
Sweep (FC,d/f+3) or a Sword Sweep (FC,d/b,b+1). Both moves are good because
they cause some good damage. The drawback is the fact that if either move is
defended against correctly, Yoshimitsu is open to some damage.


:Lunging Sweep Combo to Wakeup Breath:

A very tricky and nasty tactic to use when your opponent tech rolls a combo
which leaves you close is to immediatly dash then Bad Breath (b+1+2~ANY). One
of the best setups for this particular trick is: first catch your opponent
with a Lunging Sweep (FC,d/f+3), then use a rising kick (WS+4), immediately
followed by a basic low kick (d+4). As soon as the basic low kick connects,
dash right up to your opponent and Bad Breath. Many times you will catch them
off guard and score a high-damage combo.


:Dash Buffered Attacks:

Dash buffering attacks is nothing more than using a dash forwards (f,f) then
adding a move onto the end of it. The best example I can give is the Dash to
Knee Bash (f,f,f+4). As you can see, when using the dash with a Knee Bash on
the end you have combined both moves to form one smooth motion. What makes
this technique useful is the fact that you can cover larger distances before
you attack.


:Delayed Door Knocker:

Using the wait-delay feature of the Door Knocker (d/f+1,1,1,1) you can often
make your opponent walk right into damage. I have found that by delaying the
third hit, it yields the best results. This is probably due to the fact that
opponents don't realize what is going on for the first two hits so they end up
blocking. Then once they realize that you are using the Door Knocker they know
what to expect so when you delay the third hit they sometimes think the Door
Knocker is finished. When they try to attack they end up finding out you were
not done with the Door Knocker and they take damage. Experiment with different
delay times and places to use the delay, you might find better places to use
it effectively.

Another great trick to use with the Door Knocker is to cut it short after the
first two hits, then throw. By siwtching up between using the full four hits
of the Wood Chopper, and cutting it short for a throw in between, you can keep
your opponent guessing.


-Controlling the Game-

Controlling the game is a very hard thing to explain. Basically it involves
you making your opponent do exactly what you want them to do, when you want
them to do it. This is a very hard thing to do, especially at high levels of
gameplay, but it can be done. The most important factor is being able to read
your opponent. Do they have any predictable patterns? Do they always try to
throw after you do a certain move? When do they go for juggles? In addition to
knowing all that, you have to learn how they react to your attacks and actions
each time you do something. Does your opponent block this consistently? Does
your opponent now how to escape this throw? Knowing all this can be a great
advantage if you pick it up quick enough.

Once you get to the point where you know what your opponent is going to do
after one of your attacks or actions, you must learn to exploit it. If your
opponent always rushes in after a Rising Front Kick (WS+4), go for a grab, or
slam them with a Side Kick (d/f+4). If your opponent always pokes you two or
three times, then goes for a juggle attempt, use a Crouching Low Punch (d+1).
The tactics above aren't guaranteed to work 100%, but when you find some that
do, use them. Frustrating your opponent is very important. Once they feel like
they have nothing they can do, you have won the game. When they get to the
point where they are afraid to use their own tactics, you have basically shut
them down, giving you free reign over the match.

Now, if this actually happens to you, don't worry. Step back and play it safe
for a few seconds. Try something you don't normally do. I mean, if you already
have lost hope in winning, then why not try something new? Sometimes this is
the key to getting out of the rut. The mental part of Tekken 3 is extremely
important and you must learn to play it well.

==============================================================================

Now that you know what Yoshimitsu can and can't do, it's time to develop your
own style of play. You have learned all about his moves, his combos, ways to
create and utilize custom strings, and lots of really effective strategy. As
slikatel pointed out in his guide, I can't tell you exactly how to play. That
is something you have to find out for yourself through practice. I developed
my style through tons of practice and constant experimentation. Take your time
to learn everything you can about your character. If you think up something
new to try, write it down and take it to the arcade and see what happens. 


-Offensive vs Defensive-

This is still one of the biggest questions regarding Tekken 3 play. Should I
play defensive? Or should I play offensive? The answer to this lies in how you
perform with each style. If you win more by playing defensive, then play a
defensive game. If you win more by staying on the attack, then attack for all
your worth and a little bit more. My recommendation is to make sure you know
both facets of play. You can't do much against an opponent who is a defensive
player when you yourself are one. Also, if your opponent is a great attacker
like yourself, yet you aren't very experienced at defending, then you are in
big trouble. Generally though, at high levels of play, only those with both a
strong defense and offense will succeed. 


-Taking Risks-

Risk taking is a very important aspect of high level play. In my experience,
only those players who take the final step and put everything on the line for
a victory are those who who win consistently against the best competition. I
am not saying you can't win by playing it safe, because that would be untrue.
A sound no-risk defense and offense can be quite effective. In my opinion
though, I do think that taking risks can open up your eyes and help you learn
new ways of dealing with different situations. Try using moves in places you
would never normally try them in a really serious match. I mean, go for an
unblockable during an opponents string, throw out a random Kangaroo Kick, try
using jumping attacks to escape odd situations. This is only the tip of the
iceberg, but I am sure you understand my point. Many times you will find a
great new technique that you can incorporate into your style of play.

To be consistent and sound, is to be good... to be unpredictable and creative,
is to be great...

==============================================================================

Well this is basically the end of the guide. If you are a novice Yoshi player
or just starting out, you should probably read this guide a couple more times,
trying to learn a few new things each time. Be sure to get all his moves down
and be able to perform them on call. Then make sure you can juggle with decent
proficiency and consistency. Once you have the general Yoshimitsu gameplay
under control, work on your own style of play. If you are an intermediate to
advanced Yoshimitsu player, I hope you have learned at least one or two things
new from reading this guide. The sole purpose of this guide is to make you a
better player. Since there is always something new to learn, this guide can't
possibly list everything there is to Yoshimitsu. I can only hope I have given
an accurate representation of his abilities. Remember... have fun! - Ben

-Yoshimitsu's Story-

Boskonovitch created the Cold Sleep machine during experiments in his search
for eternal life. The technology, still unproven, was used to preserve his
young daughter who suddenly passed away. 

Yoshimitsu raises research funds and as the leader of the "Manji" party he
helps the poor and disadvantaged. Yoshimitsu visited Boskonovitch when he
learned of the many martial artist disappearances. The "Yo-man" was surprised
to find Boskonovitch suffering from a mysterious pathological organism. It's
believed to have been contracted during lab experiments while making the Cold
Sleep machine. Like some weird sci-fi story, Boskonovich claims he needs blood
from the God of Fighting to complete his research and bring his daughter back
to life. Indebted to Boskonovitch for saving his life, Yoshimitsu enters the
tournament to help an old friend.
