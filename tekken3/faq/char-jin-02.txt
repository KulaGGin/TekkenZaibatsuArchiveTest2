|Updated|

Many things in the world of Tekken 3 have happened since this guide was
published 9 months ago. During that time I had other priorites that
warranted my attention so that is the reason this guide has never been
updated until now. Recent events have lead me to update this guide once
again, as well as fix the errors that I had known about for some time. Many
things have been added including a much larger and more advanced combo
section. Quite a few new Jin combos have been found since I originally wrote
this guide so you will definately see some new things, some that might even
surprise you. I have listed below what has been added or changed but I urge
you to read the guide from start to finish once again to make sure you don't
miss any new information that might have gone unnoticed. The added sections
are easy to point out but I went through the guide from top to bottom and made
a lot of changes here and there so you might not catch them unless you read
through from the beginning.

Also, due to the shutdown of Tekken.Net, our host wasn't very happy about our
bandwith and hard disk usage, it might be a bit tough for this guide to be
introduced back into the Tekken 3 community. Since there are no current plans
to revive Tekken.Net on a new server I might build a small page if only to
hold this guide and perhaps a few movies to coincide with it. Some of the
combos in this guide are extremely difficult, and some may not make sense
until they are witnessed live so I am thinking about making some movies as a
helper to this guide. Be sure to keep your eyes open incase I go forward and
actually do it. Enough rambling though, time to enjoy the update.


Just what has been updated?


Fixes:

-All the Electric Wind Godfist information has been corrected and more has
 been added to uncloud all of the mysteries surrounding this move.
-Many terms have been updated to their newer more universal names.
 For example "low cancel" has been changed to "low parry", and "quick rise"
 has been changed to "tech roll". There are a few others.
-Many sections have been updated with new information including some of the
 move descriptions so again I stress you read this guide from start to finish
 to catch all of the changes.
-The Chicken Buffering section is now more in depth and explains the
 technique much better.

Additions:

-Lots of new juggles including dive stun juggles, electric guard juggles,
 flipover juggles and plenty of new expert level ones including the most
 damaging Jin combo found yet.
-A tactics section has been added to advanced strategy. It only holds one
 tactic for now but hopefully I will be adding some more soon.
-Elecric Guard combo setups was added to tricks of the trade.
-The Super Hop Kick and Hopping Stun Kick were added to the move list and
 move description sections.
-4 new tricks have been added to the Tricks of the Trade section.

*Prologue*

Before we get started I want to explain the focus of this guide. It does not
contain strategies for defeating the computer opponents nor does it have
patterns for finishing the game in record time. It is directed towards the
beginning Jin player or the seasoned Jin player who might be looking for
some fresh insight from another experienced player. The strategy and tactics
contained in this guide are also geared towards good to excellent
competition. If all you have in your area are beginners and button mashers
then this faq probably won't do you any good. It's ironic that high level
strategy is worthless against mashers, but it's simply because they don't
fully understand the logistics of the game and usually just try to keep
attacking regardless of what you do. Against mashers and beginners you can
usually win with a small foray of moves that will catch them when they are
open. However if you try to use high level strategy meant to trick your
usual level of opponents, the beginner/masher won't even have the slightest
clue and will probably ruin the whole setup by an off the wall attack or by
being hit before you finish with the setup. While in a sense it shows how
important variety is, the fact of them escaping certain death or hitting you
with an off the wall move is due to luck not skill. Therefore 9 times out of
10 if you tried to repeat what they did you would fail. However on a final
note, don't always count a button masher as completely worthless. Sometimes
their luck is a gateway to a new escape or counter that was never thought of
before. They obviously won't see it, but you the good player will and can
pick it up right away.

With that said let's get on with the guide...

*Introduction to Jin Kazama*
****************************

Jin Kazama is arguably one of the most dangerous characters thus far in
Tekken 3. His speed and power allow him to do large amounts of damage in
little time. He relies on his ability to juggle opponents and keep them on
the defense with a barrage of quick attacks. Jin is far from perfect however
as he is missing some very useful attacks or specialties that other
characters have. The most important thing to remember with Jin is that when
used correctly he can be quite devastating, but in the wrong hands he can
become a punching bag. This faq is dedicated to providing you with the
information necessary to assure you aren't one of the punching bags.


|Strengths and Weaknesses|

You got a quick overview of Jin's overall power but I'll go into a bit more
detail on those strengths and then cover his weaknesses so you can beware.

On the strength side I've already mentioned his speed and power. He is
probably the fastest male character in the game though still a bit slower
that the females. He does however have a lot of quick recovery attacks which
allow him to be more offensive with less worry of being punished. Some of
his moves are very powerful and do large amounts of damage while also
setting you up for a juggle combo. He probably has one of if not the best
sidestepping attack in the game, the Tooth Fairy(SS+2). It's very quick and
is an immediate juggle starter which should allow you to take half of your
opponents life in one instance. It's a risky move as it is one of his slower
recovering attacks, however if used correctly the strengths far outweigh the
weaknesses.

Another one of Jin's strengths is his ability to crouch dash and initiate
quite a few different moves from it. This keeps the opponent guessing as to
what move you will perform thus giving you a greater chance of getting
through their guard. Some of his moves also use the f,f motion which allows
him to use the dash buffer technique, which is explained later in this guide,
giving those moves greater range.

And last but not least Jin has a semi unique ability to add delay to a few
of his moves. Other characters have this ability too, but Jin's delayed
moves are some of his most powerful ones making it a dangerous combination.
His stun punch string(b,f+2,1,[2_d+2]) is quite arguably his best attack due
to it's high damage, ability to juggle, it double over stuns on a major
counter and to top it off it's delay-able. This is the heart of Jin's attack
style and everything should revolve around it. Not to say it should be
abused as it could obviously get you in trouble, however its strengths far
outweigh its weaknesses and besides there is a way around those that I will
explain later on.

Now on to the weaknesses. Jin has a few flaws, usually in the form of an
absence of a certain attack or special move. The number 1 thing on that list
is the fact that he doesn't have a low parry. For those who don't
rely on them with your other characters you may not understand what you are
missing without it. A low parry gives your character the ability to
cancel any low attack immediately thus stopping it or the string in which
the move was in. This means Jin has to block all low attacks unless he can
interrupt them before hand which is risky indeed. For instance if another
Jin does the hopping kicks(u/f+4,4,4,4) and you are Jin you basically have
to block the 2 sweeps as their isn't nearly enough time to interrupt them
once they are started. However characters with low parries can stop the
string on the 2nd or 3rd hit and a few can even unleash nasty combos.
That is just a small example but the low parry is a definite ace in the whole
type move and Jin is unfortunately without it.

His other main weakness is the lack of a quick juggle starter. While he has
some of the best uppercuts around, they all take time to initiate so they
aren't good for punishing after a blocked attack. He does have the can-can
kicks(d+3+4) which are fairly quick to initiate, but their lack of any range
whatsoever takes away from the speed of execution factor. He just doesn't
have any moves to juggle in an instant like a d/f+2, u/f+4, etc...

Other than those he really doesn't have many weaknesses. I think his main
weakness is the fact that he takes a bit longer to learn than the average
character. He seems a very straight forward character, but to play him to
his fullest degree takes a lot of time and practice, whereas characters like
Law and Paul can be learned rather quickly and don't require as much skill
to play. Don't get me wrong, you CAN play those characters with high levels
of strategy, my only point is that you can reach that level much faster with
them than you can with Jin. Let's face it, you put a mediocre Paul against a
mediocre Jin and 9 times out of 10 the Paul will win because of his ease of
use. I'll probably take flak from Paul players for this, but regardless what
anyone says he is a very easy character to play due to his simple joystick
commands, low risk attacks and high damage.


|Basic Play Style|

Now that we know a bit about Jin's strengths and weaknesses we can discuss a
bit about his basic play style. Obviously as with any character you are the
one who decides how to play them. I don't think there is a right or wrong
answer, however I do believe that characters have attributes which make them
better at certain play styles. Jin happens to be excellent at keeping the
character on the defensive by a steady flurry of offensive attacks. He can
also be played defensively as well but my theory is that the offensive
character has the advantage in Tekken 3 due to the chickens and low
recovery time after certain moves. In Tekken 2 the defensive character was
stronger because reversals and special throws were final so you could
constantly key upon mistakes made by the offensive player. It just doesn't
work that way in Tekken 3 anymore because Namco wanted to keep players from
sitting back and turtling which was so popular in Tekken 2. This is evident
in the fact that back dashing has a no guard recovery time. Meaning
characters who always try to tap back to stay away from the attacker are at
a high risk of attack after dashing. Many people complained though I think
it's great because it makes people fight up close face to face where the
true skilled player will win. Not the one who back dashes out of danger the
most.

To be an excellent Jin player you need to be able to adjust and play both
ways. If you take control of the match early on you should stay offensive.
Never let up when you are ahead or you risk losing that momentum. However if
you are low on energy and or behind you should definitely understand how to
play defensively. When you are offensive you are obviously going to take
some damage from the opponent so if you are low on energy you are taking a
risk. Playing defensively could theoretically keep you out of harms way if
you do it right, but again defense has weaknesses in Tekken 3 so the player
can capitalize on them.


************
*Jin Basics*
************

|Jin is not Kazuya|

If you are a returning Tekken 2 player their is one thing you should realize
before playing Jin. He is not Kazuya so don't try to play him that way.
There are many differences, most which I won't discuss as it's not the focus
of this guide. The main thing you need to know is that you cannot rely on
the Wind God Fist(f,N,d,d/f+2) like you could with Kazuya. That was arguably
the best move in Tekken 2 because of its  awesome recovery time which made
it low risk, and the fact that it hit mid level meaning you couldn't duck it
and could only block, interrupt or reverse it somehow. Kazuya players could
abuse that move without worry and the payoffs were high when it hit.
Unfortunately Jin doesn't share this advantage with his father and instead
his Wind God Fist hits high. This fact alone greatly diminishes its
usefulness in battle. Not only can you duck it but if it happens to hit as a
major counter it knocks the opponent away taking the ability to juggle
afterwards with it. Not to say that it is completely worthless now, only you
can't rely on it like Kazuya could so you must drastically change your play
style. You probably won't even need me to tell you that as anyone attempting
to play Jin like Kazuya will learn the hard way rather quickly.

Jin still has a lot of Kazuya's strengths and also some obvious new ones
Kazuya never had. The moves he gained from his mother come in quite handy as
do the ones unique to him. All in all the main things he is missing from
Kazuya is a proper Wind Godfist, the rising stun punch, the twin pistons and
the ability to buffer the crouch dash from a sidestep. This may not seem
like much but to any Kazuya die hards will know that those attacks were the
heart of Kazuya's effectiveness. When playing Jin for the first time just
remember to keep an open mind. He has his own play style and it just has to
be learned with time.


|The art of the crouch dash|

Before we can really get down to gameplay tactics you must learn how to
effectively crouch dash. For those not familiar with that term, it's
basically a move in itself performed by the (f,N,d,d/f) motion. When done
with no button inputs Jin will quickly crouch and rush forward a bit. From
this motion you can perform 3 of his major attacks. The Wind God Fist, the
Hell Sweep and the Thunder God Fist. The beauty of this move which some
people don't realize is that you can initiate any of these moves at any time
during the crouch dash animation. That means you can perform any of those
moves at the beginning of the animation so he won't dash at all , or you can
wait till the end of the animation where he can gain distance and duck
underneath an opponents high attack. You can also choose to perform the move
anywhere between the beginning and end or choose to not attack at all.
Needless to say the crouch dash is a very important part of Jin's arsenal
and must be learned immediately. The only problem is that it's one of the
most difficult motion to master in Tekken 3, only second to Law's Dragon
Slide or Kuma's roll. The difference however is that you use Jin's all the
time so it must be perfected. The motion itself is basically a dragon punch
from Street Fighter, but it is requires more direct and precise joystick
movements. You can basically rub out a dragon punch in Street Fighter fairly
easy but in Tekken its quite different and takes some practice. And since
the crouch dash is a dash type move you must learn how to stay in it longer
instead of the immediacy of a dragon punch. With time it can become as
natural as a fireball motion but it takes a bit of practice and until you
get it down your Jin will suffer.

Not to jump too far ahead, but there are quite a few tricks that can be done
with the crouch dash that will be explained later on. These will strengthen
your Jin greatly so again learning this motion is an absolute must.


|The art of the dash buffer|

The dash buffer is a trick, not necessarily exclusive to Jin, that you must
learn and incorporate into your arsenal. It's basically the act of tacking
on a special move to the end of a dash whether it be backwards or forwards.
For the most part you will be doing forwards buffers but there are a few
backwards ones you will learn. The dash buffer is quite easy to do, it only
requires a move that uses a f,f or b,b motion, or in some cases only b or f.
For the sake of Jin you will learn it with moves that begin with f,f or b.
Jin has 3 moves that require the f,f motion. The stomach rush(f,f+2), the
left ax kick(f,f+3) and the Stonehead throw(f,f+1+2). Each of these can be
performed immediately without moving forward by quickly tapping f,f then the
buttons however you can delay the button tap after the f,f motion for a few
frames which will gain you some distance. Some of you may by doing this now
without realizing its anything special though it is. There are uses for both
ways of performing those moves. Without the dash buffer technique you can
perform the moves instantly, while using the buffer will gain you distance
and a delay time if you want. For instance if a character misses an attack
you can quickly tap f,f+2 to nail them with an immediate Stomach Rush. On
the other hand if you were to block a slow recovery type move like a death
fist or something similar a simple f,f+2 wouldn't have enough range to hit
the attacker. Using the dash buffer technique would allow you to dash
forward a bit and then release the Stomach Rush. The time to perform it will
lag a bit but it will at least let you answer your opponents long distance
attack, and it might even hit if they don't expect it.

The back dash buffer is not quite as useful, for Jin at least, but it's good
to know it's there. This will work with b,b style moves, in which Jin
doesn't have any, or b moves in which Jin has a few. Most noticeably the
Stun Punch combo(b,f+2...), his unblockables(b_B+1+4), his
reversal(b+[1+3_2+4]) and his electric guard(b+1+2). You use it the same way
as the forward dash buffer and you can do things like back dash into an
immediate Stun Punch rush which can and does come in handy from time to
time. The motion for this would be (b,b(hold back),f+2,1... You are
basically using the second tap of the b,b motion as the first tap for you
b,f+2 motion which in a sense is like killing 2 birds with one stone and
that is what buffering attacks is all about.

Bitch Kicks                     1+3             1               ***

These is the old Kazuya favorite all the way back from Tekken 1. It is only
a standard throw so it can be broken easily. However since it is simple to
perform requiring no joystick movements it is quick to initiate and can
throw your opponent off guard. You are also guaranteed a d/f+4 after this
throw(detailed instructions in the tricks section) which makes it another
plus.

Over the shoulder toss          2+4             2               **

Jin's other standard throw. Not quite as entertaining as the Bitch Kicks,
and it also doesn't have a guaranteed ground hit afterwards so overall
damage is less.

Stonehead                       f,f+1+2         1+2             *****


This is without argue Jin's most useful throw. For one thing it can be dash
buffered making it a long distance throw. Second of all it's the most
difficult to escape because it requires the person to use 2 buttons instead
of just 1. To top it off it also allows you to get a free d/f+4 kick in
afterwards just like the Bitch Kicks, and it's much easier to time as well.
The only negative thing about this throw is that it requires a joystick
motion so it takes a little bit longer to initiate.

Striking Shiho Rage             d/f+2+3         2               ***


Jin learned this throw from his mother and is arguably his best looking one.
Even though it is a special throw it only requires one button to escape so
it's hard to give it a high usefulness rank. The d/f+2+3 command itself can
be initiated almost as fast as a regular throw but when you are a ways from
your opponent it is not a good choice. You can theoretically dash forward
and initiate it, but the f,f,d/f+2+3 motion is quite a bit more difficult
and you gain nothing in return. Since the escape is the same, anytime you
require a dash to close the distance you should use the Stonehead. This
throw also doesn't have any guaranteed extra hits afterwards.

One bonus is that you can get a guaranteed Hell Sweep in after this throw
which makes its overall damage the highest of all the throws. Keep this in
mind when you are going for the kill.

Twisting Wrist Toss             QCB+1+3         2               ***


This move gets the same basic rating as the previous one. It is escaped in
the same manner and is performed at around the same difficulty level. The
only reason to mix up these throws is for variety or in personal preference
to one of the commands.

1-2 Jabs                        1,2             ****

The 1-2 jabs are really just a part of other strings however I am
considering them their own move because they are very useful by themselves.
These are great for setting up special moves in juggles. For instance if you
knock someone in the air with a SS+2, most special moves aren't quick enough
to hit the opponent before they land. However the jabs are very quick and
will keep your opponent in the air long enough to connect with a special
move.

1-2 Jabs, Knee                  1,2,4           ***

This is just another extension of the 1-2 jabs that ends with a quick knee.
This can be used in the same manner of the 1-2 jabs, only it requires a
little better timing. It is also useful on the ground because these 3 hits
come out in rapid succession. It is good for pummeling your opponent back
and keeping them away because the knee knocks them back.

Devil Fists                     1,2,2           ***               D

Another classic Mishima combo. Very quick and powerful, however since the
combo doesn't knock you down it's a bit risky. It also isn't guaranteed to
hit even if the first 2 jabs hit so finishing it is also very risky. The
recovery time is slow so and the whole combo can be ducked so missing either
way will get you into serious trouble. Still good for using at the end of
juggle combos though.

Shining Fists                   1,1,2           *****             D

This is without a doubt Jin's most useful combo. It is extremely fast and if
the first jab connects then the rest is guaranteed. The last punch also hits
mid level so you can't duck the whole thing. But most importantly this move
has a delay factor so you don't have to buffer all punches ahead of time
before knowing if it is going to hit or not. This delay will be explained
later on in the guide, but for now just realize that you are given time to
decide to finish the combo or not after you tap the first 2 buttons. This is
part of what makes this combo so powerful.

Twin Pistons                    WS+1,2          **                J

The Twin Pistons are another move borrowed from his father, however Jin's
version is much weaker. Number 1 you can only initiate them while standing
from a crouch so there aren't many time when you'll get a chance to use
them. Even when you do get a chance they won't do much good unless they
major counter the opponent. Unlike his father's version these aren't
guaranteed to both hit if the first punch does. They first punch can connect
and the opponent can still block the second. Since only the second one
juggles this usefulness of this move is not very good. It is best used to
throw in some variety but is not an integral part of his arsenal.

Uppercut                        WS+2            *****             J

Without a doubt Jin's most useful juggle move. Since it is initiated while
standing from a crouch it is great for punishing opponents after ducking a
high attack or attempted throw. It also hits mid level so if they try to
duck it, it will still hit. The move knocks them very high into the air,
even high on a major counter. It is the only juggle starter thus far that
allows you to connect with a Thunder God Fist before they land. It is such a
great juggle because you gain immediate control over Jin the instant the
animation is over. There is absolutely no lag time which is what allows Jin
to perform some very large combos. With this move it is easy to see why the
Twin Pistons should not be used when instead you could connect with this.

Twin Lancers                    d/f+1,2         *****

Another one of Jin's key moves. While the move itself has no special
properties like the ability to juggle or stun the opponent, it is
nonetheless very useful. You should think of it as a catalyst to his other
moves. The recovery time after this move is incredible. It also moves you
closer to your opponent so coupled with its recovery time it's quite
dangerous indeed. I've already mentioned Jin's ability to perform a heavy
barrage of attacks on the opponent and this is one of the moves involved in
that ability. It can be used to end juggles as well however it's best suited
for close combat.

Overhead Smash                  f+2             ***

This move is the same as the second hit of the previous combo. Used by
itself it's not quite as useful, though it still holds some value. It hits
mid level and comes down in an arch so its great for punishing ducking
opponents. It can also be used to end juggles that knock the opponent out of
reach.

Tooth Fairy                     SS+2            *****             J

Another one of Jin's key juggle starters. This one is special because it can
be initiated from a sidestep and it only requires 1 button to perform so you
should never miss the move because of a failed command. It's great for
sidestepping an opponents attack and then knocking them into the air for a
juggle combo. The recovery time for this move is a bit slow so you must be
careful not to miss your opponent or perform it when they can block. Used
correctly however this move can be your enemies worst nightmare.

Wind God Fist                   f,N,d,d/f+2     ***               J

One of his father's best moves, though Jin's watered down version doesn't
even compare. It has 2 major weaknesses that bring its usefulness down to
only 3 *'s. First of all it hits high now so it can be very easily ducked so
be prepared to be punished for even trying it. Second if it hits as a major
counter it will knock the opponent far away so you can't juggle them. This
means the only way to juggle is to NOT major counter with it. That is one of
the most unique special properties in the game. All is not lost however as
it is still very useful in certain situations(which will be explained
later), you just can't abuse this move or you'll find yourself on the ground
quite a bit.


Name                            Command         Usefulness        Properties
----                            -------         ----------        ----------
Electric Wind God Fist          f,N,d,d,D/F+2   *****             J

You're probably thinking "what in the hell is an Electric Wind God Fist?".
Well the term "Super Wind God Fist"  was actually used in Tekken 2 and I
believe Namco actually decided to make it a reality in Tekken 3 though it gaine
d
a new name. In Tekken 2 it was basically just a name for performing a Wind God
Fist so early in the crouch dash animation that it seemed as if he never
actually dashed. While it had no special properties it was very useful in
combos and for also surprising your opponent in close quarters. In Tekken 3
Namco decided to make this phenomenon actually perform a different variation
of the Wind God Fist, thus we have the Electric Wind God Fist.

This version is quite hard to perform consistently as it takes excellent
timing of the joystick and punch button. You must actually tap right punch the
instant the joystick arrives in the D/F position and continue to hold it
there. That isn't too hard but it also must be performed so quickly that you
can't see him dash. You'll know when you do it because lightning surrounds
Jin's arm even if it doesn't connect with the opponent.

So what are the advantages of this move? If it's blocked it will block stun
your opponent and send them back and they will have no chance for responding
to it. Unlike the normal Wind God Fist it's a guaranteed juggle regardless if
it counter hits or not as well as does more damage than a regular Wind God
Fist. And if that's not enough it also has better juggling capabilities as it
doesn't knock you quite as far away and it gives you a bit more hang time
which allows for a few more juggle options with the extra time. It goes
without saying that under most circumstances you should attempt this variety
of the move. Unless of course you are going for distance or delay, but in most
situations especially in juggles it is the clear winner.

[Hell Sweep _Side Kick]

Just as with the Wind God Fist, the Thunder God Fist now hits high as well
so even it can be ducked. The hit mechanics themselves though are still
quite strange because even though it hits high it can duck underneath a jab
if properly timed. The 2 kicks that are available afterwards help it out
some but they can be easily interrupted before they can be performed. The
best use for the Thunder God Fist is either used in juggles where it can't
be blocked or ducked, or also performed sparingly for sheer variety. The
damage is so great with this move that it's worth the risk once in awhile.

Stomach Rush                    f,f+2           *****             [R],DB

This is the ultimate long distance attack. It has the same properties as
Paul's Death Fist, but comes in a smaller package. Since it used the f,f
command it can be dash buffered for greater range. This should be one of the
most used moves in Jin's arsenal. There really is nothing bad about this
move at all. The only negative I can see is that it telegraphs itself a
little bit so people will have a better chance of reversing it. However if
you simply buffer a chicken with it every time you perform it(I'll
explain later) the risk is nil. Only Law, Ling and Lei have anything to stop
it that you can't do anything about and they'd be risking and Ling and Lei
would be risking a hell of a lot to even think of attempting it. Great for
punishing slow recovery attacks, whiffed attacks or just used at the end of
juggles, this is one move you will use a lot.

Stun Punch Combo                b,f+2,1,[2_d+2] *****             J,[S],D

If the Stomach Rush is one of the best punch attacks then this is the
ultimate. If your Jin style doesn't revolve around this combo in some way,
shape or form then you are severely limiting Jin's power. This is possibly
the best string attack in the game as it has awesome special properties. It
can end in 2 different ways, one of which juggles the opponent and the other
which sends them flying like the Stomach Rush. It can be initiated almost
instantaneously and if it counter hits it will double over stun the
opponent. Better yet, if you happen to stun the opponent you are set up for
an 80%+ combo that makes your opponents life bar extinct in short order. And
if all that wasn't enough the move is delay-able which makes it very hard to
reverse. If you mix up your timing then your opponent will have to guess as
to when to attempt a reversal. The problem for them is if they miss-time
their attempt it could mean severe punishment. Even if they do time the
reversal correctly you can buffer a chicken just like with the
Stomach Rush which makes your opponents life a living hell. There will be
much discussion on this move later on in the guide.

If the first hit of this string hits as a CH then the opponent will be stunned
with no chance for escape. If you do the fist to parts(b,f+2,1) and they CH
then the opponent will still be stunned but they can escape by simply tapping
the controller forward and they will safely be able to block any follow up
even if you fully completed the string. The only choice for a guaranteed combo
is to stop after the b,f+2 and then attempt to combo. However you have much
less time to juggle after b,f+2 than you do after b,f+2,1. That is the cost
of it being guaranteed.

It used to be thought that the only guaranteed follow up for a juggle after
b,f+2 on a stun was the can-can kicks(d+3+4). However it has been recently
found that you can also follow up with a WGF or EWGF if timed perfectly. This
will knock the opponent up in the air just like normal and allow you to do
the most powerful, and most difficult, Jin combos in the game.

Also be aware that the last punch of this combo, whichever one you choose to
end it with, can be sidestepped 100% of the time by your opponent. This means
you must be very careful on choosing when you want to end it. If you attempt
to finish the combo and they sidestep it you are wide open and in a bad
position. If you fight an opponent who seems to sidestep after the second hit
a lot then you can set him up. A throw works well for those sidestepping
freaks because a it will automatically orientate you in the direction of
your opponent. If you attempt to do a move while they are on the side of you
it will most likely be aimed forward which makes your position even worse.
The throw might get broken but at least you will be in a better position than
with your side to the opponent.

Spinning God Fist               b+1+4           **               UB

This is one of Jin's 2 unblockable attacks. It is basically a smaller
version of his Super Spinning God Fist that does half damage. Although most
unblockable attacks in Tekken 3 are quite slow, this one is fairly quick to
initiate. It also hits mid level and causes Jin to move forward so your
opponent will have no choice but to interrupt it or reverse it somehow.

This is Jin's most powerful single move however it is also the slowest to
initiate. Even though it hits mid level and carries him forward it is very
easy to see coming and makes it almost worthless. He spins in 2 complete
circles before unleashing it giving the opponent plenty of time to do
something. If they interrupt you with a ducking jab it will even pop you up
in the air allowing them to pull off a small juggle combo which is not a
good thing. I recommend sticking with the smaller version of this move if
you must use an unblockable.

This string is one of Jin's exclusive moves that wasn't borrowed form either
parent. It's a bit slow but has some good properties. First of all the third
move, which is the ax kick, will block stun the opponent which gives you the
initiative for another attack. The last kick can be mixed up between a right
ax kick and a rising mid kick. If you are at extremely close range the
rising mid kick can't be blocked after the ax kick stuns them. And to add
another twist, if the third hit connects you can actually start a juggle
from it. Keep in mind however that the time between the second jab and the
first kick is a bit slow so the opponent will have time to interrupt if they
so choose to do. It also opens up an opportunity for reversal, but again you
can be prepared by buffering a chicken. Last but not least you can
use this move for the end of a juggle combo, but with other powerful enders
like the Stun Punch Combo there is no need to.

White Heron Combo               1+4,2,[4_d+4]   ****             J,TR

One of his mother's old combos, the White Heron is a valuable addition to
his arsenal indeed. While using it on the ground is fairly useful, its real
strength is its use in juggle combos. Since the move starts out very low to
the ground it is great for starting juggles out of strange scenarios like
after a Left Ax Kick or Hell Sweep. It is also one of the few moves that
will juggle well after his can-can kicks. On the ground it can be quite
useful because the last kick can be ending either high or low. This makes
the opponent have to make a choice in order to block it correctly. If they
block high and you go low you will knock them off of their feet and are able
to perform a juggle combo immediately after. If they block low and you end
it high it will simply knock them down, though it does good damage. The only
negative about the move is that the second and third hits are both high so
an alert opponent can duck quickly and interrupt you before you get to the
final attack. On the other hand it can be used quite well in Okizeme
situations so there really isn't much bad to say about this combo.

To some this move seems completely worthless however in reality it is quite
useful. The knee itself has no special properties whatsoever and does
minimal damage. Even with that against it, it still holds some value so long
as you understand its purpose. The knee is one of the few mid attacks that
cannot be reversed so you can abuse it, but more importantly it knocks your
opponent back out of your face to give you breathing room. It is initiated
so quickly and has so much priority that anytime you feel too close for
comfort with your opponent you can simply bring out the knee and back them
away. Since I've already mentioned the dangers of back dashing a lot you can
see how this move would be of benefit. If you want to be away from your
opponent why not push them back instead of you.

Double Ax Kick                  d/f+4,4 or      *****
                                WS+4,4
        
While the Stun Punch Combo is the king of the punch attacks, the Double Ax
Kick reigns supreme over kick attacks. This simple move has so much going
for it that if you don't exploit its full possibilities in your arsenal then
you are limiting your Jin's potential. There are a lot of features to cover
but since I feel this move is so important I will try to cover them all.

First and foremost this move can be initiated 3 different ways. The easiest
is the d/f+4,4 methods because you can do it from a standing position. The
next method is simply WS+4,4 which is nice because you can duck  under
attacks and punish an opponent with it while you stand up. Finally, an
excellent method but somewhat unknown is to use it at the end of a crouch
dash. This is not shown in the move list because it's not an *official*
move. You are basically doing a crouch dash then performing the WS+4,4
method at the end. This however is one very smooth and fast motion that
looks as if it was meant to be used in this manner. The exact motion for
this method is f,N,d,d,f,N+4,4. It follows the same rules as any crouch dash
style attack therefore you can pull out the Double Ax Kick at any point
during the dash. This variety is great for ending large combos that knock
your opponent a good distance away. The WS+4,4 methods also take a small
amount more damage than the d/f+4,4 way so if you have a choice between the
2 opt for the more damaging version.

Since the Double Ax Kick hits twice, it's pretty obvious that you may only
choose to use one of those hits. To do this simply use d/f+4 or WS+4. This
has great advantages because the first hit of the ax kick has the unique
ability of pulling opponents off of the ground if they so much as to flinch.
It's considered a mid level hit but because it hits while his leg is on the
way up it tends to connect very low to the ground. His recovery after the
first kick by itself is very fast so you can use it in small custom strings
which I will explain a bit later.

The move is insanely fast, does good damage and has awesome range. Jin
actually slides forward on his left foot while the first leg is coming up so
doing it from a standstill will move you forward a bit. If the opponent
blocks both hits you will still slide toward them but it will knock them
away so there is a good chance even after they block it that they won't be
able to retaliate. The recovery isn't as fast as the single ax kick, however
it is still quite fast compared with other kick attacks. It has great
priority over other characters moves and since it covers most of Jin's
frontal area it can interrupt most attacks regardless of their height. It
eats low attacks for dinner along with mid and high ones. If you are looking
for the safest move to start the round off with then this might just be it.
It can obviously be reversed, but the speed of its execution is so great
that most people won't be able to grab it on reflex alone. They would almost
have to completely guess it was coming and take a chance on trying to
reverse it.

Quite simply put, this should be one of your most used moves next to the
Stun Punch Combo. It's high strengths and low weaknesses allow you to abuse
it without too much worrying of being punished. Specific uses will be
mentioned in the strategy section of this guide.

Left Ax Kick                    f,f+3           ***              DB,J,TR

Another move learned from his father the Left Ax Kick is quite a powerful
attack. If it connects at close range you can even start juggle combos from
it. Like other f,f style attacks it can be easily dash buffered to get more
range in which it needs. With all these pluses you'd think it would be quite
useful however it is actually slow to initiate so it basically telegraphs
itself giving the opponent time to interrupt, reverse or block. You can
easily deal with the reversals by buffering a chicken and it has good
recovery so even if they block you won't be in too much danger. The slow
wind up is the moves demise as it is very susceptible to interruption. Many
times I get it interrupted by complete accident which is annoying. I find
the best use for this move is to perform it with the dash buffer after an
opponent has whiffed a move or you blocked one of their slow recovering
attacks. Keep in mind however that there are other better moves more suited
to that situation so this would only be used for variety or to throw your
opponent off.

Hell Sweep, Roundhouse          f,N,d,D/F+4,4   *****            J,TR

Another one of the Mishima characters bread and butter attacks that you
simply cannot survive without. Jin's is a bit different from his fathers and
grandfathers though it seems to have the best of both worlds. It hits twice
and at different heights so it one ups his fathers version, and if both hits
are blocked it has great recovery time much like his grandfather. The Hell
Sweep however is best used as a single sweep instead of following it up with
the roundhouse. This is simply because you can initiate juggle combos if you
connect with the sweep only at close range. The opponent can't tech roll if
they are hit with the sweep therefore you have plenty of time to decide your
next move. A simple Hell Sweep connecting can end up doing 30% or more of
your opponents damage because of the combos possible afterwards.

Since this move can be initiated from the crouch dash it can be performed
with some distance or immediately close to you. It is very quick making it
hard to block, however if it is and you only do the one sweep you are left
open for attack. That is why using only the sweep part is riskier that
following up with the roundhouse, however the benefits far outweigh the
risks. Even if it is blocked there is a good chance that you will come out
of it unharmed. You regain control to block in time, only your opponent will
have the initiative so you have to guess what level of height to block at.

This is probably the most difficult crouch dash attack to perform simply
because you have to hold D/F when you are in the dash. It takes some
practice to get a high consistency with it but its imperative that you do. A
Jin not utilizing this move is severely limited.

Hopping Kicks                   u/f+4,4,4,4     ***             J

It's ironic that I considered this one of Kazuya's weakest moves yet it is
actually quite useful for Jin. Part of the reason is simply because it has a
tracking ability so it will follow the opponent around. Sometimes even in a
complete 180! Not only that but if the first hit connects then the third and
fourth are usually guaranteed to follow. Another reason it is more useful is
because you can easily buffer a chicken for the last roundhouse and
be safe, except when fighting against King that is as you can't break his
reversals as of yet. You'll notice this move has the ability to juggle
though the opportunity is fairly rare. To juggle from it the opponent has to
block the first hit and connect with the second. Or block the first and
second and connect with the third. If you do hit with one of the those you
can follow it up with any Hell Sweep style juggles as the second and third
hits are basically Hell Sweeps to begin with. The difficult part is that you
have to hit the u/f+4,4,4,4 buttons very quickly so you have to decide
whether or not you are going to finish the combo right away. You
unfortunately can't wait to see if  the sweeps are going to hit before you
decide to finish with the rest of the combo.

All in all this is a fairly useful move that does very good damage so if you
see an opening its a good idea to use it. It works very well against those
pesky Eddy players who are all over the place so keep that in mind.

Arching Roundhouse              [4_B+3]         ***

These powerful roundhouses were learned form his mother. While they don't
have any special attributes they are quite powerful and will knock your
opponent down on contact. When Jin performs one of these kicks he slightly
steps to the side making it an evasive style attack. He performs the exact
same kick with both legs so the way he side steps is dependent on the leg
you perform it with. These moves can also be initiated immediately from an
actual sidestep making them even more evasive. Since they are very quickly
performed they work well as a guaranteed hit after blocking a slow attack. I
generally prefer using a quick punch combo after blocking a slow recovering
attack, however at longer range the punches wouldn't connect so these kicks
are a great alternative.

Can-Can Kicks                   d+3+4           *               J

You should notice immediately that these kicks have the lowest usefulness
ranking of any move. They were borrowed from his mother however his version
is extremely watered down. This is the only move that I am aware of that you
can block both by crouching or standing. Which means that unless you
actually connect with them while your opponent isn't blocking they have no
chance to hit. They also have a nasty recovery time so if they get blocked
you are basically shit out of luck. They also have absolutely no range
whatsoever so unless you are extremely close to the opponent they would have
to walk into the kicks to be hit. The fact that no matter where your
opponent blocks these kicks won't connect coupled with the slow recovery
time makes these kicks a major danger to Jin. They do juggle if they happen
to connect, but they don't knock you very high and the only real juggles you
can perform afterwards involve the White Heron combo. You don't even have
enough time to get a jab in most of the time so it's one of the few normal
juggle starters that won't allow you to use the Stun Punch Combo in the
combo.

Still there is at least one decent use for it. If you block an extremely
close range and very slow recovering attack they offer an immediate chance
to juggle your opponent. Still though since they are slow to intiate you
risk the opponent recovering in time to block putting you in a world of
hurt.

You're probably wondering what in the hell move this is. Well it's not on
his official move list however it's a very useful kick that you should know.
Some of you have never seen it while other may have and not even had a
second thought about it. The animation similar to that of the u/f+4 hop
kicks that some characters have(King, Law, Kuma, etc...). Jin however can
only jump back or do a delayed version while jumping forward. The jumping
forward delayed version is not very useful as it's slow and has little
priority. The quick jumping back version however has some good points. It
initiates immediately and has awesome priority so if you are in danger at
close range you can whip this move out to safety. It also works if you think
your opponent is about to attack because it stops them dead in their tracks.
This is not something that plays a huge roll in Jin's overall strategy, but
it's something you should be aware of so that you can use it in the right
situations. I find myself using quite often.

While this move may seem a bit strange it is actually quite usefull in juggles
but not much outside of that. Since the first few hits of a juggle do the most
damage and then the damage deteriorates thereafter, our first move after a
juggle starter is important. The sheer amount of damage that this move does
makes it perfect for following up a WS+2 or even a WGF.This move does much
more damage than a simple jab(32 points to be exact) and it can be followed up
with other moves so it works quite well. It at least gives you the option of
mixing up your juggles a bit more.

This is a universal kick that a good deal of characters have though its not
really very useful in higher levels of play. It does have the nice ability to
stun your opponent even without a CH so it is fairly unique in that respect.
It can be followed up for pretty hefty damage so that alone makes it useful,
but it is a bit slow and you probably won't hit it too often against better
opponents.

Crushing Kick                   4~3             ****            P

Extremely powerful and useful move for hitting grounded opponents. With the
advent of the tech roll in Tekken 3 ground attacks have been severely
limited. This attack however has long range, quickness and power on its
side. It can't be used as a guaranteed last hit for juggle combos like so
popular in Tekken 2, but here are some situations where it is almost
guaranteed. It works great on characters like Lei and Eddy who tend to be
all over the place and on the ground. Since characters can't block when on
the ground this move is will hit so long as you aim it right. It's a bit
risky to just use out of nowhere, but you recover in enough time to get a
shin kick off before most characters can attack.

It's also good for the art of Okizeme in which you are trying to attack a
fallen opponent. We know it's no longer guaranteed for ending combos, but it
can still be used against grounded opponents. If the opponent always quick
rises you can usually keep punishing them with White Heron's or Double Ax
Kicks as they try to rise. It generally becomes a guessing game as you try
to out think each other. If you expect a tech roll and decide to attack but
they don't tech roll they can attack you before you recover from your
attack animation. It also works the other way around but you can see where
you'd have a chance of hitting it. If you try attacking right away all the
time the opponent may get a bit tech roll shy and let you miss your
attempted  attack. If you suspect that they won't tech roll you can
immediately do the Crushing Kick and they won't have much of a chance to
react. Keep in mind this is a game of anticipation and outthinking your
opponent so nothing is guaranteed. However with a keen eye and overall good
feel for your opponents actions you can come out ahead most of the time on
these exchanges.

Ultimate Tackle                 [d_d/b+1+2]     **

The Ultimate Tackle is another move passed down from Kazuya though it
doesn't seem to be quite as useful in Tekken 3 due to the ease of escaping
tackles. It is also possible for everyone to escape the mounted punches so
that makes it even more useless. However there are a few tricks that will be
explained later that give this move a better chance of successfully
connecting. And if the opponent fails to escape it you can do upwards of 45
points of damage utilizing the mounted punches and the arm bar.

Corpse Splitter                 [u_u/f+2+4]     *               P

Another one of Jin's seemingly worthless moves and for the most part it is
except for a few situations. The main one that comes to mind is an escape
route from a running opponent. If your opponent is running at you full speed
sometimes even a sidestep won't save you. Next time try performing this move
as they come at you and they will run right underneath you while you fly
through the air. Obviously it's a bit risky but it might get you out of
trouble once or twice.

Electric Guard                  B+1+2           **

This move is often labeled as completely worthless but there are a few
situations that it works quite well. It is mostly a defensive maneuver so it
should be used accordingly. It will repel any special move including
Yoshimitsu's Bad Breath and only a throw can actually penetrate it. One of
the best uses for it is when an opponent is running at you from across the
screen. If you time it correctly no matter what the opponent does, whether
it be slide, shoulder bash, side kick, etc..., it will knock them back to
the ground instantly. This move is a bit delayed so you must initiate it a
bit earlier than you might think.

It is also possible to combo from this move if you catch an opponent in the
air at the right time. Again this is very difficult but possible and it does
come in handly under certain situations like Yoshimitsu's QCF+1, Ling's
f,f+3+4, King's f+1+4, etc.. Various combos are listed in the combo section.

Reversal                        b+1+3 or b+2+4  *****

This move's usefulness is quite obvious. A reversal is a cherished thing as
you can catch an opponent unawares and reverse their attack. It got the
highest usefulness rating however remember that in Tekken 3 you can now
break reversals. This means that you must be very selective on the times you
attempt reversals because doing them at obvious times will get them broken.
Jin's reversal is one of the better ones because it is one of the few that
catches Yoshimitsu's sword, something that Paul still hasn't learned in all
of these years. Catching the swords is quite dangerous but satisfying when
accomplished.


|Strings|

Since Jin has many variations of his string attacks I'll focus on the 3
different varieties and their various change-ups. Personally I don't use ten
strings that often and don't recommend them in most cases. However you still
need to know what Jin is capable of and be aware of all his different string
variations. You might even have to block another Jin's strings once in
awhile so be prepared.

b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,1,3
b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,1,4
b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,3+4
b+2,4,2,1,2

This is perhaps Jin's most useful set of strings. Once started they are some
of the most difficult to interrupt. They aren't hard to block but you might
force the opponent to simply block the whole thing and make them guess which
variety of enders you will decide to use. They aren't infallible though
because the first 3 hits are the weak points. The first 2 hits are high so
they can be blocked and interrupted by an alert opponent. Once he starts
hopping they are difficult to interrupt but there are still chances for
reversals or low parries. The most popular reversal point is the 3rd kick so
be aware and ready to break the reversal.


3,2,4,3,1+4,2,2,1,2
3,2,4,3,1+4,2,1,3
3,2,4,3,1+4,2,1,4

While I consider these to be the coolest looking Jin strings they are
unfortunately worthless for the most part. The 4th hit is the killer as it
hits high and gives the opponent plenty of time to interrupt. Anytime a Jin
player tries this on me I calmly duck the 4th hit and counter with a WS+2
and juggle them to infinity. No matter if the first hit of the string is a
major counter or not you always have the ability to duck the 4th hit. With
that said I can't give these strings much recommendation except that they do
more damage and they can add occasional variety to your game.


f,f,N+2,1,2,2,3,4,3,2,1
f,f,N+2,1,2,2,3,4,1,2,1
f,f,N+2,1,4,4,2,4,3,2,1

Jin borrowed these strings from his father in Tekken 2 and they are exactly
the same. Like the first set of strings these are difficult to interrupt
once they get going but the fact that 2 of them start out with 4 high hits
they are easy to duck and counter. The last string is the most useful of
this series and is the one I recommend most of the time. Only the first 2
hits are high and then he goes into an Ax Kick which they can't duck out of.


***************
*Juggle Combos*
***************

Much like his father before him, Jin is quite the juggler. He actually has
more options to juggle than his Kazuya only his seem to do less damage. And
the unfortunate taming of his normal Wind God Fist means you will have fewer
chances to juggle on a whole. However Jin has other ways to start juggles
that Kazuya didn't have like his Tooth Fairy and Can Can Kicks. Needless to
say juggles are an important part of Jin's strategy so learning them is a
must.

For those that aren't fully comfortable with the Tekken 3 combo system I
recommend reading the Juggle section of my advanced strategy guide located
on Tekken Web Project before proceeding. For those of you who 'think' you
know everything about juggles I still recommend giving that article a
browse. It might explain something you weren't aware of and either way it
makes for good reading.


|Jin Juggling Basics|

Assuming you have a good grasp of the concepts of juggling we can examine
the specialties Jin has in this area. Jin has about 10 different moves that
he can juggle from in some way shape or form which should clue you in on his
natural ability to juggle. They are:

d/f+2 on CH
WS+2
WS+1,2
SS+2
f,N,d,[d/f_D/F]+2
b,f+2,1,d+2
d+3+4
f,f+3 on CH
f,N,d,D/F+4
1+4,2,d+4
B+1+2

Each of these moves have some sort of juggling characteristic that can be
utilized in some way. For now we'll stick to the standard juggles which
means the punch variety.

Not all juggle starters are created equal and some are far better than
others. Meaning you can't do the same juggles from every juggle starter.
Some can only be followed up in one way while others give you the freedom to
follow up with just about anything you can think of. For instance after his
Can Can Kicks(d+3+4) just about the only possible follow up is the White
Heron combo(1+4,2...) while after a WS+2 you can do something as slow as a
Thunder God Fist or even his Hopping Spin Kicks. Knowing what is possible
after each of his juggle starters is extremely important. You may only get
one chance to juggle your opponent during a match and if you botch it up
because you weren't prepared you might end up losing.

Jin's WS+2 is without a doubt his best juggle starter. It knocks the
opponent extremely high into the air and more importantly you recover the
from the animation immediately giving you endless options. In fact it is
possible to time your attacks too early after this move so be careful. It was
once thought that this was the only move that would allow Jin to follow up
with a Thunder God Fist but this is not the case. Regardless, this is the best
juggle starter than Jin possesses and any time you have a chance to unleash it
you should take full advantage.

Jin's absolute worst juggle starter is his Can Can Kicks. It is damn near
impossible to perform anything other that the White Heron combo after this
move. Even a jab is extremely hard to connect and isn't worth the effort.
However this a still a useful juggle starter because of it's quick execution.
Jin doesn't have a juggling hop kick and his standard d/f+2 uppercut only
juggles on a CH so you're options are limited if you need a quick juggle
starter. For instance if you block Paul's Falling Leaf Combo(d+4,2) about
the only guaranteed juggle starter you can use is his Can Can Kicks and
perhaps his Super Wind God Fist. Since the Can Can Kicks are much more
reliable they will probably be your move of choice. Other than situations
like this the Can Can Kicks aren't much useful for anything else. The only
other situation is after a b,f+2 stun punch which we'll discuss later on.

So you now understand the importance of knowing what is possible after each
juggle starter we can take a look at the chart below for an idea of what the
best moves are. Keep in mind that juggle possibilities are endless so I
can't cover every possible option but I can give you a good start. The
charts below will let you know what is possible from each starter.

A follow up is simply any move that you use directly after a starter which
allows at least one more hit to connect afterwards. I consider a juggle to
have to be 3 or more hits.

                        b,f+2,1,[2_d+2]
                        1,2,...
                        [everything below]

                        1+4,2...
                        d+1

Juggle starter(s)       Possible follow-ups
-----------------       -------------------
B+1+2                   [special case combo discussed in combo section]



From here we can see how most of our juggles will be performed. From the
WS+2 we can try many different options but the Thunder God Fist is the
ultimate finisher. Our most common combos will fall into the second bracket
because those juggle starter will be more common under most match
situations. Therefore we can see the most common follow-up moves will be
some sort of jab combo or the Stun Punch Rush. I put a Wind God Fist as a
possible follow up simply because it works, however most of you won't be
using it as it does less damage than the much simpler Stomach Rush.

If you've read the juggle section of the advanced strategy guide like I
suggested then you will understand the importance of your choice of a juggle
follow up. Since successive hits start taking a damage penalty you have to
construct your combos carefully. It is not uncommon for a well designed
combo with fewer hits to do more damage than a poorly constructed combo that
requires more hits. With that in mind you should strive to perform the most
damaging follow up possible while still allowing yourself the ability for
extended juggles. It's a sort of balancing act where you try to weigh
damaging follow-ups with less damaging ones that allow more successive hits.

The Stun Punch Rush(b,f+2,1,d+2) is probably the best candidate for this
task as it is fairly damaging while allowing you to get a few successive
hits in. To follow up this move you have to finish with the d+2 punch
instead of the regular 2. The d+2 does less damage but knocks the opponent
high enough to allow for another hit or 2. The regular Stomach Rush ender
does more damage but it won't allow you to follow up with anything else so
the decision is up to you. It takes more skill to finish with the d+2 and
execute more follow-ups so you might want to stick with the regular ender
until you are up to the task.


|Unconventional Juggles|

I mentioned earlier that you could start juggles from strange moves like the
Hell Sweep and Ax Kick. I like to call these unconventional simply because
they aren't your average run of the mill juggle starters. While they usually
aren't as long or damaging as a normal juggle they are in a sense more
important because you likely to do them more often than regular juggles. For
instance you are more likely to connect with a Hell Sweep than you are a
Wind God Fist so being able to squeeze as much damage out of the situation
is a must.

The reason these moves work as juggle starters is because they knock the
opponent off their feet close to you without allowing them to do a quick
rise. That means you have until they lay on the ground to do some sort of
attack. While you could do something as easy as sweeping them before they
get up, it is much better to perform a full fledge combo. To do this you
have to catch them while they are actually in the falling animation which
will pop them back into the air providing you use the correct follow-up. The
most common follow-up is the first 3 hits of the White Heron combo because
they are simple to initiate and it's a guaranteed 3 hits. I mentioned d/f+4
and d+1 simply because they will work though you don't have as many options
from them.

The Left Ax Kick(f,f+3) is also a good unconventional juggle starter that
might present itself on occasion. It won't happen often but being able to
take advantage of it is important, and it might turn a few heads in your
local arcade as well. The reason this kick works is because on an CH the
opponent is knocked off their feet and actually bounced in closer to you.
They are completely at your mercy when this happens so a quick White Heron
is an easy way to follow-up.

The last type of unconventional starter I mentioned is the last low hit of
the White Heron Combo. This move reacts just like the Hell Sweep so it
should be treated in the same manner and followed up with another White
Heron.


|Stun Combos|

The most damaging of Jin's juggles will always start out with a stun. As you
can guess this means being able to combo after successfully performing a
double over stun to your opponent. In Jin's case it means after a b,f+2 or
b,f+2,1 on an CH and also with the universal Hopping Stun Kick(U/F,3). Both of
the stuns starting from the Stun Punch Rush combo will allow you to perform
juggle starters before they have a chance to fall while the Hopping Stun Kick
recovers too slowly and only allows you to attack them while they are in the
falling animation. The 2 punch stun variations are a bit different however
because the b,f+2 stun makes your opponent fall forward while the b,f+2,1 stun
makes them fall back. The trick is to hit the opponent as early in the stun
animation as possible so it will count as a standard ground hit. If you
connect too late in the animation it will actually pop your opponent in the
air and away from you which ruins the whole juggle potential. Also be aware
that even though you can juggle from both of these stuns, only the b,f+2
starter is unescapable. Your opponent can escape from the b,f+2,1 stun by a
simple tap forward on the controller. No matter how fast your attack comes
after they are stunned, they will be able to escape so b,f+2 is a better
choice. The downside to this is the fact that it is much more difficult to
juggle the opponent with the b,f+2 than it is from the b,f+2,1. The U/F+3 stun
is also unescapable but much less useful overall.

It was once thought that the only ground to air juggle starter that was
possible after the b,f+2 stun was the Can-Can kicks, however it was recently
found that a perfectly time Electric Wind God Fist will work as well and allow
humongous amounts of damage to be done. It is also 100 times more difficult to
time than the Can-Can kicks so you probably won't be successfull with it very
often. Using the b,f+2 stun setup into an EWGF is the start of Jin's most
damaging combo in the game which is listed in his combo list below. This combo
is argueably the toughest known combo in Tekken 3 so if you manage to perform
it you should feel damn proud. Most of you won't ever be able to achieve that
feat.

The b,f+2,1 stun is much easier to juggle from, especially when using the WGF
though since it's escapable it becomes far less useful in higher levels of
play. The U/F,3 juggle starter on the other hand is unescapable but its
recovery time is extremely slow and you won't have enough time to be able to
connect a ground to air juggle starter. You can still however dish out some
damage by connecting with a few powerful moves that they will have no chance
to guard against.

You can see the importance of knowing how to juggle out of stuns as they are
the single most damaging situation that Jin can encounter. With experienced
opponents you will find that you won't stun them as often, but when you do it
is good to know how to take full advantage of the situation.


|Flipover Juggles|

Another type of juggle that has been found since the original release of this
guide is the flipover. The flipover simply means that you flip your opponent
over in mid-air causing them to face the ground instead of up. The advantage
of this phenomenon is that when an opponent is face down when they hit the
ground they can't tech roll and it gives you extra time to connect with a
ground attack. This is one of the few instances in Tekken 3 where you can
still get a guaranteed ground attack in. Flipovers are generally rare because
they can only be accomplished in one way. You have to hit your opponent in
the air sideways instead of their head or feet. When you juggle normally you
always are hitting their feet, or head if they are facing backwards, but if
you can manage to hit them sideways which would effectively be their waist
you can cause them to flip over and get a possible free groud hit in.

Different characters have certain ways to initiate these types of juggles
but Jin is very limited. The only known ways that can be repeated consistently
are from a sidestep into Tooth Fairy(SS+2), connecting with his f+3 in mid-air
and hitting your opponent sideways while they are falling from a double over
stun animation. For the most part the last 2 won't be used too often. If you
stun your opponent you most likely won't want to waste the opportunity just to
be able to perform a flipover juggle since the damage won't be as good. And
hitting the f+3 in a juggle is also a waste because it has terrible recovery
time and you barely have enough time to get a ground attack in before they can
get up.

Most likely you will see flipovers when you sidestep an opponents attack and
then perform his Tooth Fairy. The move will juggle them straight up as normal
but when you perform the first air attack you will notice them flipover. This
type of juggle is unpredictable as the character will sometimes flip back over
to their original face up falling position and ruin you chances for ground
hits. Once you grasp the basic idea of it however you can tell when they will
stay flipped over and then you can take advantage of it. You will notice that
when the opponents face is down that they have different juggle
characteristics. They do not bounce upwards at all, in fact each successive
hit knocks them downwards a tiny bit. However they don't get knocked as far
away from you as a normal juggle so you if you perform a long, quick hitting
string attack it will generally keep them close and all hits will connect.

The combo section below will list a few of the possible flipover combos but
remember they aren't quite as useful for Jin as they are other characters.
It doesn't hurt to know them though as they can be fun to attempt on lesser
oppoenents and if you ever get one on accident you will be aware that it can
gain you an extra ground hit if you time it right.


|Electric Guard Juggles|

Another type of juggle that is somewhat unknown is the Electric Guard Juggle.
People listed this move in juggle before, but generally they use it as a
follow-up, not a starter.  Well I'll teach you how to use it as a starter and
wow some of you competition who might not have seen it before. It is
definately not easy to do, it takes much skill and timing, and it can only be
used in certain situations so you must be ready for them when they present
themselves.

The way it works is when an opponent does some sort of aerial based attack on
you, you can perform the Electric Guard which will cause them to bounce off of
you and allow you to get in a few hits before they land. However because the
animation of this move is always the same whether it hits anything or not, you
have to time it just right. If you time it to early then the opponent will
land before you can even recover from the animation, and if you do it too
late... well you can guess what happens.

When you get the timing right you character will bounce up and you can start
your move immediately. The difficulty of the combo you perform is up to you.
It can be as simple as performing one powerful attack after they bounce, or
treat it like a true juggle and do multiple attack. Regardless of what choice
you make the first move has to be fairly fast. For single moves you have
enough time to connect with a Wind God Fist, Stomach Rush or Double Axe Kick.
If you want to get fancier you will need to set them up with jab or 2 and then
follow up with an ender. It is also possible to connect with the complete Stun
Punch Rush combo ending with the uppercut as your setup and then tag on an
ender, but that is extremely difficult and takes perfect timing. It is well
worth it though because if you ever hit it on someone they will probably be in
awe because in all of my playing days I have yet to see someone do it besides
myself. Though I have passed on my knowledge to friends so I know there are
others who can do them.

Some of the best moves that you can catch your opponent with are Ling's
(f,f+3+4), Yoshimitsu's (QCF+1), King's (f+1+4) and a few others. It is even
possible to use the Electric Guard to setup flipover juggles but that is
insanely hard to do, especially during a real match against a good player.
I name these specifically because each of them give you enough time to see the
start of the animation and be able to react in time to start your Electric
Guard. You can theoretically use this technique against all aerial attacks
but most of them don't have a very long windup so you won't see them coming in
time enough
to react.

These combos are shown in the juggle combo list below.


|Juggle Combo List|

You've learned the basics of Jin juggle combos including the unconventional,
stun, flipover and electric guard versions so you should be able to start
creating your own. Before heading down to the arcade and trying everything
under the sun or firing up your PSX and camping out in practice mode for the
weekend you can take a look at the combos listed below. They give you a good
indication of what is possible so try building on top of them. Never assume
for an instant that the best combos have already been found because I
guarantee they haven't. Some of the best combos in Tekken 2 were never found
until the home version came out and people were able practice on juggles
extensively and even then some of those were only found months later.
There are practically 100's of possible Jin juggles so I'll just stick to a
few variations of every type. You should be able to figure out other options
similar to the ones listed.

The combos listed below are 100% unescapable if done as they are listed. There
are other resources on the internet that might list huge combos that claim to
do 100% damage, but most of them are escapable. All of my combos have been
tested on the PSX version with the opponent set to tech roll so the late
hitting bounce combos that were so popular in Tekken 2, but escapable in
Tekken 3, won't work. Keep that in mind when trying combos. If the opponent
can tech roll out of it then it ISN'T a true combo.

Key:

WGF   = Wind God Fist (f,N,d,d/f+2)
TGF   = Thunder God Fist (f,N,d,d/f+1)
EWGF  = Electric Wind God Fist (f,N,d,D/F+2)
qWS+2 = Quick WS+2(QCF+2 or QCB+2) explained in tips section

****************
*Basic Strategy*
****************

Now that we finally have all of Jin's moves and combos explained we can
start exploring his overall strategy. We're not ready to jump into all of
Jin's tricks yet as we must first get a grip on learning his basic feel. You
must feel comfortable in a match with Jin before you can start to try the
more advanced strategies so we'll cover the absolute basics first. If you
are already an experienced Tekken player who is just wanting to learn Jin
then this next section won't be of much help to you. It is more focused on
the beginner.


|When to block and when to not|

Knowing when to block and when to attack is perhaps the most important
factor in any fighting game. However it's not something that is easily
taught as it relies more on instinct than anything else. Therefore I won't
even try to cover it on a whole, I'll only try to point you in the right
direction when playing with Jin. If you've played other fighting games in
the past then you probably already have good fighting intuition and just
need it to be focused to a specific character.

Jin is a very well rounded character and performs well both offensively and
defensively. He can launch a barrage of offensive attacks that can bewilder
an opponent and find a way through their guard but he can also keep a cool
head and react to an opponents' attacks patiently watching for mistakes. A
good Jin player will incorporate both of these qualities seemlessly into
their style and understand the proper time to utilize either one.

With Jin's ability to do crouch dashing attacks along with his long distance
f,f style moves he is best played at a medium distance from the opponent. If
you get too far away he loses his effectiveness and if you are too close his
multitude of high attacks can get him in trouble. A medium distance will
allow him to get close to the opponent in an instant by  utilizing the
crouch dash and dash buffering techniques. I call this distance my "cushion"
and tend to fall back on it after an attack or defensive maneuver. It
doesn't mean you can't get in closer to your opponent. I like to keep a
constant offensive upper hand on my opponent which many times takes me up
very close. However the way Jin's attacks are engineered you almost always
stay at that cushion distance if the opponent blocks the attack which works
out great. I see a lot of people play similar to this but use too large of a
cushion. This is fine for defensiveness but it makes it harder to key upon
an opponents mistake because you are farther away. By the time you get your
attack off the opponent may have recovered which ruins your chance at the
attack.

The frequency in which you attack should be based on the kinds of attacks
you are using. Attacking too much using the wrong moves can be deadly to you
instead of the opponents. Constantly performing high attacks or simple
strings make it easy for an opponent to punish you. The safest style of
attacks are ones that hit mid or low level as the opponent has to either
completely evade it or interact with it in some way shape or form. Meaning
that you can't duck a mid attack so unless they actually evade it with a
sidestep or back dash, they will somehow make contact with that move. That
may mean blocking it, reversing it, interrupting it or being hit by it. High
attacks don't share this ability as they can be easily ducked and then
counter attacked. This shouldn't mean you never use high attacks because
they are very useful, only that the majority of attacks, especially smaller
ones, should be at mid and low levels.

Blocking is self explanatory as it is the single most important part of any
fighting game. If you can't effectively block an opponents attack then you
will face a quick death. The trick in Tekken is knowing when to utilize the
other defensive options such as reversing, evading or interrupting an
attack. That means that you must decide when it is better for you to attempt
these features instead of just blocking. Naturally these are more risky to
try but have larger pay-off's than a simple block. If you block most attacks
chances are it only effectively prevents you from getting hit with no means
of answering that attack. On the other hand these other options will allow
you to inflict your own damage which varies on which option you attempt.


|Reversals|

Reversals are probably one of the most popular defensive aspects in Tekken.
Most people love doing reversals because they look cool and do good damage
to the opponent. Learning to do them is not very hard as they are simple to
perform. The whole trick lies in knowing when to attempt them and when not.
In Tekken 2 reversals were absolute which meant once you performed one the
opponent was doomed. In Tekken 3 however that has changed with the addition
of the chicken. Now an alert opponent has the final chance and can
break your reversal. That means you have to be careful in your use of
reversals now whereas in Tekken 2 you could abuse them.

As far as deciding when the best times to attempt reversals is up to you.
The easiest places to perform a reversal are in strings when you know for
sure what the next attack is going to be and can prepare to catch it. This
is the easiest time but also risky for you as the opponent knows this as
well and will most likely be ready to chicken that reversal. Chickens
aren't easy to perform but an opponent expecting your reversal has a good
chance to successfully pull one off. This should stress the importance of
choosing your reversal attempts wisely. The best time to catch your opponent
unawares is the reverse the first move of a string. It happens so fast that
they most likely won't be able to react in time with a chicken. The
downside however is they are tough to time and you will be taking a risk by
guessing when they will attack. This game is about risks though so use that
intuition wisely.


|Interrupts|

It's clear with the addition of the chicken that Namco was urging
players to find other ways in stopping their opponents attack. They added
things like low parries and combo breaks in some characters but since Jin
doesn't have these we won't cover them. Something each character can do and
isn't really considered special is an interrupt. As the name implies it
simply means to interrupt your opponents attack with one of your own. This
is usually done with a quick attack like a jab or sweep. They don't do much
damage but when timed properly they will put an end to your opponents
attack. Interrupts are best used to break up stringed attacks in certain
openings. The most popular method is a crouching jab at the moment an
opponents string goes high or timing one between 2 slower attacks regardless
of their height. Interrupt timing is an acquired skill that must be gained
with experience. Interrupts are great because they are also absolute. Since
all you are doing it stopping your opponents attack they can't break it in
any way.

Once you get the hang of it you can even stop single attacks. A well timed
crouching jab can put an end to many special moves like Paul's Death Fist
and other slow initiating ones. Interrupting these moves are obviously risky
because if you miss-time it you might be eating a fist or foot but used
smartly they can catch an opponent off guard and give you a slight advantage
for the next attack.

Nothing in this section has probably been too eye opening for you but it
should give you an idea of what play style to strive for. Interrupts are
more important than reversals because they are absolute. However reversals
are quite important so long as you are adamant about using them in the right
situations so the opponent won't be ready to break it.


*******************
*Advanced Strategy*
*******************

We've covered all the basics, including the usefulness of each of Jin's
moves and which combos Jin is capable of performing. Now with this raw
information we can begin to sculpt your Jin skills. You have all of this
information in your head so know I'll finally begin to explain where to use
it. Obviously you didn't think these situations would simply present
themselves to you so I'll show you how to make them happen. The next few
sections will really be the meat of your Jin play style so be sure and try
to fully grasp the information in them.


|Custom Strings|

Custom strings are probably the one area of gameplay where you can be the
most creative and make your Jin different than others. We all know Jin's
special strings so using them in a match isn't going to surprise anyone
including your opponent. Once they learn how to block or interrupt your
strings they become for the most part worthless. Custom strings on the other
hand allow us to piece together our own concoction of moves in the order we
choose which your opponent won't know. This isn't as easy as it sounds
however as just putting a few moves together in order isn't a custom string.
An effective custom string blends together smaller moves in one smooth
motion with very small or even no definite points where an opponent can
attack. A well designed custom string will flow together as good or even
better than a real string. Some people refer to these as patterns but I
don't like that word because it's too negative. A pattern is something that
the opponent can learn and then figure a way out of. A successful custom
string has many options so that you can change them depending on the
reaction of your opponent. Building custom strings takes some
experimentation with what moves work well together but in the end the time
is well worth it.

Before we move on let me explain the reason for these strings. First of all
a custom string will keep your opponent on the defense with few chances to
do anything but defend themselves. A good string will be hard to reverse due
to the way the moves flow together as well as their unpredictability. They
are also used to set up certain situations like juggles, stuns or throws.
Keeping your opponent on the defensive will usually frustrate them and cause
them to attempt to escape. If they try to do it at the wrong time a good
string will catch them with a juggle, stun, throw, etc... Characters like
Ling and Nina are awesome at these custom combos because of their speed and
highly adjustable attacks. People often think of Jin as a power character
though he is much more effective when used with finesse and these custom
strings are just the trick to achieve that.

Like I mentioned before putting together strings takes some experimentation.
Some moves can be performed one after the other quickly while others have a
definite time between their executions. A good example is a crouch jab to a
rising right kick(d+1, WS+4) while a bad example would be a low sweep to a
standing jab(d+3, 1). While jabs are fast you would have to fully stand up
before hitting your button for the jab. On the other hand going from a
crouching jab to a rising right kick is very fast because you kick on the
way up from a crouch. Crouching jabs to rising attacks are usually very fast
as is standing attacks to crouching attacks. Many custom strings go from
high to low quite often because of the speed in which these types of moves
interact.

Another factor to think about is the distance the move will place you to
your opponent. Some attacks pull you closer to the opponent while others
push you out. 3 moves in a row that push you away from the opponent wouldn't
be very good for a custom string. To keep the string going you need to have
a few moves that put you close to the opponent and then you can work your
way back out. These strings can be short or long depending on the situation.
You might want to keep the pressure on the opponent and keep a string going
or you might get in trouble and want to use a short string to put you at a
safe distance. Regardless of the string you plan on using you must keep all
of these factors in mind to know what the string will accomplish.

Now that I've explained the different factors to look for in creating a
customs string I'll list some of Jin's moves that work well and for what
part of the string.


Forward momentum moves:

d/f+1,2
WS+1,2
b,f+2,1,[2_d+2]
1,1,2


Backwards momentum moves:

d/f+4,4
WS+4,4
1,2,4
f+4


Neutral moves that string well:

d/f+4
d/f+1
WS+4
WS+1
WS+2
d+1
d+4
F+2
D+1+2

None of this may make sense at first but as you start fooling around with
these strings you'll begin to see the pattern. I'll give a few example
strings and walk you through how and why they work. Then I'll list a good
amount of pre-configured strings to try as well as a few strings that set
you up for other situations.

Here is a very simple 5 hit custom string that virtually leaves no room for
the opponent to interrupt you:

d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+4,4

First of all the Twin Lancers is the perfect forward momentum move. It
carries Jin forward which puts you very close to the opponent. It's also a 2
hit combo so there isn't much chance of the opponent sneaking an attack
between them. Jin recovers immediately, and I do mean immediately, after the
second punch of the Twin Lancers so a d+1 is practically guaranteed. The d+1
is used because it is a very fast attack and also if the opponent blocked
the first attack there is a possibility the crouching jab might hit. From
the crouch jab we go right into a rising Ax Kick which again is very quick
and difficult to interrupt.

In no way is this whole string guaranteed to hit. It's purpose is to put the
opponent on the defensive, eat away at their damage and possibly take a big
hunk if the last part connects. The end of most custom strings is usually
where the hidden damage lies, either in the form of the move itself or the
chance that it might set up a juggle or stun. In this case the last rising
Ax Kick does over 30 points of damage if it hits. Not bad for a simple
string.

If we wanted to keep that string going longer we could have changed it up a
bit:

d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+4, d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+1, 1,1[2], d+1, etc....

This is an ultimate example of a simple but long string. Note that a string
of this length is by no means guaranteed to always work as the opponent
might interrupt you somewhere. However this whole string flows very smoothly
and has lots of opportunity for damage. We start out the same with the Twin
Lancers to get close to the opponent. Again a d+1 is used for it's speed but
also because mixing high, mid and low attacks are a must to keeping your
opponent guessing. After the crouching jab we change it up a bit and go into
a single standing right kick. This keeps us in decent range of the opponent
instead of the previous string where the rising Ax Kick put us at a
distance. The rising right kick recovers very quickly so going back into a
Twin Lancers is easy. This now puts us closer to the opponent and has begun
to wear their patience. From the Twin Lancers we crouch jab again but this
time we use a rising left punch. This keeps us a bit closer than the rising
right kick does and also lets the opponent know we are doing something
different. Notice that we could have actually risen into a whole Twin
Pistons combo(WS+1,2) which could result in a juggle if it connected.
However the Twin Pistons are a bit slow in recovering so using it would have
effectively ended the string. From the WS+1 we get a quick recovery in which
we go right into a 1,1[2]. These first 2 jabs are high which is the first
high attack we've used in the string. The opponent won't be expecting them
so there's a chance they might connect. If they do we finish the combo off
with the right punch. Remember that the Shining Fists have the delay feature
so we only have to finish if the first 2 jabs connect. If they connected the
string would have ended with the opponent being knocked down for some 30+
damage. However if they were blocked or ducked we would have went right down
into a quick d+1 and kept going from there.

That is a large example but nothing that hasn't been successfully used by me
before. The trick is the opponent is most likely trying to escape the string
somewhere along the line which is to your benefit. If they walk into an
attack it will most likely CH and make your next attack a sure thing. The
ultimate goal is to get them to walk into a damaging part of the string so
you keep it going until you get to that point or get knocked out of it.

It takes a lot of practice to be able to get the timing down between all the
moves and even more practice to be able to create them on the fly. I don't
go into a custom string knowing what I will do. I usually decide as I am
going along based on the opponents response. If they are successfully
blocking everything I might call off the attack and back myself away. On the
other hand if it seems to be hitting the opponent I might try to throw in a
big move on the chance it might connect.

Here are some more examples that I use to set up juggles and stuns:

d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+2

Very fast string that ends in a WS+2 uppercut. If they happen to keep
ducking after the jab or try to interrupt you the WS+2 uppercut will connect
giving you the most perfect juggle setup you could ask for. Short and sweet,
this simple string is one of my favorites.

d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+4, b,f+2,1(from here it depends on the outcome of the
b,f+2,1)

This combo setup is the greatest. If you get this far there are so many
options that you are bound to hit something. In the best case scenario your
opponent will try to attack after the rising kick and they'll walk right
into a stun punch that seemed to come out of nowhere. In this case you would
combo them using one of the previously discussed combos. If the stun punch
combo hits but doesn't stun or if they block it you have many choices. Since
this move brings you forward you should be close to your opponent. This is a
dangerous situation for them because you have so many possibilities. You
could immediately d+1 and continue the string as you see fit. They also know
that the third hit of the string hits mid so they won't be ducking. In this
case you can finish the string with a high move like 1,1,[2] or even catch
them off guard with a quick throw. The throw trick works quite well believe
me. And last but not least you can use the delay feature of the Stun Punch
Rush and do a late third punch which might catch them. If they are reversal
happy they might try to catch the last punch so delaying it would hit them
right about the time they miss the reversal. The delay alone in this move is
deadly enough but couple it with the ability to continue the custom string
or attempt a throw and most players are going to play it safe and block.
Assuming they block the third stun punch it would effectively end your sting
and put you at a safe distance. If you chose to do a delayed d+2 and it hit
you would have another juggle set up, and so on.....

There are so many possible outcomes to that situation alone you should see
how dangerous custom strings can be when used with moves that can be delayed
and cause stuns or juggles. I stun and juggle more opponents from variations
of this string that I do at any other time. The b,f+2,1[2_d+2] is an
invaluable tool in strings so it should be utilized with to its fullest. The
only real danger you face is getting the initial stun punch reversed, though
there is a way to keep that from happening using a chicken buffer that I'll
explain later on.

So now you see how strings work you can probably start coming up with your
own. I've prepared a decent amount of pre-configured custom strings for you
to try. I won't explain each one as most of you can see where I am going
with them. If you see a juggle starter embedded in there somewhere you can
guess that if that part hit the string would have ended and the juggle
performed. By the way you probably noticed that I always use the Twin Lancer
to start the custom strings. That's simply because it is the best at doing
so. You can also start them from other moves but I'll use the Twin Lancers
and you can just plug-in your own starters.

d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+2
d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+1,2
d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+4, b,f+2,1,
d/f+1,2, d+1, d+4, WS+4,4
d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+4, f,f+2
d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+1, d/f+1, d/f+4,4
d/f+1,2, d+1, d+4, D+1+2....
d/f+1,2, b,f+2, d+1, WS+4
d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+1, 1,2,4
d/f+1,2, d+1, WS+2, f+4
etc....


|Chicken Buffering|

A chicken is a basically the act of breaking out of an attempted reversal. The
reason it is nicknamed a "chicken" is because that is what the announcer says
if you successfully perform one. Chickens are generally only used at the
higher levels of play as they require great reflexes and a bit of expectation.
The expectation of a reversal is what chicken buffering is all about. Guessing
that your opponent is going to attempt a reversal and then being prepared for
it.

In short, you perform a chicken by the opposite motion of a reversal, and the
buttons you use depends on the side on which you attack. Meaning that you
perform them with either f+1+3 or f+2+4 though it requires you to know which
arm or leg your opponent is attempting to reverse. A left punch/kick reversal
attempt requires you to use f+1+3 to successfully chicken it, while a right
punch/kick requires you to use f+2+4. Being aware of which arm or leg all
of Jin's moves are performed with is an obvious must.

To buffer a chicken simply tag the correct chicken motion on to the end of
your move or a point in the string that you are most likely to get reversed.
It is impossible to buffer a chicken on every single move in Jin's arsenal,
but in time you will begin to see which moves and at what times your opponents
will generally attempt a reversal. That is the key to buffering chickens and
when done correctly and can make your opponents extremely shy of using
reversals which allows you more freedom of which moves or strings you wish to
use. You are only given a few frames in which to input your chicken command
so you must be precise and learn the exact timing.

With that out of the way we can get down to business and list which of Jin's
moves are best suited for buffering. Like I said, you simply can't chicken
buffer every single one of Jin's moves so the best candidates need to be
narrowed down. They are as follows:

f,f+2
f,f+3
1,2,3(last kick only)
f,N,d,d/f+1
f+3
4
b,f+2,1,[2+d+2](first and 3rd hit only)
F+2
d/f+4,4
WS+4,4
WS+2

There are probably a few others you might be able to effectively buffer so
its up to you. Obviously you don't need to reversal buffer against
characters without a reversal though you may want to for sheer practice.
Also there is no need to buffer if you know that the attack is going to be
hit or impossible to reverse. If you suspect a reversal or aren't quite sure
you should definitely use the reversal buffer.

|Tactics|

Just like all other characters, Jin has certain tactics that work well
regardless if your opponent is aware of them or not. These are generally
situations that you put your opponent in danger that are of low risk to you
and require them to be quick on their reflexes to decide how to respond.
Custom strings do this to an extent but they are meant to be used randomly
whereas these specific tactics are used the same way everytime, only you will
be choosing a different way to follow them up to keep your opponent on their
toes. There are many of these but I'll cover a few of the popular ones to
give you an idea.

||Shoot the Works mixup||

By itself the shoot the works combo (1,2,3,[4_f+4]) isn't that great of a
string however there is one quality that you can use to your advantage. The
third hit of the string which is the left ax kick, will guard stun your
opponent if they block it. This means you will be ending the shoot the works
combo on the third kick as there is really no reason to ever go beyond that
kick. If the third kick connects it will set you up for a nice juggle and if
it is blocked it will guard stun them and allow you to plan your next move.
That is where the tactic comes in to play. Since you have the advantage while
they are still in the guard stun animation you can begin your next move before
they recover and they will be forced to defend themselves in some way. The
tactic is to mixup your next move between high, mid and low attacks. Mid and
low are more recommended but it won't hurt to throw in a high attack once in
awhile to keep them guessing.

Remember though there is a small delay after the first set of 1,2 punches
before your third kick will come out. Therefore your opponent will have enough
time to reverse or parry that kick if they wish to try. If they have perfect
timing they might be able to interrupt it with a quick jab or other fast move
but that puts them at great risk because if they mistime it then the kick with
CH and set you up for a rather nice damaging juggle. Also remember that you
can buffer a chicken into this ax kick so you can *always* escape an attempted
reversal, unless of course your opponent is King in which you really shouldn't
attempt this tactic at all. The same goes for Law as he can always parry the
third kick and gain advantage over you. Other than that you can feel safe
about using the tactic on everyone else.

Here is a quick rundown of possible situations you might encounter attempting t
his
tactic. These are the bread and butter options but there are many more and you
might find something different that works particularly well for you.

You perform 1,2,3(chicken buffered - f+1+3)

   -Opponent gets hit by the third kick which opens you up for any of the
   juggles that will follow up a standard f,f+3.

   -Opponent blocks third hit which gives you the advantage of following up
   with a quick attack:
       -Stomach Rush(chicken buffered - f+2+4)
           -Opponent attempts to reverse Stomach Rush but due to your
           buffered chicken you escape the reversal.
           -Opponent gets hit by move and loses 37 points of damage
           minimum and more if it connects as CH.
       -Hell Sweep
           -Opponent blocks but you are a safe distance away from a
           guaranteed counter attack.
           -Opponent gets hit by Hell Sweep and allows you to follow up
           with any of the listed Hell Sweep juggles.
           -Opponent low parries your Hell Sweep and in worst case
           scenario sets you up for a large juggle.
       -Throw (most likely Stonehead[f,f+1+2] due to dash buffer-ability)
           -Opponent escapes throw.
           -Throw connects and you follow up with half ax kick trick
           for an easy 40+ points of damage.
       -Wind God Fist(chicken buffered - f+2+4)
           -Opponent blocks WGF but you are a safe distance from
           guaranteed counter attack.
           -Opponent attempts to reverse WGF but due to your buffered
           chicken you escape the reversal.
           -WGF connects and you follow up with your favorite WGF combo
           and send them on their way with a coke and a smile.

   -Opponent attempts to reverse the third hit but due to your chicken buffer y
ou
   escape the reversal. Again this won't work against King or Law.


|The Art of Okizeme|

Okizeme is a Japanese term which basically means attacking your opponent
while on the ground. Players often call this "cheap" though with practice
it's very easy to escape. It is realistic however to have this type of
fighting system in Tekken because not letting an opponent get up is quite a
real phenomenon in street and tournament fighting. You don't give your
opponent mercy when they fall, you go for the kill or try to keep them
there. It comes to no surprise that this is a very popular part of Tekken
gameplay. It is very good at slaughtering novice players who insist on
constantly tech rolling. We won't cover how to get up safely, as I consider
that to be a basic skill, though we will cover Jin's ability to keep
opponents down.

Jin has a few attacks that are good at keeping opponents down, one of which
even juggles. They are as follows:

1+4,2...
d/f+4,4
f,f+2
f,N,d,D/F+4
4~3

The single best move to use is the White Heron Combo(1+4,2...) because if
timed right it will juggle the opponent in the air and let you perform a
small combo. Keep in mind they might roll away or even kick you while
getting up so there is always a risk to trying to catch them. The best time
to try it is immediately after the opponent hits the ground and attempts to
roll. If you are next to the opponent and you time the move as they twitch
it will catch them and bring them up off the ground. The White Heron Combo
will act the same way as if you performed it in an unconventional combo.
That means you could do 1+4,2, f,f+2 while they were getting up. This is a
nice hunk of damage for simply catching someone who gets up to early. The
d/f+4,4 works the same way but it doesn't juggle. It is very quick however
and takes a nice hunk of damage.

The Stomach Rush(f,f+2) is an unlikely move to punish rising opponents but
it works great on opponents who like to roll back. If you're playing someone
who seems to roll backwards every time they get up you can hit them with the
Stomach Rush every time. Just time it as soon as they twitch and it will
knock them right out of the roll.

The last 2 moves are meant to be used to hit the opponent while they are
still on the ground. I bring these up because once you get in an Okizeme war
with someone it will turn into a guessing game. They might play dead on the
ground waiting for you to attack so they can punish you. In these times its
good to just do a quick ground attack because they are wide open for it.
Like I said it's a guessing game so picking the right move for the situation
is often a little bit of intuition and a lot of luck. Making the right
decision could gain you some extra damage while making the wrong one might
backfire on you.

There is one more feature of Okizeme that actually deals more with the
instant they actually rise. In this technique you aren't actually keeping
them down but instead waiting until the instant they stand up and then
attacking. The Hell Sweep is the best weapon for this technique though it is
very difficult to time and highly dangerous if you get it wrong. Most
players have a nasty habit of automatically standing up after they rise
which leaves them open for a low attack. The object is to enter the crouch
dash while they are rising and time the Hell Sweep to hit the instant they
get up. When it works correctly they will immediately get tripped up and you
can perform one of your Hell Sweep combos. On the other hand if you start
the crouch dash too early and the opponent rolls to the side your side might
be left wide open to the opponent. This often results in a side throw which
is not in your best interest. Obviously this technique is risky but works
quite well once you get the hang of it.



|Tricks of the Trade|

As I mentioned in previous sections Jin has a good number of tricks up his
sleeve that can add extra damage to a wide variety of attacks and
situations. In order to make your Jin as strong as possible you must learn
these tricks and use them to their full extent. Some of these tricks I have
already mentioned in previous sections but I'll place them here again just
so you can give them all a quick glance to make sure you catch them all.


||Throw to Half Ax Kick||

Just as the name implies you can initiate a throw and then connect with a
half ax kick(d/f+4) before they recover for an extra 10 points of damage.
This trick only works with the Stonehead(f,f+1+2) and Bitch Kicks(1+3)
throws and the timing for both is a bit different. It is very easy to do
after the Stonehead but slightly harder after the Bitch Kicks as the window
of time is shorter. Simply time the ax kick the instant Jin recovers from
the throw animation. Your opponents feet will still be in the air at that
time so the ax kick will clip them. A cool side effect of this trick is that
it will magically flip your opponent  180 degrees so their head will be
towards you. This means they are limited to only a few rising attacks giving
you the advantage. Seeing that this adds 10 damage points to your throw with
no chance of the opponent escaping you would be stupid not to utilize it at
every opportunity.


||Shiho-Rage to Hell Sweep||

Like the above tricks, it is also possible to get an extra free hit on
the end of Jin's Shiho-Rage throw(d/f+2+3) as it leaves the opponent unable to
rise for a short amount of time. After performing the throw simply initiate
a Hell Sweep as quick as you can. If you do it right you will get an extra
hit in which brings up your total damage to 60 points. The timing is more
difficult than the above throw tricks but the payoff is worth it.


||Shining Fists Delay||

You already know about the moves that can be delayed so let me stress the
importance of this feature when used with the Shining Fists(1,1,2). This is
Jin's quickest punch combo that can't be blocked once initiated and always
knocks the opponent down. It does 30 points of damage so when you couple
that with the ability to make it a low risk maneuver it makes it even more
powerful. The simple trick is to not finish the last punch until you know
the first 2 have connected. Since the last punch has a slow recovery it is
imperative that you always use this trick to keep from being clobbered after
they block it. By simply performing the 1,1 command you can decide to stop
or finish the combo. If they block it you can recover quickly from those
jabs and if it connects you simply tap 2 to finish the combo. This trick
should become second nature to you as it makes the combo 100% less risky.


||Alternate Tackle||

Jin's tackle isn't quite as useful in Tekken 3 as his father's was in Tekken
2 because of the ease of breaking tackles in general. However there are a
few tricks that can help to surprise your opponent by performing it in
awkward situations. The official way to perform his tackle is [d/b_d+1+2]
but what most people don't know is that it can be initiated from a crouch as
well as a crouch dash. That means that while you are crouching you can
simply tap 1+2 to go directly into the tackle. Or even better you can hold
down while in the crouch dash and tap 1+2 to start the tackle. Both are much
more useful than the standard way that can be seen coming a mile away. The
ducking one can be used to do a quick tackle after interrupting an attack
with a crouching jab or sweep. As soon as you recover from the jab a quick
tackle might throw them off guard enough to where they don't break the
tackle. Using it in the crouch dash is great because it extends the range of
the tackle as well as throwing opponents off guard. If they see a crouch
dash the last thing they will be looking for is a tackle. They will be
worrying about a Wind God Fist or Hell Sweep so performing a tackle might
throw them off guard enough to complete the tackle.


||Crouch Dash to Stomach Rush||

This is a fairly unknown trick that may not be as useful as others but I
feel you should at least know of it. As the title implies you can go into a
Stomach Rush(f,f+2) directly from a crouch dash in one smooth motion. Its
usefulness may not seem readily apparent but knowing it can give you another
variance of the crouch dash in your arsenal. Performing as many different
moves as possible from the crouch dash will keep your opponent guessing at
all times and dissuade them from trying to reverse or interrupt you. The
motion required for this trick is simply [f,N,d,d/f,f,F+2]. Seems a bit
difficult but in reality it's one smooth motion. Just perform the crouch
dash like normal though end it in the forward position instead of down
forward. Many of you probably do that now without realizing it. Then once
that motion is complete tap F+2 quickly. When done correctly Jin will do a
crouch dash and then execute the Stomach Rush immediately out of it. This
gives you more distance with the Stomach Rush but slows down the total
execution time. It's greatest advantage is variance from the crouch dash.


||Rising Ax Kick Utilization||

As I mentioned in the move descriptions, the rising variety of the Ax Kicks
take more damage than the standing ones. Simply meaning that WS+4,4 takes
more damage than d/f+4,4 meaning you should attempt to use the rising
version as much as possible. To stress the importance of this be aware that
d/f+4,4 does 26 points of damage while WS+4,4 does 34 points. The difference
in damage can quickly add up so striving for the WS version is important.

Obviously the d/f version is much easier to do in combos and in general
gameplay but there is a trick in making the WS version much more useful.
Instead of trying to crouch quickly then perform it you can tack it on to
the end of a crouch dash giving it a longer range and faster execution time
from a standing position. Doing it from a crouch is obviously not a problem
but remember we are trying to use it in situations where we normally use the
d/f+4,4. This is most prominent in juggle combos where damage is very
important. The way the crouch dash trick works is that we are actually going
into a crouch and then rising into the ax kick like normal. The difference
being that we are using a special command to accomplish it. The correct
command would be [f,N,d,d/f,N+4,4] which is one smooth motion. It follows
the same rules as normal crouch dash attacks meaning you can initiate it
anywhere in the dash. That gives the rising Ax Kick more variety than the
standing version. Not only does it do more damage but has more range and
when performed quickly in the crouch dash it is almost as fast.

Using the WS version of the Ax Kick instead of the standing version in any
possible situation is something that you should strive to achieve. Doing
that extra damage at every chance might give you the added advantage to win
a match that comes down to the wire.


||Face Down Sweep Combos||

As with most characters Jin can start a combo from a sweep initiated while
rising from the face down position. You don't run across that situation very
often but when it does present itself you should make the best of it. Most
of the time it will occur when you are throw by certain characters,
especially Hwoarang. When you are lying face down simply tap left kick to
perform a special sweep that knocks the opponent off their feet but keeps
them close to you. You also recover instantly from the sweep and can perform
a juggle combo. In Jin's case he can perform any of the standard
unconventional combos listed in this guide either by rising into half of his
Ax Kick(WS+4) or by starting the White Heron Combo(1+4,2..). This
opportunity won't happen to often so make sure you take advantage of it when
the time comes.


||Alternate WS Motion||

The WS motion is a very important motion as a couple of Jin's best attacks are
started with it. The only problem is that you have to duck first in order to
do them and that takes a bit of time which takes some of the usefulness out
of the moves. Well there is a little trick that allows you to perform this
motion without consciously ducking down and rising again. Simply perform a
fireball motion, forward or backwards, and tack the button that corresponds to
the WS move that you want to peform on the end of it. So QCF+2 or QCB+2 is the
same as ducking down and then doing WS+2. The exact timing is tricky and you
have to perform the motion a bit slow but it allows you to pull those moves
out of your hat a little fast than fully ducking first. If done correctly Jin
will seem to not really duck all the way down, but instead the move will just
come out as if he did it from a standing position. You can imagine how useful
this trick could be. I suggest doing the fireball motion backwards as it seems
to work a little better.


||Hold Directions For Faster Executions||

It has been a little known secret since Tekken 1 that holding certain
directions while performing a move that requires none can make that move
initiate a few frames faster. While that alone may sound insignificant
it can make doing those difficult combos much easier and allow you to have
a better chance of hitting an opponent while they are on the ground.

In the days of Tekken 2 it was possible for Kazuya to connect with his
flip kick(4~3) at the end of almost every combo. Most people didn't believe
this because without using this trick the opponent could rise a few frames
before the kick connected. However by tapping u/f+4~3, Kazuya was able to
start the move just a few frames earlier than using just 4~3 and the hit
became guaranteed. The reason it worked is because you couldn't start the flip
kick until you recovered from the previous moves' animation. Tapping u/f while
doing the 4~3 actually broke you free from the animation a few frames faster
than if you had only done the buttons by themselves.

Bring that knowledge to Tekken 3 and it does indeed help Jin out as well.
While the flip kick is very seldom guaranteed in Tekken 3 it will still
initiate faster with the u/f motion than with buttons alone. However that is
not the only move that works with this trick. Standing jabs and the White
Heron combo also work very well. Holding forward while performing a jab, most
likely after a juggle starter, will allow you to jab a few frames faster than
normal allowing you to get a bit more height with your juggles. Many of you
probably do this already and don't even realize it is helping you out.

The White Heron combo is perhaps the most important way to use this move as it
allows you to do you Hell Sweep and Ax Kick combos more profficiently. Many
people complain that after a Hell Sweep they can't perform some of the tougher
combos because the White Heron doesn't knock them up high enough. A good
example is this combo:

f,N,d,D/F+4, 1+4, 1,1,2

Without using any movement on the controller when initiating the 1+4 part
directly after the Hell Sweep it is unlikely you will knock them high enough
to connect with the jabs. However if you simply tap f+1+4 instead, it will
initiate the White Heron just a few frames faster thus knocking your opponent
a tiny bit higher which makes it possible to finish the combo. You might be
able to get a jab in without using the trick, but it is much more difficult.
The whole idea of this trick is to make it easier to perform those difficult
to time combos.


||Diving Stun||

Most people realize that when you perform a dive while getting up it will
stun your opponent for a second if they block it. What they don't realize is
you can perform small combos by taking advantage of your opponents inability
to move. There are several ways to start these combos, but the move has to be
extremely fast. I suggest a standing jab, preferably a right one as it does
more damage, a ducking jab or even a knee.

Obviously some of these tricks will be more useful than others, however you
should utilize each and every one of them when you have the opportunity.
Gaining that extra damage or other types of advantage at all times is the key
to winning against other high level players where every health point makes a
difference.



|Make the Best Out of Every Opportunity|

This is sort of the cardinal rule for fighting games in general but I see so
many people not follow it I feel I must stress its significance. It is
important with any character to follow this rule but this section is
narrowed down to its importance with Jin. Since Jin is more of a finesse
character than a power character like Paul you can't rely on a few highly
damaging moves to win a round. You might get lucky and get a big combo off
once in awhile but most of the time you will have to eat away at your
opponents damage and take advantage of any openings you see. I put the tips
section right before this one on purpose. These are examples of situations
that you should take full advantage of whenever possible. The next time you
lose a match to an opponent who has little energy left remember that had you
used those tricks you probably would have won the match.

Since there are endless possible situations I'll just list a few general
tips for common situations.


|Ducking High Attacks|

Anytime you duck an opponents high attack or attempted throw you should
counter with a WS+2. You already know that it is his best juggle starter so
you can do just about anything you want after it. It's very quick so
sneaking it in after ducking an attack is quite easy but very few times do I
see a Jin player utilize it. If your opponent attacks high, including in
strings, then you should answer with a WS+2 to teach them a lesson. The same
goes for any attempted throw including multi-parts. If King goes for a multi
and you duck it then make him pay for his mistake. Never under any
circumstance should you counter a ducked attack with a throw. That is a
waste of an excellent opportunity for large amounts of damage.


|Interrupt Unblockables|

You should never throw, reverse or try to back out of an opponents slow
initiating unblockable. Moves like Yoshimitsu's sword slashes are the
exception because of their speed but his stabs along with unblockables like
Paul's, Nina's, Law's and even Jin's should not go unpunished. They are slow
to initiate and will give you an automatic CH when you connect. Some
characters can cancel their unblockables but that won't put you in danger as
they still have the cancel animation which is quite long. As long as you
react fast you are almost guaranteed to hit so make the best use of the
situation. We know that most likely it will be an CH so the Stun Punch Rush,
or rather the first 2 hits, are the prime candidates. You CH with those and
it's an automatic stun and most likely a huge combo. Even a simple combo
like the Shining Fists is better than trying to get away from the character
or attempting a throw.


|Punish a Whiffed Attack|

Anytime your opponent completely whiffs a special move or attack you should
punish them in some way, shape or form. If the attack is a jab or something
similar you won't be able to do much but if it's a big move you can do some
serious counter attacking. For instance if Nina attempts her Divine
Cannon(d/b+4,3) a little too far away and the second kick misses she is wide
open for at attack. A quick Stomach Rush(f,f+2) should be the absolute
minimum response whereas a quick Wind God Fist or Hell Sweep is the best. If
you can do the Super Wind Godfist then that is the ultimate response because
of its speed, range, damage and ability to juggle. This again stresses the
importance of mastering the crouch dash. If the opponents move keeps them in
a crouching position after they miss like Yoshimitsu's Spinning
Sweep(D,d/f+3) the Hell Sweep followed by a combo is probably a safer
response.


These examples should get you started in the right direction. Finding the
best response in the other many situations you'll encounter is up to you.
Not all situations may have a simple guaranteed answer but to become a top
Jin player it is imperative that you take full advantage of the ones that
do.


*************************
*Putting It All Together*
*************************

Now that you have all of this raw information it's time to actually put it
together in one smooth play style. You are probably expecting this section
to give you the magical ingredient in doing that but in fact this section
will be brief. I simply can't explain to you 'HOW' to play. You know the
strengths and weaknesses of his moves and strings, his best juggle combos,
how to use reversal buffers, how to construct custom strings, learned a few
tricks and the best times to use them but after all of that information it
is ultimately up to you to put it together. I can point you in the right
direction but since I'm not there to hold your hand you have to take the
last step. Think of it as a large puzzle and I just gave you all the
necessary pieces to complete it or perhaps a large block of wood that I've
carved a basic shape and it's up to you to add all of the details. I've done
just about everything possible on paper to help you out but your success
will depend on your own skills and ingenuity.


|Should I play offensively or defensively?|

Again this is up to you. While I believe that each character might excel in
one aspect I won't tell you that you can't succeed using another. You must
know how to play both ways and adapt accordingly. I myself prefer to be
offensive though I have played quite a few very good defensive Jin players.
Pick the style that is most comfortable to you and exploit it. Or better yet
learn both styles and mix between them to keep your opponent baffled.


|Should I take chances or play it safe?|

Again this is a personal preference but I have seen no top level players win
repeatedly without taking chances. What makes some players better than
others is their instinct for knowing when to take chances and when to play
it safe. Players who constantly play it on the safe side tend to get to a
certain level and never pass it. By experimenting and taking calculated
risks you can become a better player and never stop learning. I still to
this day learn new things that I had never even thought of and it's because
I refuse to fall into one type of play style and I never play it too safe.
Conservatives can become good but to become great you have to take risks.

*Epilogue*
**********

You've finally reached the end of this guide so hopefully you've learned
something by now. If you are a beginner to Jin you've probably bit off a bit
more than you can chew at first but just take your time and learn different
sections at once. Get a feel for his moves, learn to juggle with proficiency
and then go from there. If you are an old pro at Jin then hopefully I've
given you some new insight to playing him in a different style or at least
some bit of information that you weren't aware of. I'm sure there's quite a
bit of things I'm not aware of yet so I'll probably be adding to this guide
in time.

*Useless Information*
*********************

This section contains completely worthless information to learning to play
Jin. However you should know a bit about your character if you want to learn
to the extent intended by this guide.


|Storyline|

At the age of 15 he knew that he was Kazuya Mishima's son and at the same
time he lost his mother Jun Kazama. Jin trained himself under the
supervision of Heihachi every day with the intention of defeating the "God
of Fighting" who is supposed to have killed his mother. For him, Heihachi
was his grandfather and also a reliable "teacher".

Four years have passed, and Jin Kazama is 19 years old now. Mastering the
Kazama style of Judo  and Mishima style Fighting Karate, Jin starts to take
action as a martial artist.
