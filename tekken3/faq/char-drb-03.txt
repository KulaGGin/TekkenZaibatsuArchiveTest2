INTRODUCTION
============

If there's one thing in Tekken 3 that is still rather unexplored, it has to Doctor Boskonovitch.
Especially his True Stance ability, being one of the most extraordinary techniques in Tekken, 
lacks any kind of in-depth documentation. No wonder, since True Stance is unpractical, hard to 
perform and usually Dr.B isn't even considered as a real character. None the less I've always 
found him interesting and as I know the character and True Stance quite well, I thought I'd 
correct the situation. A few years too late, I know, but better late than never.




WHAT IS TRUE STANCE?
====================

Although Dr.B already has quite a few moves in his arsenal, True Stance gives him a handful more
by making him able to mimicrise Heihachi. In True Stance Dr.B stands up properly instead of 
crouching, and he is able to perform almost any Heihachi's move. He can also walk, jump and throw
with the basic 1+3 and 2+4 inputs. Usuallly True Stance last only a split second and after an
attack Dr.B always suffers a fall back animation which leads to his normal stance. This means
that juggling with True Stance moves is extremely limited.

Getting out of Doctor's normal crouching stance is the key requirement in entering True Stance.
He does that only on two occasions: (1)  Dr.B gets hits by a move or blocks one or (2) Dr.B turns
around from back turned position. This also means that there are two different methods to enter
True Stance:  The harder and more versatile method called 'Duck to True Stance' and the easier
method known as 'Turn to True Stance'. Both will be explained separately.




DUCK TO TRUE STANCE
===================

This is the better method to enter True Stance. It allows Dr.B to walk in True Stance and
perform Heihachi's crouch dash moves. This method also requires good timing which makes it much
harder compared to the 'Turn to True Stance' method. All sources I've come up with state that
Dr.B has to get hit by a low move to enter True Stance. This is a common misbelief, although
entering True Stance may become easier that way.


Entering
ииииииии
One of Doctor B's properties is that after blocking or taking a hit he starts to fall back. If,
and only if, the opponent performs a high attack while Dr.B is still recovering from the previous
hit, you can cancel the fall back by tapping d. You can also hold D for a split second but
holding D too long makes him side step after the high move has whiffed. Tapping d too early or
not holding it long enough makes Dr.B take the high hit. Correct timing results in a successful
duck and Dr.B is in True Stance.


Attacks
иииииии
With perfect timing 'duck to True Stance' leaves Dr.B in Heihachi's normal standing position.
However if D is held even a little too long he will be left in 'while standing' position and a
button input results one of Heihachi's WS-moves. WS-position can be canceled back to standing
position  by tapping f. Various other cancels are also possible, a complete list can be seen
below. It is essential that all commands after a successful duck are inputted immediately.

Command:        Movement:
f               standing position (Heihachi's normal stance)
f,n,d,df        crouch dash
f,n,d,df,uf     Mishima hop
UF_U_UB         jump (lands to WS like all jumps and hops)
F#              walk forward
 = n             = standing position
 = UF_U_UB       = jump
 = uf            = hop
 = hcb#          = walk back (keep holding B, hard to perform)
B#              walk back (equals standing position but directional inputs are not possible)
 = UF_U_UB       = jump
 = uf            = hop


As mentioned before, in True Stance Dr.B can perform most of Heihachi's moves but not all of them.
The greatest limitation is Dr.B's unability to perform any moves that require an f,f motion.
QCF-motion, taunt (2+3+4) and all moves starting with b are also impossible to perform. A list of
all exeptions regarding True Stance moves can be found below.

Command:                Move:                   Note:
f,f+1+2                 Stone Head              Not possible
f,f+1+4                 Headbutt Carnival       Not possible
f,f+3                   Split Axe Kick          Not possible
f,f,N+3                 Delayed Split Axe Kick  Not possible
f,f+2                   Demon Godfist           Not possible
b,b,N+3+4               Shadow Step             Not possible
b+2                     Demon Boar              Not possible
qcf+2                   Deathfist               Not possible
2+3+4                   Anger Taunt             Not possible
d+1+4                   Demon Tile Splitter     Not possbile (equals d+4)
1+2                     Demon Breath            Must be done 2~1
d+4                     Geta Stomp              Must be done df+4.
                                                d+4 results a Tile Splitter (d+1)
                                                which knocks Dr.B down.
4~3                     Demon Scissors          No damage to Dr.B when whiffed
uf+3,4                  Hell Axe                Comes out as Heihachi's uf+3+4
f,F,2,1,2,2,3,4,4,1,2,1 Tenstring               Not possible


Duckable moves
ииииииииииииии
Whether a high move can be ducked to True Stance or not depends on the frame advantage given by
the previous move. If an attack gives frame advantage to the attacker the next high move can be
usually ducked to True Stance. This is often the case in pre-canned attack strings. It's a fact
that all moves have different properties on hit and on block and majority of attack strings
require Dr.B to get hit by certain moves.

Notice that attack strings that have multiple high attacks in a row allow Dr.B to stay ducked by
holding D. Normally holding D would result in a side step but in this case Dr.B stays ducked
until the last high attack in the string has whiffed. There are exceptions to this rule,
especially delayable high moves tend to end the crouch.

Below I have listed all attack strings in the game that can be ducked to True Stance. Common
property in all of them is that they contain at least one high hit and the initial attack leaves
the attacker in frame advantage. Note that in order to block or get hit or by some high moves you
need to tap b or f respectively. 

How to read the tables:
- Moves that can be ducked to True Stance are in square brackets [ ]. 
- Duckable custom strings can be created by joining any 
  of the starters and any of the enders together.
- At least the last attack before a duckable attack must connect.
  For example Law's second kick in 4,3,[4] string
  must hit in order to be able to duck the last kick.

TURN TO TRUE STANCE
===================

Turning to True Stance differs from the other method a lot. Timing isn't anywhere near as strict
and Dr.B can enter True Stance on his own since he is not dependant on the other characters
actions. Easiness comes with a price which in this case is Dr.B's unability to walk in True
Stan and perform certain moves that are possible using the other method.

Entering True Stance using this method starts by moving Doctor B to back turned position. The
easiest way to do this is using his Reverse Panik Charge move (b+3+4) which turns him around. Now
that Dr.B's back is facing the opponent you should start moving Doctor towards the opponent by
holding F. Doctor rises up a little, takes two steps and turns around. Right after the second
step has ended and while Dr.B is turning around, he is in True Stance and is able to perform
almost any Heihachi's move that requires a single direction input or no direction at all. The
only movement option he has is a jump which can be performed by pressing UF, U or UB. Timing for
the jump towards the opponent is very slack as UF can be held from the end of the first step.
List of exceptions exclusive to 'Turn to True Stance' method can be found below. Refer to the
'Duck to True Stance' section to find out all the exceptions.

Command:        Move:                   Note:

uf+4,4          Rising Sun              Not possible
