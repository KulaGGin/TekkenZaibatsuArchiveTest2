I am Dino Trnka(Dinaga).I am from Bosnia and Herzegovina(BiH),so sorry if you 
find some typing errors,I`m still learning English.If you really want to find
more about me,e-mail me.This is my first,and my best FAQ(yet).I will maybe
make some more Tekken FAQs,because I just LOVE Tekken!
My e-mail is dinaga@bih.net.ba .Feel free to e-mail me if you want to 
ask something,or give a support.
You CAN put this FAQ on your site without my permission,but only in its FULL 
FORM.If you put your name on it,pray,because you will be roughly punished.If 
you want to ask anything,give a critic or support,e-mail me.Don`t send any
information which should be in FAQ,cause I finished it,and I won`t update 
it anymore.One more thing,if you don`t like phrase «Yoshi» instead of

I made this FAQ because I think Yoshi deserve much more FAQs.He is,in my 
opinion,best character in all of Tekken.He really looks weird,but he can be 
deadly in hands of a expert.Most people pick him because he has the sword,
but his abilities don`t stop there.He has the BEST arsenal of attacks than 
any other Tekken character.Every character has 5-6 GOOD moves,but Yoshi has 
them so much that you will use all of them,because they ALL have purpose for 
particural situation!He has the BEST Basic Uppercut,has GREAT juggles,he has 
the best arsenal of unblockables,and he can HEAL!If you know when to heal,
you will easily beat alot of opponents quickly!He also has alot of good long
attacks,but he has GREAT close-range attacks too!Yoshi isn`t easy to play,so 
if you are masher or begginer,start learning!If you don`t want to learn,then 
know one thing:Yoshi is NOT for mashers.In that case,please delete this FAQ,
cause you don`t need it.
I will try to make your Yoshi`s tacticts better,and to explain how to
use his attacks,when,in what situation,and how.If this FAQ isn`t clear enough
for the first time,read it 2-3 times to learn how to play Yoshi effectively.
Yoshi is hard to learn,but when you learn all of his moves,you will easily 
make your own tactics.When I was apsolute begginer all I knew was his Triple 
Roundhouses(4,4,4)so mashers ate me in 10-20 seconds.But when I read tons of 
FAQs,i realized i need a new tactic.Use all of his moves,but always know what 
move you will use in particural situation.So,if you are smart,you won`t do 
his Sword Stab if you are close by enemy,and you won`t Basic uppercut a 
fallen opponent(ohh...).Practice,and you will soon be an Expert.
Yoshi is my favourite character since Tekken 1,and I think he is hardest to
learn how to play effectively,but when you learn,he is most deadly in the 
hands of a master!

*****************************************************************************
His stances are VERY USEFUL,every stance,if used in right time,can be deadly 
for your opponent
*****************************************************************************
Yoshi doesn`t have a lot of stances(like Lei),but every of his stances is 
useful for particural situation.
-His Pogo Stick stance (U+1+2)can kill Gon mashers or Dr.Bosconovitch users 
in no time!You can`t be thrown either,and all low attacks won`t hit Yoshi!
Enemies will hit themselves if they try to low attack you!
-His Bad Breath stance (B+1+2)can be like shield,you can combo from it,
it is unblockable,enemy can`t duck it,can`t counter it,and they can`t throw
you while in it!
-His Sword Debate Stance (SS+3+4)can heal you,you can take life from enemy,
or give life to enemy!
-His Indian Style stance (D+3+4)is also very useful and fully unpredictable.
You can heal,attack,teleport,stand up(heh).
-His hopping Sword stance (d/b+1,N,D/B)is very good,and if Yoshi make enough
hops,it can do 100 damage to opponent!
*****************************************************************************
He has easiest strings,and all of them end in unblockables
*****************************************************************************
-Let`s see his 1214441111 string.Yoshi does 3 punches,3 kicks,again punch,and 
3 unblockables!This is easiest string in Tekken 3 and it is quite useful.
-His 12141114111 string:3 punches,kick(oh),dizzy Yoshi,kick again,punch,and 2 
unblockables!This string can make your opponent very angry because hit range 
always changes,so they just CAN`T block your entire string.
*****************************************************************************
He has by far best unblockables in the game!
*****************************************************************************
Every unblockable has his own purposes,and can be used in doubt to fool the 
enemy.
-His basic unblockable,Sword Stab(b,b+1)is very slow,but it has great range,
and if you guess it won`t hit the enemy,and enemy is waiting for unblockable 
to finish,and attack,or if he wants to interrupt it,you can cancel it with 
just pressing 1 and yoshi will rotate his sword making shield that has GREAT
 range from up to down.You can cancel that attack too with b,B(this is useful
 if you hit enemy and he falls down,if you don`t cancel the Spinning Sword,
he can roll forward and hit you.I guess this is a glitch.It is useful too if
opponent wait for you to finish,and then attack.You can suprise him,hehe)
-His Sword Slice is very good for opponents on ground,it has GREAT recovery
 time,and with D/B you can transform it into Hopping Sword stance.
-His Copter Blade isn`t so useful as others,but it makes Yoshi fly,You can 
hit enemies with d,you can rotate by 180 degrees withg b,and you can wait 
for it to finish for maximum damage.
-His Sword sweep (FC,QCB+1)is OK unblockable,it hits sidestepping enemies,
but it has short range.
-His Sucide(d+1+4)is show move,if you are playing against beginners.You can
transfiorm in Sucide spin(b+1,1,1,1...).You can stab you and the enemy with
f,F+1+4,stab for the second time with f,F,or fool the opponent with N.
-His QCF+1 is VERY VERY GOOD unblockable,but no one uses it.It hits opponent
 two times,or just makes you closer to the enemy(scare them,yeah).
*****************************************************************************
He has the best u/f+2 uppercut!
*****************************************************************************
You can even combo in 4 Basic Uppercuts,because they`re so fast.Yoshi steps 
toward,and uppercuts enemy,dashing a bit.Like he`s using every atom of energy
 for that move to cause maximum damage to the...uh...I should stop here...
But I must say that you CAN`t be good Yoshi player if you don`t know how to
use his Basic uppercut and how to juggle with him.You must learn that.If you 
can beat Experts without using this move,then they are not experts.
*****************************************************************************
He has best Basic Punch in the game!
*****************************************************************************
Yup.His Basic punch (1) is the best,and fastest in the Tekken 3.It is great 
for poking opponent,interrupting their strings,combos,and then strike back to 
them.Also,Basic punch is great for extending a combo.You`ll see,when you start
 learning Yoshi`s combos & juggles.Basic punch can connect alot of stuff.
Definetively one of his most useful moves.
*****************************************************************************
He can Heal!
*****************************************************************************
Yup.He can heal.From D+3+4 or from SS+3+4.I reccomend D+3+4 because you can 
do alot other moves from this stance.
*****************************************************************************
Has good taunts(heh)
*****************************************************************************
Has good taunts.That`s it.He can taunt in many ways,and the biggest reason for
having that advantage is:HE HAS A DAMN SWORD!
See Taunting section for more info.
*****************************************************************************
He is unpredictable!
*****************************************************************************
This is maybe his best advantage.Let`s clear this.He is MASTER OF 
UNPREDICTABLE ATTACKS!You can sit down in Indian Style stance(is it a stance,
he is sitting,folks!),and this leaves you tons of options.You can heal with N,
you can hold D for messing with the enemy,you can teleport behind the enemy
(b_f),and peform a backthrow or string,you can fool them with 2,2,2,2...or 4.
Those False teleporters can really annoy your enemy.Yoshi rotates like he will 
teleport and then...HAHAHA!!!He strikes!Fooled you!
Whe you fly with him,you can slash the enemy with d,you can turn arond,or just 
wait to get behind the enemy.When you do his Sword Stab(b,b+1),you can 
transform it into Spinning Sword by pressing 1,and you can cancel the 
Spinning Sword too with b,b!Heh!While in Pogo Stick stance,you can rush with 
f,f,you can go in original stance to mess with the enemy,or you can jump with 
u/b_u_u/f.You can also do a kangaroo kick with 3+4.When you do a sucide,you 
can rush with b+1,1,1,1.When you do a turning sucide,you can cancel it yith N,
you can do a second stab with f,F if you missed the enemy first time.If you 
do a roundhouse with 3,you can press 4 for another attack!This can fool the 
enemy if he escaped the first attack.He is also unpredictable at juggling 
because you never know when he will send you into air.He can juggle with 
d/f+2,with Kangaroo kick(4~3),Bad breath(b+1+2,ANY),with FC,QCB+1,with 
FC,d/f+3,etc.
Yoshimitsu is real nightmare for his opponents because they never know what 
he will do next!

*****************************************************************************
So-So throws!
*****************************************************************************
Ok,Yoshi has some throws,but they will never be good as Nina`s or King`s,cool
 as Hwoarang`s or Eddy`s,but he can`t be good in all aspects of the game!
He doesn`t need multithrows to kill a opponent,but offcourse,that wouldn`t 
be bad thing at all.
*****************************************************************************
Sidestepping attacks
*****************************************************************************
He doesn`t have good sidestepping attacks.That`s for it.He will never be god 
at sidestepping as Top tier Sidesteppers,but it isn`t so big disadvantage.
*****************************************************************************
Reversals
*****************************************************************************
Yoshi doesn`t have much reversals.Only his b+1+3.Oh.But if you learn how to 
play with him,you will know how to escape situations when you`ll need 
reversals.
*****************************************************************************
Hardness!
*****************************************************************************
Yoshi is,in my opinion,one of hardest characters to play!If you play against 
Experts,you can always pick Gon,Eddy,Hwoarang,or Paul to easily win.Now I`m 
not talking that they are bad,but I learned to play with Paul effectively 
within 1 hour,and I still practice with Yoshi.You must use every his move,
and know how to juggle effectively,when to heal,when to strike,when to stab 
yourself(I`m not kidding)!You must practice,practice,practice.And when you 
think you are good with him,practice more.You can always think of new tactic 
to confuse your opponents,and easily win. 
*****************************************************************************
The Ending,and Intro
*****************************************************************************
The Yoshi(and dr.)ending just sucks.I just don`t get why programers did such 
a **** with the ending,good character should have good ending!I guess Yoshi`s
 ending tried to get funny,but it is like a short cartoon.Too bad.
Also,Yoshi isn`t so cool in Tekken 3 intro.HIS intro lasts for about 3-4 
seconds.

Ok,we`re gonna see all Yoshi`s moves trough microscope.
Here I will write EVERY SINGLE Yoshi attack,so you can know what is 
best,and  what is worst.There is a command for each move,move`s damage,
and my personal rating for that move.
I will even write the moves`names:-)
I`ll rate every move
with *s.Ratings are these:

*      - Worst Yoshi move,never use it
**     - Not very good Yoshi move,hardly ever used
***    - Average move,use it when you must
****   - Very good move,use it often.
*****  - Yoshi`s best move,use whenever you find a chance

Punch-Uppercut          Command:1,2         Rating:**      Damage:5,8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I hardly ever use this move,it is like 2 basic punches connected together.
You don`t really need it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Punch-Double uppercut  Command:1,2,1       Rating:****    Damage:5,8,6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is getting better.This is very good move,3 punches with really little 
times between punches.The best thing is you can take a string from it.
Yoshi`s best strings begin with Punch-Double Uppercut.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PK combo                Command:2,3             Rating:*       Damage:12,21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quick,but the buttons are cross-fingered,and damage is low.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PDK combo               Command:2,d+3           Rating:**      Damage:12,8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not so bad move,but you don`t really need it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Zig-zag                 Command:3,4             Rating:****    Damage:30,30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Great move if your opponent think you are finished with roundhouse.It just 
blows the «smart» opponent away,doing good damage.I use it when i miss the 
first kick,and it never fails.Good damage!!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kangaroo kick           Command:4~3             Rating:***     Damage:30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ok,it`s a juggle starter.Ok,in blows 30 health goodbye,but it is pretty slow 
and predictable,so anti-Yoshi players will easily do a low kick to interrupt 
you,then punish you.But this move isn`t complete useless.If you manage to 
hit the opponent it can be connected to some very powerful juggles.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Triple roundhouses     Command:4,4,4           Rating:*       Damage:20,20,21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It`s easy to pull off,but it`s Yoshi`s worst move.3rd kick will change the 
opponent`s axis,so you can do a string.But the bad thing is all kicks are 
high,so they can be easily blocked,ducked,or reversed.You should never use 
this move,but if you accidentaly do one roundhouse,you can FAST connect it 
into Knee Bash with f,F+4.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Backhand                Command:f+2             Rating:***     Damage:12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Smart move because it change enemy`s axis PRETTY FAST.Good when opponent is 
doing some slow moves.Punish them with backhand,then do a throw or a string.
Or Shark Attack!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ninja Blade Rush        Command:f,f+2           Rating:**      Damage:18
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bad move.Very bad move.When you finish it,you will be near opponent,so pray 
nothing happens to you.It has some recovery when blocked,and Masters will 
know how to use that advantage.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ninja Blade Slice       Command:f,f+2(CH)        Rating:****   Damage:18
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is Ninja Blade Rush indeed,but if it is a counterhit,it becomes a 
Ninja Blade Slice.If you are not sure will you do a counterhit,charge and 
strike!I just love this move.Yoshi cuts the enemy,go behind them,and then 
enemy falls.You can now do okizeme,or you can...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
= Sit                   Command:=+3+4             Rating:***    Damage:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Good thing is that you gain life,so you can gain about 10 health before 
opponent gets up.Bad thing is that you can`t teleport,or attack from this 
stance,so the only option is to get up.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Knee Bash               Command:f,F+4             Rating:******  Damage:20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is Yoshi`s best move!Maybe the best move in Tekken 3!It`s fast,has great
 recovery time,it is great as counterhit.It knocks down your opponent too!
This should be your first move when the match begins.Offcourse it can`t be 
reversed.Use it often,and you will surely win.Most people don`t realize 
the beauty of this move.When I tried it for the first time,I said»This 
should be good?Heh!This is most stupid move"!»But I now realize how much 
I was wrong.Be careful,though,it has little recovery time if blocked.
Also,it CAN be done when you`re running!
I know i put 6 stars,but this beauty deserves it...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sword Debate position     Command:SS+3+4           Rating:***    Damage:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In Sword Debate Position,Yoshi will turn his back.He can gain back his 
ealth,but if you stay in this position too long,he will start losing his 
health.If you press f or b,he will turn around and gain his health back.
He gains health proportional to the life he`s lost.I reccomend you to turn
around after 4 bounces,because Yoshi still didn`t lose any health,and he 
gains most health.Off course,use this move only when you`re far from the 
enemy.Also,in Tekken force,when there aren`t any opponents around,gain 
health with this move because it`s faster than Indian Style health gaining.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=Life siphon                 Command:=1+4         Rating:**   Damage:?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stupid move because you wil hardly ever catch your opponent.He MUST walk into
it.But if you do,Yoshi will get health taking it from his enemy.This move is 
pretty cool looking,and you can get the folks amazed if you connect it good.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=Give life                   Command:=f+1+4         Rating:*       Damage:?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heh!This is exatly same as Life Siphon,but the difference is that Yoshi give 
his health to the enemy!The only use is to taunt your opponent.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dive Bomb                Command:f,F+1+2          Rating:***    Damage:40
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to turn your back to the enemy,this is the best way to do it,and 
you can cause some damage too.If you master the art of Turned back,this move 
can be pretty useful.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
= Life Syphon       Command:=1+4           Rating:***     Damage:?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ok,this Life Syphon is much better than that Life Syphon from Sword Debate
Stance,and chances for catching the opponent are bigger,because he doesnÿt
need to walk into it.Cool-looking.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
= Reverse Life Syphon    Command:=F+1+4           Rating:**     Damage:?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Give your life to the enemy!HEH!Only for taunting.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shark Attack combo    Command:f,f+3+4,1+2,3+4  Rating:****  Damage:40,40,30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I use this move when I am losing,and want to easily defeat opponent,no matter 
how risky it is.This move can turn around the match in your win.
But,offcourse,Experts will know to interrupt it when they find a chance.
Use it when the opponent`s back is turned to you too!
BIG damage maker.Use wisely.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stone Fists     Command:b+1,1,1,1,1,1   Rating:****  Damage:10,10,10,10,10,10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This can be GREAT move if you knock the opponent in air,and want to damage 
him as much as possible.Every hit des 10 damage.But,if Yoshi does 6 spins,he
will make himself dizzy and he will fall.Oh man.So DON`T USE ALL SPINS!Use 
only first five,and you should do good.If you use this move in wrong 
situation,you can lose match in no time.It happened me hundred od times that
i wanted to do a Sword Stab(b,b+1)but i did Stone Backhands,and lost the
match.So,be careful.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Uppercut-Backhand         Command:d/f+1,2          Rating:***   Damage:15-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You launch opponent in air,then slap him.Good for changing opponent`s axis.
Too slow,though.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Door Knocker         Command:d/f+1<1<1<1     Rating:****  Damage:15,12,12,18
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cool move,if opponent doesn`t block your combo.You can very easily take a lot 
of his health in 2-3 seconds.It has very little recovery time if blockedUse 
it wisely.Last his hits low,so you can hit a fallen opponent too.One of my 
favourite moves.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Basic Uppercut            Command:d/f+2        Rating:*****  Damage:13
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This move rules.It is the best Basic uppercut in the game,because Yoshi steps 
forward a bit,and duck a bit too.It`s easily triggered,and it`s Yoshi`s best 
juggle starter.From this move you can do Stone Fists,Stone Backhands,or 
Spinning Low kicks,as a most easy juggles.But,when you practice more,and 
master the Basic Uppercut you wil be unstoppable.This move should be your 
first move to learn if you are a Yoshi-begginner.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Side kick              Command:d/f+4            Rating:****   Damage:19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is another good part of Yoshi`s arsenal.Side kick has the best range of 
all Yoshi moves(instead Sword Stab),it`s fast,has great recovery time,and it 
is very good against Mashers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stone Backhands  Command:d/b+2,2,2,2,2,2 Rating:**** Damage:10,10,12,12,14,15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This move is best for juggling opponent while he is in the air.DON`T use all 
spins,because Yoshi gets dizzy and falls after all spins.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Spinning Low kicks     Command:d/b+4,4,4,4,4,4  Rating:**   Damage:12,7,7,5,5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not good as Stone Fists or Stone Backhands,but good for confusing opponent,
and even better if connected after Stone Fists.Again,don`t use all spins,
because...you know.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
= Front kick              Command:=f+4             Rating:**     Damage:12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It`s a front kick allright.I never use it because I almost never use Spinning 
Low Kicks.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jumping Twist Foot           Command:[u/b_u_u/f]+4   Rating:*****  Damage:25
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GREAT move if you did some move that`s been blocked,and you want to quickly 
go back and hit your opponent.In 80% you will get out of opponent range with 
move,and be ready to strike.Good damage too.Use it often.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lunging Sweep                Command:FC,d/f+3        Rating:****   Damage:12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you love wake-up game,use this move.When you knock oponent to ground,this 
is very good move to damage him while he`s still on ground.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sit(Indian Style)            Command:d+3+4           Rating:*****  Damage:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yoshi`s classic.He sits on ground.He can`t be thrown,and any high attacks 
will miss him.The real beauty of this move is that is fully unpredictable,
and you can do tons of things in this stance.Use it often,but in right time.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
= Gain life              Command:=N       Rating:****  Damage:+5(each bounce)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yoshi gains life!With this move used correctly you can really drive your 
opponent crazy.Don`t use this move on computer too often,though.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
= Teleport                    Command:=[d_f]         Rating:****   Damage:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are close to opponent,Yoshi will teleport behind the enemy,and from 
there you can execute a string,or Back-Throw.However,if you`re not close to 
opponent,Yoshi will teleport to the same place,but with his back turned to 
the opponent.Use it wisely.It is very important part of Yoshi`s arsenal.

= Stone Backhands             Command:=2,2,2,2,2     Rating:***     
Damage:10,12,12,14,15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This move is same as regular Stone Bachands,but the difference is that 
Yoshi false teleport,and then strike.Good for annoying opponent and taunting.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
= Kangaroo Kick               Command:=4             Rating:***    Damage:30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Same as regular,but False teleporting,you know.Bad thing is this move is 
pretty slow,so Experts will see it`s coming,escape it,and punish you.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~         
= Stand up                    Command:=U             Rating:?      Damage:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yoshi stands up.What else to say?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Spinning Evade         Command:B+3+4       Rating:***    Damage:-8 each spin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cool move because Yoshi steps back and also sidesteps.The only bad thing is 
that you lose 8 health each spin.You can connect this move to 6 spins,but 
you lose big part of health.Risky,but has own purposes.If you see attack 
you can`t escape,you can use this move.One more thing:When you K.O.your 
opponent,you can`t heal,but you can`t take damage too.So,when you finish 
him off,good taunt or just a off-show move is Spinning Evade(all spins).

Poison Wind                 Command:u/f+3+4       Rating:****    Damage:10

Move is fast,does good damage,but it`s beauty is combos that you can do after 
this move.With combos correctly connected,it becomes pretty useful move.

Poison Rush                 Command:u/f+3+4,b+1     Rating:**    Damage:10,2

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is getting serious!GREAT if you manage to hit the opponent with the 
Sword Slice!For some people,this move can be hard.So I`ll tell you how to 
easily do it.Do the u/f+3+4,quickly press b+1,then 4,and then press D/B 
and quickly tap 1.Still hold D/B and you can now stop tapping 1.If you did 
good,Yoshi will be in his Delay Sword Position.

Great!If you finish this combo with Sword Slice,you will take DOZENS of 
opponent`s health!Damage depends of how many times Yoshi hopped.Does 100% 
damage when Yoshi`s sword start to smoke.

Sword Slice      Command:d/b+1                 Rating:*****    Damage:10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sword Slice is one of Yoshi`s best moves.It`s unblockable,it hits fallen 
opponents,it has great recovery time,and it does good damage forn such a 
fast move.Use it when you knock opponent on ground,or if you just want to
slice the opponent in half(ok,that doesn`t happen,but people with good 
imagination can imagine that).

When you do this move,Yoshi doesn`t finish his attack,he starts hoppong 
forward.The more hops you make,more damage you will do.Maximum damage is

Sword Impale(or Sword Stab) Command:b,b+1     Rating:*****    Damage:90
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most people don`t like this move,but I love it!It`s slow but it has GREAT 
range and it is GREAT for button mashers.Good against computer too.Poor guy
try to sidestep,but I always catch him.No,you can`t sidestep this move because 
it "lock on target".Use it when you need to,don`t use it when you know your 
opponent can interrupt it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This move rules.It does good damage,it is unpredictable,it has great range 
from up to down,and it is one of Yoshi`s best moves.Use it as a against 
rushing opponent or a masher.There are two bad things with this move,but 
they can be avoided.First:If you don`t hit your opponent,he can wait for 
you to finish,and then strike.Second:If you hit the enemy too fast,he can 
roll forward and counter you with rolling kick.I don`t know is it a glitch 
or not,but these two bad things can be avoided with...

Stupid move.I just hate it.It is maybe unblockable,and it even hits 
sidestepping enemies,but it`s range is very short,it is slow,and it does 
poor damage for short and slow move.

Yoshi fly!But this move is predictable,and your opponent will easily escape

Yoshi reverses and slashes.This move make Yoshi to fly down for a little

Standing Sucide          Command:d+1+4    Rating:*     Damage:60(-60 to you)

Yoshi`s cool move,but one of worst.It can only taunt the opponent.It CAN hit 
them,but only when you are turned back to them,and,if you manage to hit them,
you will get 60 damage too.

If you beat the crap of your opponent(if he has about 5% of health),and 
you`re on some party(whatever),use this move to 100% taunt the opponent,
and make the crowd amazed.It has minimum damage,just to finish the o
pponent off.It`s hard to avoid too.

be on your list of moves to learn,cause it`s classic,and it can make you 
win the match very easily!

Offense Tactics
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Yoshi is best at offense,so Pitbulls will be pleased with his arsenal of 
attacks.Good tactic is to start with Knee Bash(f,f+4),and Yoshi should knock
 the opponent down.Now you can jump back and do the Sword Stab(b,b+1),or 
Sword Slice(d/b+1)the opponent while he`s on ground,and then jump back.If you
 don`t knock opponent down with Knee Bash,do u/b+4 to quickly jump back and 
maybe hurt the opponent.From there you can do Roundhouse(3),and knock the 
opponent down.,if you don`t(he blocks or escapes),press 4 to do another 
suprise roundhouse that should knock the opponent.When you juggle the 
opponent with u/f+2,you can do two more Uppercuts(u/f+2)to get 3-hit combo,
or you can do Stone Fists(b+1,1,1...),but don`t finish it.Transform it into
 Spinning low kicks(D/B+4,4,4...)or Basic punch the opponent(1)and roundhouse
 him(4 or 3).You can also do Stone Backhands for good damage.If you don`t 
know what to do with opponent while he`s in BIG air(like the Kangaroo Kick 
juggle) ,roundhouse him(3).Move is fast,and does good damage.When in Pogo 
Stick stance,the best tactic is to jump on opponent.Rush on him when he`s 
on ground or just stand if (for example)Gon users do that damn 4,4,4,4,4...
If you play against people who doesn`t know to block(Mashers,Begginers),use 
Yoshi`s strings,his Sword Stab(b,b+1),his Door Knocker(D/F+1<1<1<1).Door 
Knocker is stupid if blocked,but it can be very useful if not blocked.Does 
great damage and it is best against Mashers.If you`re losing,use Yoshi`s 
Shark Attack(f,f+3+4,1+2,3+4).You can turn the match in your win.You can 
use it in beginning too,or when your opponent has his back turned to you
(ok,don`t do that against King...).To turn opponent`s back to you,you can 
do a Backhand(f+2) or Triple Roundhouses(4,4,4).I reccomend Backhand because 
it`s fast.From there do Shark Attack,string,back-throw,or Door Knocker.When 
you sit down,fool your opponent with Kangaroo Kick(4),which does 30 damage,
and also juggles.Then do a roundhouse(3 or 4),or Sword Slice(d/b+1).This is 
only a little part of Yoshi`s tactics,and you can make your own,using your 
favourite moves.So,be creative!

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
Defense Tactics
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Yoshi isn`t good in Defense like offense,but he has some really cool moves 
that should keep your opponent at distance.First and major thing:If your 
opponent rush on you,attack you,mash,or do something that would be hard to 
block,do Yoshi`s Spinning Sword(b,b+1~1)!Your opponents will almost always 
fall for that!If you hit the opponent with Spinning Sword early,and get him 
on ground,do Spin Cancel(b,b).That way Yoshi will stop spinning his sword,and
 that is good because laying opponent can roll forward,duck your Spinning 
Sword,and kick you,knocking you out.Do Spin Cancel also if your opponent 
wait for you to stop,and then rush.Spinning Evade(damn,almost every Yoshi`s 
move begins with»Spinning»)is good for getting back,but it`s risky because 
it hurts you.So,it`s on your choice. Also,use Yoshi`s Side Kick(d/f+4) 
often,it has long range,and it is fast,great for poking opponent.Knee Bash
(f,f+4)is great as counterhit,so use it when your opponent opens himself.
Jumping Twist Foot([u/b_u_u/f])is Yoshi`s best defense move,because it 
hits opponent,gets Yoshi back(out of opponent`s range),and it`s VERY VERY 
fast.Use it whenever you finish a move that gets you close to opponent.
I don`t reccomend sidestepping because Yoshi doesn`t have good sidestepping
attacks,and you can`t sidestep some characters(Eddy,for example)or Button
Mashers.Block often,and also use Yoshi`s Reversal(b+1+4),which can be an 
attacks too.Again,you can experiment with Yoshi`s moves,so be creative!

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
Ultimate Tactic
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

With this tactic you will easily beat lot of (computer)opponents easily.So,
here is it:

1.When the match begin,Do Knee Bash.
2.Sword Slice the fallen opponent,
3.Sword Stab him,
4.Mix the Knee Bash and Wood Chopper to kill him.

NOTE THAT YOU CAN`T DO THIS TACTIC WHEN YOU FIGHT AGAINST HUMANS,ONLY AGAINST
COMPUTER.

Another Ultimate(alternate)is:
1.Knee Bash,
2.Jump back,
3.Look at opponent:

IF HE`S RECOVERING FROM GROUND SLOWLY:

4.Sword Stab him!He`ll run in your Sword!!!???
5.Mix Knee Bash and Wood Chopper to finish him.

IF HE`S RECOVERING FROM GROUND FAST:

4.Knee him,then repeat the process.If that won`t help(he always quick    
  recovers),try to Knee him,Wood Chopper him,or juggle him.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
Survival Tactics
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

My personal record in Survival WAS 23(Yoshimitsu).Now it`s 48!Damn,Julia 
finished me!!!DAMN GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You can be good in Survival with Ultimate Tactic(see up).I use it,and when 
you master it,you can easily win a dozens of computer matches.

Advices:
I.Never heal in Survival.I tried to heal,but it all ended up in opponent 
kicking me and taking more of my health.

II.Don`t repeat the same move for too long,because your opponent will start
blocking it and punishing you.

III.Yoshi`s best moves for Survival are:

1.Jumping Twist Foot([u/b_u_u/f])--Use it for getting away from opponent,and 
to hit him,

2.Knee Bash(f,f+4)-----------------Use it almost always,

3.Wood Chopper(f,f+3,1)------------Use it often,when you think 
                                   it will hit your opponent,

4.Sword Stab(b,b+1)----------------Use it when opponent is getting up slowly,
                                   he will run into it,

5.Spinning Sword(b,b+1~1)----------It serves like shield,know to cancel 
                                   it when you must, 

6.Roundhouse(3)--------------------For quickly getting enemy down,
                                   use another roundhouse(4)if you need to.
IV.Don`t give up!Be patient!Sometimes you will kill 20 opponents,
but sometimes 2nd opponent will finish you!That happens to me too!

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
Time Attack Tactics
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

You need to be FAST here.On first stages do strings,Door Knocker(D/F+1<1<1<1),
and Shark Attack(f,f+3+4,1+2,3+4).In later stages,Use your Knee Bash.Use the 
Ultimate tactic,but don`t wait too long,like you would in Survival.Be Pitbull,
and crush your opponent!

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
Arcade Tactics
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

EASY: Do you really need a tactic?Use Door Knocker and you`re the winner!
NORMAL:Use Ultimate,or your own tactic here.
HARD:Use Ultimate Tactic,and block alot.Don`t leave yourself open for too 
long.Strings won`t help either.Be fast,and smart!

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
Tekken Ball tactics
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Well,Ultimate Tactic doesn`t help here,does it?Here we go:
In the beginning(if you have the ball),run into it,and it will go behind the 
opponent(in his area),and damage him.If the ball is in the centre,Shark Attack
 it(and the opponent)!The Shark Attack is the best Yoshi`s attack for Tekken 
Ball.Don`t use his sword,because you get nothing(try if you don`t believe me).
His best attacks for Tekken Ball are:

-Shark attack(I won`t write the command because I`m sick of it),
-His Jumping kicks([u/b_u_u/f]+[3_4]),

Not much,huh?Well,experiment.
When your opponent launches the ball at you,you can attack,but better thing 
to do is to do a Basic Punch(or throw).That makes the ball nicely jump a bit,
so you can attack it.You can do this with throws too.If you wanna mess with 
the enemy,neutral block(just stand still)!Only thing you will worry about is 
position of the ball(don`t let it fall in your area),so stand under it,and 
it will automatically jump to enemy.Don`t do this if the Guard Damage option
is on,though.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
Team Battle tactics
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Use your favourite characters,and get ready to rumble.Wait for other player 
to select his character,and you select the best character against opponent`s 
character.Your first character should be Yoshimitsu.If opponent selects any 
character which can be good for mashing(Eddy,Hwoarang,Lei...),pick Paul 
because you can counter them with Phoenix Smasher or do Tile Splitter to 
Phoenix Smasher.If he selects a female,you select a female too(if you know 
to play with females).If he selects any character which can easily juggle 
you,pick Dr. Bosconovitch or Gon.If he pick any strong character(Paul,Bryan,
Gun Jack,Kuma),pick Hwoarang and you will be too fast for them.Offcourse,you
 need to know these characters`moves,but that shouldn`t be too hard.If you 
don`t want to use this tactic,make your own.

+-+-+-+
Okizeme
+-+-+-+

Okizeme is pushing the opponent on the ground,and keeping him there!It is 
maybe cheap,but it is really effective if you know how to do it.Yoshi`s best 
okizeme is his Sword Slice(d/b+1).It is unblockable,it is fast,it hits fallen
opponents,it has pretty long range.What more you need?However,this move has 
one weakness:If opponent does a Quick Recovery,you will not hit him,and you`ll 
be in mid-side position,so he can easily string you or even throw you.
Another good okizeme is Poison Hurricane or Poison Wind.Fast as hell,and does 
good damage.Ofcourse,you should never underestimate the Pogo Stick Stance.
Unblockable,fast execution,and perfectly punishes opponents who love to lie 
on ground(like that damn Lei).Rush on him,or hop on him,let him take damage!
Spinning Sword is great because it will almost ALWAYS hit opponent who likes 
to roll forward,then kick you.BTW,make sure you cancel it early if opponent 
doesn`t catch in it.
Shark Attack maybe isn`t so great,but if you connect great,it will hit rsing 
opponent!Here`s how I use it:After I knock the opponent down,I wait for him 
to be in a middle of rising animation,then execute the Shark Attack.GREAT move 
because of his damage(if you connect it).
Spinning Low kicks are classic,so I don`t really need to explain them.
Sword Sweep is great okizeme,because it WILL hit opponents who roll to the 
background,and it has good damage.Only weakness:It is pretty slow.
One dngerous Okizeme move is Turning Sucide.You use it when opponent is 
standing up(not rolling!).It will do great damage if you connect it good.
BTW,it takes 100 health from you,so BE CAREFUL!

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
Avoiding Okizeme
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Ok,Okizeme is OK,but what if opponent wants to do it to you!You must know how 
to escape it or you`ll be dead soon.When you fall,best thing is Quick 
Recovery(~1,as soon you hit the ground),you will fastly get up,and roll a
bit,so opponent can`t hit you.You can also roll forwards and backwards,and 
even kick an enemy from there.Rolling forward is too risky so don`t use it 
often.Rolling backwards is OK thing to do,but beware,it is little slow.Good 
tactic to do after rolling backwards is Knee Bash or Spinnig Sword(if you do 
it fast!).Bad Breath is also good tactic after rolling backwards.Pogo Stick 
is GREAT if opponent loves to do low kicks(Like Gon`s 4,4,4...or Dr. 
Bosconovitch and Gun Jack`s Kossak Kicks).
You can also stand up after knocking down.It is the fastest Avoiding 
Okizeme tactic(if you don`t count Quick Recovery),but opponent will easily 
put you back on ground,so don`t use it TOO often,only when you must.

+-+-+-+-
Throwing
+-+-+-+-

Yoshi doesn`t have a plenty of throws,or Multi-link throws,but these are just 
fine.The best throws in general are side and Back-throws,and it is the same 
with Yoshi.Use his side and Back throws whenever you find a chance,they look 
cool,and do good damage.Yoshi has only one special throw:It is Rainbow Drop
(QCT+1+2).It is ok throw,but it is escepable,so don`t think you`ll surely 
slam the opponent if you grab him with this.The only unescepable throw is 
Back throw,but you can use other throws often if you play against begginers 
and Button Mashers.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+
Strings hints
+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Strings are VERY risky,but they look cool,and they are GREAT against 
Button Mashers!Yoshi has the easiest strings in Tekken 3,so LEARN THEM!
The first string I learned is Yoshi`s 1214441111 string.It is great,
it begins with 3 uppercuts,and it finishes with sword slices,which look 
really cool,and they are UNBLOCKABLES!
Ugh...I forgot to mention...the 4`s.They are Triple Roundhouses,so they 
can easily be ducked,reversed,countered,and interrupted.You will surely 
not have problems with Mashers,but when you play against Experts,don`t 
rely on strings too much.Another Yoshi good string is 1214222411.Again,
don`t rely on it too much.
Don`t even try other strings because THEY ARE STUPID,AND THEY ARE STUPID.
Another thing about other strings:
THEY ARE STUPID.

17-HIT STRING!
Ok,I practiced Yoshi at Practice Mode(obiovusly),and I did Yoshi`s 1214441111 
string,but I didn`t finished it!I did all attacks exept the last one
(the Sword Stab),and I began the string again.Strangely,combo meter raised,
so I did 17-hit string,with 130 damage!Ok,here it goes:
First do 1,2,1,4,4,4,1,1,and skip the last attack.The best thing to do this 
is to fastly press 1,2,1,then press 4 until Yoshi is finished with second 
kick,then press 1 until he finishes his second sword slice.Then DON`T PRESS 
ANYTHING ELSE!When Yoshi stops attacking(be sure he DIDN`T attack with Sword 
Stab),start the string again!So,again press 1,2,1,4,4,4,1,1,and you don`t need 
to press anything else,because opponent will be too far away from you before 
you manage to finish the string.This maybe only works in Practice,
but it is cool!BTW,this will maybe not work on your first try.

This is the hardest challenge for you and here you must put all your skills 
to ultimate test(unless there are no experts in your environment).There are 
tactics for each character and for two types of player-EXPERT/MASTER and 
MASHER.So,let`s go:
-----------
LING XIAOYU
-----------
EXPERT
Watch out for her Phoenix Stance.Masters use it often.Also,she can be a threat 
when she turns her back,because she can fastly juggle and combo you.
She is fast,so poke with d/f+4 when you need to.Watch out for her strings and 
know when to interrupt them.
MASHER
Mashers will do that u/f+4 often,and that`s it.Ling isn`t good character for 
mashers,so they will not use her often.
----------
YOSHIMITSU
----------
EXPERT
This is very hard battle if he knows about Yoshi like you.Yoshi is 
unpredictable and fast,so look for his opening.If he does something wrong,
counter with Knee Bash.If he tries to do something with sword,be ready to 
escape it.Block often.All of Yoshi`s strings have high roundhouse(4th hit),
so duck,and counter.Don`t let him finish his string because all of Yoshi`s 
strings end with unblockables.Try to reverse his roundhouses.Don`t let him 
heal himself.If he goes to Pogo Stick,knock him down with roundhouse.
If you are far from him,and he starts to heal,you heal too!Use Spinning 
Sword when he rush on you.NEVER let him to Sword Stab you,because he will 
probably win the match.Knee,Wood Chopper,and Jumping Twist Foot are your 
best friends here.
MASHER
Mashers love to do Triple Roundhouses,so duck it,or reverse it.Yoshi also 
isn`t a good character for mashers(altough he may look cheap because he has 
sword),so they won`t use him too often.
------------------------
EDDY GORDO/TIGER JACKSON
------------------------
EXPERT
Eddy Experts don`t exist on Earth,so if you meet one,it`s an alien.
MASHER
He can be hard,because hit range always changes.Do strings,Knee Bash,and 
unblockables.You can also uppercut him and juggle him to death.Mashers 
usually don`t know to block,so strike when they open themselves!Heh...you 
may want to see their faces when you kill them with Sword Stab...
--------
HWOARANG
--------
EXPERT
Hwoarang loves to kick,so block,and wait for open spot.then Knee him,or do 
Shark Attack,which can be VERY useful against Hwoarang users.Don`t let him 
to do the Flamingo stance.
MASHER
Usually all they know is pushing 3,3,3,3...and maybe f,f+4 move,so block,
and when you see them opened,strike!Do Spinning Sword on them.Use Yoshi`s 
strings too.
------------
PAUL PHOENIX
------------
EXPERT
Paul is one of worst opponents for Yoshi.He can do Tile Splitter To Phoenix 
Smasher till your death.His Elbow uppercut is a bit slow,so ESCAPE IT,or you 
will be an «ace in the hole».Watch out for his Falling Leaf Combo too,because 
it`s fast and strong.Paul users also do his u/f+3,4,which can juggle you too.
But Paul`s most dangerous move is Phoenix Smasher.It does 50 damage and it`s 
great as counterhit.Don`t be close to him,keep a distance.You should beat 
him using Yoshi`s long range moves.Yoshi`s d/f+4 helps here.Experiment.When 
you find good tactic,use it wisely.Blocking is great thing to do because 
Paul`s only unblockable,the Super Death Fist is very slow,so you will know 
when it`s coming.
MASHER
They do Tile Splitter to Phoenix Smasher often.so BLOCK IT!!Use your sword 
and poke them to death.Juggle them so they can`t catch you in their powerful 
attacks.
---
GON
---
EXPERT 
Use your Pogo Stick and you should beat him in no time.Gon isn`t hard at all,
you just need to know what to do!Sword Slice and Spinning Low kicks are also 
good for him.Don`t let him fart!His flame attack is pretty slow,so you will 
easily escape it.Poke with FC,d/f+4.
MASHER
They will fart and do 4,4,4,4....Some of them will flame as well.Just go in 
Pogo Stick stance and jump on him.You will easily beat him.
----------
LEI WULONG
----------
EXPERT
He can be really hard because of his stances.If you don`t block,he will defeat 
you real quick.When he lie down,don`t rush to him.Sit and heal.When he comes 
to you,teleport and strike.Knock him out of his stances.Use your knee and 
Wood Chopper alot.
MASHER
He will lie down and attack,and repeat that all the time.Use Pogo Stick when 
he lies down,and your sword should be handy here.Don`t forget your strings.
---------------
DR.BOSCONOVITCH
---------------
EXPERT
Pogo Stick can help,but it won`t be so easy like Gon.Use Spinning Low Kicks,
Sword Slice,and Sword Sweep.Dr. can be very tricky sometimes,because,like 
Eddy,his moves are unpredictable.Do Poison Wind and Double Front Slice against 
him.
MASHER
Use Pogo Stick.
----------
FOREST LAW
----------
EXPERT
Damn,he is fast as hell!He juggles you with almost every move!Use Spinning 
Sword!.Try to uppercut him,because then you can Do Shark Attack,which should 
do big damage to him.He is tricky,don`t let him juggle you,or combo you.Block!
MASHER
They usually do u/f+4 twice,or d+3+4 to kill you.Roundhouse them,and use your 
sword.Law masher isn`t hard as Law Expert.
----
KING
----
EXPERT
DON`T LET KING GRAB YOU!Most people say»learn breakouts!»,but you can`t always 
know which throw he will execute!Stay at distance.He can Ali Kick you to 
death.Never go near him when he`s got his back turned to you!He can do a 
very fast unblockable from there!Poke,and uppercut!Use your knee!
MASHER
Mashers don`t know multithrows,but they wil either do b+4,or 1+2,1+2.They 
usualy know Ali Kicks too.Don`t underestimate King Mashers,because King is 
very cheap character,and that means Mashers can beat Experts with him!
---------------
GUN JACK/JACK-2
---------------
EXPERT
Gun Jack has some very powerful moves,and he can fastly defeat you if he 
juggle you.So,don`t let him juggle you!His bad thing is his slowness,so 
use that advyntage.Attack,go back,attack,go back,and so.Don`t repeat the 
same attack because you will be predictable.Try to block his attacks,and 
don`t go near him.Stay at distance,and be fast.
MASHER
Mashers do Jack`s 1,1,1,and maybe his d/b+3,4,3,4,3,4.They usually fly,so 
escape that unblockable,and punish them for such a stupid move.You can use 
the Sword Stab too,because Gun Jack is very slow.
-------
MOKUJIN
-------
EXPERT
You and your opponent first must to figure out which character is Mokujin 
imitating.When you reckonize him use tactics for the character which Mokujin 
is imitating.You can reckonize him by his taunt before match,by his stance,
or by his moves.If he has a sword,beware,because,he is YOU!
MASHER
Mashers usually don`t know that Mokujin is imitating other characters,so they 
will mash with every character they get.Figure out their character,and strike!
You will easily beat them.The only problem is if Masher gets Eddy.
----------------
HEIHACHI MISHIMA
----------------
EXPERT
The first thing he will do is to juggle you,so block!Heihachi can be very 
powerful in a hands of a master,so watch out for his moves.Try to juggle him,
because he can`t do anything in the air.Also,use fast moves against him.He 
can`t reverse your knee,so use it often.
MASHER
Mishima isn`t for mashers,but they CAN repeat the same move if they find out 
it`s good.Block/reverse it,and attack.
----------
JIN KAZAMA 
----------
EXPERT
Uhhh.This can be one of toughest battles,because Jin is one of best characters 
in Tekken 3,if used correctly.Don`t let him to rush on you,use Yoshi`s best 
moves.Be fast.Watch out for his Electric Wind God Fist,and don`t rush when he 
crouches,because he can juggle you with WS+2,and finish you fastly.He`s one of 
fastest male fighters in Tekken 3,so expect everything from him.
MASHER
They will always do his u/f+4,4,4,4...Block high,low,low,and high to stop 
them,the rush back.
-------------
NINA WILLIAMS
-------------
EXPERT
Some people say that she`s best character in Tekken 3.I don`t agree with that,
but she can be pretty hard if Nina player knows what to do in a battle with 
you.DON`T LET HER GRAB YOU!She has multithrows like King!Also,her strings are 
unpredictable,and very fast!She is maybe the fastest character in Tekken 3!
Be very careful,and don`t use move that have slow recovery.If you do 
something wrong and get close to her,use Roundhouse or Jumping Twist Foot.
MASHER
Masher don`t use Nina often.If they do,thesy shouldn`t be such a big problem.
Just block and counter.
-----------
JULIA CHANG
-----------
EXPERT
She is,in my opinion,the hardest character to play against,if you`re 
Yoshimitsu.If used correctly,Julia can juggle you to death,or do a really 
bad Wake-up Game.Wake-up Game is to make your opponent stay on the ground.
She can do this very good.Also,she has good combos,so watch out.I recommend 
Yoshi`s unblockables,and fast attack like Knee,Basic punch,or Jumping Twist 
Foot.If you manage to uppercut her,try to keep her in air,and do maximum 
damage,because she is very dangerous when she is standing.Try to poke her 
if you can.
MASHER
Mashers NEVER use Julia because she is hardest character to master.If the 
pick her,they will do nothing dangerous,because all of Julia`s useful moves 
are hard to execute.
----------
BRYAN FURY
----------
EXPERT
Bryan is FAST,and he has FAST unblockables.Don`t let him combo you,because he 
can mix a great combos in no time.Be careful if he sidesteps,because he has 
good sidestepping attacks too.
MASHER
They will usually do his f,f+2,it`s fast,and it grounds you.Try to block it,
and the punish them.
----
OGRE
----
EXPERT
He shouldn`t be much hard,just block,rush,block,and rush.Beware of his 
unblockables,and don`t let him grab you.
MASHER
Block,counter,and so.
---------
TRUE OGRE
---------
EXPERT
Same as original Ogre,but this one can fire.No problem,you`ll know when it`s 
coming,so you can easily escape it.Again,don`t let him throw you!
MASHER
They do d+3,3,3,and they often do 1+2(fire).It`s easy to escape it,and then.
..Hasta La Vista Baby!
-------------
ANNA WILLIAMS
-------------
EXPERT
She fights a lot like her sister Nina,and her best weapons are strings.
Don`t let her to string you!
MASHER
Easy as pie.Knee her,and then have a sword party!
----------
PANDA/KUMA
----------
EXPERT
Panda users often do multiple uppercuts,so BEWARE!Also,don`t let him/her 
grab you because he/she has very powerful throws.Don`t underestimate 
Kuma/Panda,and be deadly!
MASHER
Use your knee,and strings.You should beat them in no time.

And one more thing:NEVER GIVE UP!THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE TO WIN!!!

I didn`t steal this combo list,I made it myself.You may put it on your FAQ,
but giving me the credit for it.
In lot of combos,you need to Basic Punch the enemy(1).You usually must to 
hold forward when pressing 1,because that way Yoshi walks near enemy,and 
he hits him.If you don`t hold forward,you will just punch the air.Also,when 
doing Basic Punch,you need to be good at timing.Wait for opponent to fall 
long enough so you can hit him with Basic Punch.If you`re not good at timing,
you may hit the opponent with the first attack,but you will be unable to 
continue the combo,because you will miss him.PRACTICE!I recommend the Basic 
Uppercut as a juggle starter because it`s just the best.Also,use left 
punch(1)VERY VERY wisely,because it can be connected in very long combos.
Combo enders are Sword Slice(d/b+1),Side Kick(d/f+4),and Knee Bash(f,f+4).
You can exted the combo with Basic Punch(1),and Stone Backhands(b+1).
These are regular extenders,but there are more.
One more thing:Learn combos that are effective,and easy to memorize,so you
will not forget them.Of course,don`t use stupid combos just because they 
are easy to learn.

-Turning Sucide(But cancel it!)                      -B to B
*****************************************************************************
Close to enemy
*****************************************************************************
Yoshi is real master in close range,so use that advantage wisely!If you can 
hit opponent with Front kick,Knee Bash,or Sword Slice,you`re close to enemy.
From here,the best thing to do is:
- Knee Bash(definetively the best move to do from here),
- Front Kick
- Wood Chopper,
- Strings,
- Juggles,
- Combos,
- Poison Hurricane,
- Basic Punch(for poking)
- Also,you can try throws,but don`t do it so often.
- Experiment with other moves too.
Use this position wisely,you can easily win the match if you know what to do 
in it.
*****************************************************************************
Close-Far
*****************************************************************************
This is the position from where you can run into opponent and tackle him.
Moves from here are:
- Sword Stab(or transform it into Spinning Sword),
- Pogo Stick(especially for Gon and Doctor Bosconovitch),
- Knee Bash,
- Door Knocker.
- Healing!
*****************************************************************************
Far away
*****************************************************************************
If you run from this position,you`ll Shoulder Ram the enemy.About 3-4 
character lenghts away from opponent.
Yoshi is not SO good here,but,you have some moves to do:
- Healing,then teleporting!
- Shark Attack,
- Bad Breath Stance,
- Spinning Sword,
- Double Front Slice,
- Pogo Stick,
- Helicopter Leap.
*****************************************************************************
Side
*****************************************************************************
Simply,side.You can go there by side-stepping or doing some moves that 
change opponent`s axis(like Triple Roundhouses).From here,you can:
- Execute a side throw!
- Strings,
- Juggles,
- Poison Hurricane,
- Shark Attack.
*****************************************************************************
Behind the enemy
*****************************************************************************
Wow.It is hella`hard to go here,but if you do,you can cause major damage to 
enemy.Best moves from here are:
- Back-throw!It can`t be escaped,and it does 70 damage!
- Strings!Opponent can`t block them!
- Shark Attack!
- Poison Hurricane(with Sword Slice!),
*****************************************************************************
Back to back(B to B)
*****************************************************************************
Yeah,you turned your back to the enemy.From here,you can:
-Do a Backand,and then juggle the opponent
-Do the Roundhouse,
-Do Standing Sucide(really!),but be careful.


BTW,experiment,and use your own moves if you want.These moves are tested and 
they work good.Firstly use them,then add some your own if you want.

Taunting is part of Tekken 3 gameplay,and it reminds you that this is only a 
videogame.Taunting can also get people around you in mood,and make atmosphere
around.Yoshi is a real master of taunting.He can taunt in many ways.Yoshi`s 
easiest taunt is his Standing Sucide(d+1+4).He stabs himself in chest.When 
you play against total beginers,you can use this taunt,and even rush on enemy 
with b+1,1,1...Be careful,you lose 1/2 of your health that way,so,if you play 
against experts,they will EAT YOU IN NO TIME.Yoshi can taunt with his Indian 
Style stance(d+3+4).You can from there teleport(f or b),fool the opponent 
with false teleporters and do pretty good damage,and offcourse,good laugh.
Good taunt is to watch them calmly,with simply holding down.Yoshi`s maybe 
best taunt is Turning Sucide(f,F+1+4).Yoshi stabs himself,and the enemy!
Great damage!You can stab you second time with f,F,but you`re dead if you do 
that.You can scare the enemies with just not holding F!Yoshi positions himself 
like he will do Turning Sucide,but nothing happens!HA!Yoshi can also taunt 
with his Pogo Stick stance(he really looks weird in that stance),and the 
coolest thing is letting enemies to try to low attack you!Also,Stone Fists,
Stone Backands,and Spinning Low Kicks can taunt if you let Yoshi get dizzy 
and fall.You can taunt with his Bad Breath Stance too!Do the stance,cancel 
it,do it again,cancel it,do it again,but now sneeze on opponent!Heh!Also,
you can taunt with his Spinning Evade(b+3+4 - up to 6x),because Yoshi loses 
health.In Sword Debate Stance,you can do Life Siphon to get health from 
enemy,but you can do Reverse Life Siphon,which give YOUR health to the enemy
!Cool!His Helicopter Leap CAN taunt(I`m flying!Yes I am!!!),because you 
look cool while doing it.Also,when(if?)you kill your opponent,do good 
looking moves like Sucides,Spinning Evade or something.That should be all,
but if this is too little to you,then you need other game,not Tekken,because
 Tekken 3 is 95% fighting and 4.5% taunting.The other 0.5% is Options:-)

Ok,some things to say when playing:

---------------------------
After doing Standing Sucide    
---------------------------
-Oh,Holy Samurai leader!I must die because this is too easy for me!Receive 
my sacrifice!
-I must die because I can`t kill him/her!I feel sorry for him/her!
---------------------
...Spinning Sucide...
---------------------
-Oh,this is better than Tequila!Yeahhh!!!
-/Singing/
-------------------------------------------------
While doing any move that makes Yoshi dizzy
-------------------------------------------------
-Uh...where did you go?Not fair!
-Ugh...no fair!One against five!
-/talking like you`re drunk/
-------------------
When you`re healing    
-------------------    	
-Yesss....AAHHHH!!!!OHHHH!!!THIS TURNS ME ON!!!!!
-------------------
While Bad Breathing  
-------------------     
-Ugh...sorry,I should stay in bed today...
-ARGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-------------------------------
When you do Reverse Life Siphon
-------------------------------
-There,that should extend your life a bit...some seconds.
-Hey!That`s mine!!
-You`ll need that!
---------------------------------------
If you manage to connect Turning Sucide
---------------------------------------
-So I must stab us both to end this battle?
-That`s not fair!I shouldn`t hit you,only myself!
---------------------------------
While hitting with any sword move
---------------------------------
-Damn!You`re polluting my sword!
-Oh...my own sword now stinks!Ugh!!!I must die!!!(now you should do Standing 
Sucide)
-Let`s see what you ate for breakfast!Ooh,you`re surely NOT on a diet!
-------------
When you lose
-------------
-Can I start playing now?
-I let you win.
-Ok,now for real!
------------
When you win
------------
-I was just warming up!
-WHAT!YOU ARE ALREADY DEAD?!!!!
-/Laughing like a maniac/:BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHOHOHO!!!!
-Sorry...I forgot to let you win.
-Oops.
-----------------------------------------------
Times when you should laugh like a crazy maniac
-----------------------------------------------
-When you just don`t let opponent to get up (HAHAHAHA!!!)
-If you finish a string (HAHAHAHA!STUPID!!)
-If you hit them with Sword Stab (HAH...WHAT?I HIT YOU WITH THIS???HAHAHAHA!)
-If you juggle him to death (again...MWGHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!)
-If you perfect him (This is my favourite!He really deserves to be taunted)
-If you finish him with Basic Punch (HEH!)
-Whenever you think you should laugh..It`s good,it`s fun,and it extends life,
dammit!

Yoshi has alot of cool moves,and tha major reason is:HE HAS A SWORD!!!He can 
slice the opponent,he can stand on it,fly with it,stab himself with it,stab 
himself AND the enemy with it,do freaky moves with it!Enough!NO!He has more 
cool things,but let`s begin.

Try his sword moves!Let`s see them:

-d/b+2 – Sword Slice!Good looking,can hit opponents on ground,great for 
 annoying the enemy,or finishing a combo with it.You can do this move with 
 f,f+3,1 too.
-f,f+2(CH) – His Ninja Blace Slice is really GREAT!Yoshi slices the 
 opponent`s stomach with his sword,goes behind him while opponent bleeds and 
 then slowly falls.You can even heal after this move with d+3+4!BTW,it must 
 be counterhit,so when opponent is far from you,charge,then strike with this 
 beauty!Definetily a move in Yoshi`s Top 5 coolest moves.
-QCF+1 – Again,one of his coolest moves,Yoshi does a double rolling jump,and 
 slashes the opponent with his sword TWICE.
- d+1+4 – Ok,Yoshi does a Harakiri(translation:Ritual Samurai sucide which is 
 done by stabing yourself in the stomach),you  lose tons of health,but it is 
 good for taunting apsolute begginers(when you know you`ll win).
-f,F+1+4 – Yeah baby!Turning Sucide is GREAT LOOKING but painful to YOU...
 and to opponent...IF YOU HIT HIM.Good for using after Basic Uppercut,
 80% you`ll hit enemy with it(if he doesn`t roll from ground).You can press 
 f,F to stab yourself for the second time,but you can`t taunt after that move 
 because you`re...
 dead.
-FC,d,d/b,b+1 – Stupid move.Slow,short-ranged.Only advantage is that he can 
 hit side-stepping enemies.But is at least looks cool!
-u/f+1+2 – You fly!Cool or what?
-u+1+2 – You stand on sword!HA!Good laugh with this move.Hopping while in 
 this stance is hillarious.Also,all low attacks will be reversed,because 
 opponents hit sword,not you!Also,you can`t be thrown!
- b,b+1 – If you hit opponent with THIS,you won the match.Hell slow but 
 painful,damaging,and cool enough to get to this list.But really cool 
 extension to this move is when you press b,b+1,1 instead b,b+1!Yoshi spins 
 his sword and you`ll surely hit the rushing enemy.I found this move very 
 very,I SAID VERY useful for Button Mashers.
 Also,when (if?) you finish your opponent,cool thing to do is to execute 
 sucide.It doesn`t do any damage to you because match is just ended.You can 
 try the Spinning Evade(b+3+4 up to 6x)too.

That`s for this sword moves,now for «regular» cool moves:

-d+3+4 – Sit down.So what.I can do that too.But good thing is you can 
 HEAL!!!!GREAT for annoying Mashers,because you calmly heal while they dance 
 Boogie-Woogie with Eddy.
-Clonimitsu!Great!Yoshi splits in two and slash`n smash the enemy by 
 cooperating with his clone.GREAT!
-Dizzy moves!b+1,1,1...or d/b+2,2,2... or d/b+3,3,3...juts try it.Cool because 
 Yoshi acts drunk after 6 spins.Good for juggles too.
-b+1+4 – Why reverse with your limb when you can do it with your sword?
-SS+3+4 - Sword Debate!GREAT!Coolest moves from this stance are 1+4,and 
 F+1+4.With 1+4 you turn around,take opponent`s    head,and take his health!
 Very cool!F+1+4 is tha same,but now you give YOUR health to the enemy!HA!
-u/f+3+4,b+1,4,DB – Just cool.Try it.Not for taunting,but good-looking. 
-Juggles – Just juggle yor opponent,and watch him react.
-Strings!His coolest strings are 1,2,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1, and 
 1,2,1,4,2,2,2,4,1,1.They end in beautiful unblockables too.Easy to learn,
 and good to watch.Also,painful to take it:-)
-f,f+3+4,1+2,3+4 – The Shark Attack.Use when opponent leaves himself open.
 They will be more than suprised when they realize you killed him with 
 Shark attack,and they almost had you dead:-)))

NINJA BLADE SLICE GLITCH!!!

One really cool thing with Yoshi:When you do Ninja Blade Slice(f,f+2,CH),
Yoshi will go trough the opponent,and be behind them.So,if you do Ninja Blade 
Slice while BEHIND the opponent,you`ll go trough them,but you will get back 
where you have been!It is surely a glitch,but it is cool as hell!The best 
thing to do this is if you have Yoshi V.S. Yoshi match.Opponent will think he 
is the other Yoshi!Great!

helps the poor and disadvantaged. Yoshimitsu visited Boskonovitch when he
learned of the many martial artist disappearances. The "Yo-man" was surprised
to find Boskonovitch suffering from a mysterious pathological organism. It's
believed to have been contracted during lab experiments while making the Cold
Sleep machine. Like some weird sci-fi story, Boskonovich claims he needs
blood from the God of Fighting to complete his research and bring his
daughter back to life. Indebted to Boskonovitch for saving his life,
Yoshimitsu enters the tournament to help an old friend.
