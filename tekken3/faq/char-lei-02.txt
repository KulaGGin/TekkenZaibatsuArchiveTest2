-MG-'s TEKKEN 3 LEI WULONG FAQ
------------------------------

Revision 4.1
------------

*NOTE* This is designed to be viewed in a monospace font, otherwise it's
going to look really stoopid ... you have been warned =)



Revision history:
-----------------

Revision 1: written for the 60% test version, many Tekken 2 moves
missing.

Revision 2: written for the 95% test version, corrected all moves
that changed since the 60%, added all Tekken 2 moves, added new
moves added since the 60% version, added and changed strategy
sections, reorganised the FAQ into sections.

Revision 3: written for the 100% version, corrected animal stance
names (tiger->dragon, mantis->panther, ???->tiger), added moves for
trip & elbow throw, guard melting punches from panther stance,
confirmed usage for drunken surprise exchange, added other changes
since 95% version (changes to floating behaviour of some moves,
renamed 'hopping low kick' from snake stance for new animation, also
snake stance change possible during rave spin performed with back
turned), added more strategy stuff (plus Lei Vs Lei guide), and info
on auto-blocking in animal stances.

Revision 4: totally reformatted, reorganized, REWRITTEN, loads of
corrections (oops!), hit levels for all moves, strategy for EVERY
single move, more juggles, more strategy, just LOADS more!

Revision 4.1: added damage levels.  Some are missing for basic moves, such as
basic rising kicks, WS+4, u/f+4 liftkick, etc.  Also corrected some hit
levels: PNS:2~1 hits lh.  CRS:3,4,2,3 hits mlmM.

Still to come: more juggles (and more juggle confirmations), plus Vs guide
for Lei Vs the time-release characters.

*XX      - stance/position change only when hit is blocked
	   e.g. -,*BK means 2nd hit recovers to BK position if
	   it's blocked

XX:      - start from stance/position XX.
	   e.g. stabbing punches from snake stance could be listed
	   as SNS:2,2,2



----------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Basic move list:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The moves are listed twice, the first list gives a name/description for each
move, the second list replaces this with a column giving the damage levels.



In the first list, moves are given in the following format:

command                 height  pos/stance      description


The command is the joystick/button sequence required for the move.
The height is the hit position of each attack.
The position/stance is the position that you are left in after
performing each hit of the combo.


Position/stance names:

BK   - Back-turned position (standing with back to opponent)
PLD  - Play Dead (on ground, face up, head towards opponent)
SLD  - Slide (on ground, face down, head towards opponent)
FCD  - Face Down (on ground, face down, head away from opponent)
KND  - Knockdown (on ground, face up, head away from opponent)
CRS  - Crane Stance
TGS  - Tiger Stance
PNS  - Panther Stance
DRG  - Dragon Stance
DRS  - Drunken Stance
SNS  - Snake Stance
SQB  - Sleeping Queen of Birds stance



e.g.
4~4,3,3                 LLm     KND,KND,FCD     rolling kicks

This is interpreted as follows:
command: 4~4,3,3: tap right kick twice quickly, then left kick twice
height: 1st 2 hits are low (& hit a downed opponent), 3rd hit is mid
position/stance: stop after 1st or 2nd hit for KND position, stop
after 3rd hit for FCD position.

If the pos/stance is listed as '-' it means a regular forward-facing
stance.


In the second list, moves are given in the following format:

command                 height  pos/stance      damage

The damage column gives the basic damage level for each hit in the combo.
These damage levels will probably be affected by other factors such as
whether the hit is a major counter, minor counter, or is used in a float.
For example, f,N,4,1,2,3 does a total or about 50% if the first hit is a MC,
but does barely half that in a juggle.

Special info on throws & reversals:

* All 1+3 or 2+4 throws (forward, back or side) can be performed from
the BK position.  A missed throw returns you to BK.

* The DRG:1 command only gives the neck-shaker if the opponent is
facing Lei, it can give the b-throw, rs-throw or ls-throw in other
circumstances.

* The life gain drink during the neck shaker throw will cause the
throw to do only half the normal damage - the other half is added to
Lei's lifebar.

* The low combo break does no damage, and gives Lei a 26 frame
advantage.

* The mid/high punch reversal does no damage, and leaves Lei facing his
opponent's side.  The advantage time (if any) is currently unknown.

(2) Strategy for all moves
----------------------------------------------------------------------



----------------------------------------------------------------------
    (i)   special attacks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------
[Normal forward-facing stance]
------------------------------

1+2: The single turning punch is useful for faking one of the two-hit
variations to get close to your opponent with your back turned, where you can
surprise them with a rave spin, low backfist juggle, or throw attempt, all of
which will work against an opponent who stands in a mid/high block.

1+2~1: The 2 turning punches both hit high (making them fairly risky), and
have no real advantage over the uppercut variant, but can be useful in a
juggle.

1+2~2: Turning punch and back uppercut is a very useful attack, the uppercut
can start a juggle and is guaranteed(?) if the first hit MC's.  Be careful
with over-using this because the first hit is high and can leave you wide
open to counters (especially against Jin players who use a lot of crouch
dashing attacks).

3,3: A fairly under-used combo, this is always a great attack option against
a lot of Xiaoyu, Eddy and Lei players who mix up mid attacks with very low
stances.  For example, against a Lei player who mixes up punch rushes and
play-dead techniques, if you know he's going to do one of these attacks, go
for 3,3 and you should get him with the 1st hit if he punch rushes, or the
2nd hit if he plays dead, for some fairly high damage either way.

3~4,[U#],[D]: The jumping crescents are fairly risky (high execution time, so
it's easily countered), but have the advantage that they have a long
block-stun time, so if they are blocked, you are left at an advantage with
your back turned.  From here, your opponent has to guess your next move, you
can go for a back uppercut juggle, a throw, rave spin, or low backfist
juggle.  Use the falldown (pull D during the combo) to hit a downed opponent
for some big damage.

4~3: The cartwheel kick has a long range, it's useful against turtling
opponents who stay out of your way, and leaves a good choice of followup
attacks from the facedown position.

4~4,3,3: The rolling kicks are quite irritating (for your opponent), and are
a good way to finish off a nearly-dead opponent, as you always stand a good
chance of landing the first one or two hits, although the damage is minimal.
The last hit does very good damage, so this makes a useful juggle ender, and
it's often possible to connect the whole thing on a back-rolling opponent.

F+4,2,1,2,3_(4,[SS]): A fairly risky combo as the 1st hit is high and fairly
slow.  Only follow through to the crane stance if you are sure that your
opponent is slow to respond to stance changes.  Good against
scrubs/intermediates, but risky against experts.

f,N,1,2,1,2,3_4: The punch rush, staple diet of most Lei players. New Lei
players need to get into this combo first, it's main advantages are its good
damage potential if you counter with it, a guessing game at the end (low kick
or midkick), and stance changing possible at any point during the combo.

f,N,2,1,2,1: The guard melting punches are good for surprising an opponent,
but only work if they are blocking high.  The punches are easily reversed, so
don't use them against players who know how to take advantage of them.  Like
the jumping crescents, this combo (if the whole thing is blocked) will leave
you at an advantage with your back turned, so follow up with your favourite
back-turn technique.  Note that the 3rd punch floats if it connects
(which only happens if your opponent tries to counter or dash out of
range after the 2nd punch is blocked).

f,N 3,4_(d+4): The high crescent is a fairly risky attack (fairly slow and
hits high), but does good damage if it counters.  If it's blocked, you can
follow up with either a mid or low kick, your opponent has to guess which.
The main advantage of this combo is that it's very rarely used, so you can
often perform this from way outside hit range and surprise your opponent with
the low kick as they run in to counter you.

f,N,4,1,2,3,4_(d+4): Lei's rush combo is a very useful attack.  If you MC
with the first hit (you can tell if this happens because you get a 'spark'
effect), it is safe to follow through to the 4th hit - all 4 hits are
guaranteed and the damage is massive (around 50%).  If you don't MC with the
first hit, then it's usually safest to stop after either the first or second
punch (anyone who knows what they're doing will duck the high crescent and
then you are DEAD!).  You can often surprise your opponent with f,N,4,1 then
going straight into a u/f+4 liftkick float as your opponent 'wakes up' and
tries to retaliate.

f,f,f+3: A bog-standard running jumpkick, has fairly high priority, leaves
you at a slight advantage when blocked, and is useful for putting pressure
onto a turtling opponent.

b+1+2: The headbutt is a fairly risky attack, but can be very useful in some
situations and can do very high damage.  Its main use is as a counter attack,
it effectively ducks unerneath high strikes, so use it against anything that
could normally be ducked (such as Jin's white heron combos, Eddy and
Yoshimitsu's spinning high kicks, etc.)

d/b+4,4: The rave spin is a classic Lei technique, but it is always risky to
follow through with the 2nd hit in case the 1st is blocked and the 2nd is
ducked.  The 1st hit on its own gives a special 'float' and your opponent
can't QR (quick recover) on the landing, so it is often better to perform
just the 1st hit, and if it connects, follow up with a ground juggle (such as
4~4,3,3).

d/b+4,D: Performing the 1st hit of a rave spin allows a change to the snake
stance by holding D, and if the sweep connects, you can juggle with SNS
techniques before the opponent lands.  For more on this, see the juggles
section.

(u/b_u/f)+2: The elbow drop is a fairly high-risk but reasonably powerful
ground attack, and also works against a standing opponent.  Note that it
leaves you in the PLD position, so it's often good to deliberately miss an
elbow drop from way outside hit range, and follow up with a technique from
PLD as your opponent runs in to retaliate.

(u_u/f_u/b)+4: Lei's liftkick, when performed as u/f+4, is one of his most
useful techniques, and is his easiest juggle starter (all others, apart from
a basic d/f+2 right uppercut, require a different position or stance to
initiate).  It has a very fast execution time, and is great for situations
where your opponent gets close to you and tries to rush you with endless
combos - as soon as you see an opening in his offense (as he recovers from
one combo before the next can start), u/f+4 will take him out and set up a
nice high-damage float combo.

(WS)4: The rising front kick works as a reasonably damaging low-risk counter
attack after you block a low attack from your opponent, and also acts as a
simple d/b+4 followup (as the sweep recovers in a crouch, you can get a WS
attack as soon as you recover).

--------------------------
[BK: back-turned position]
--------------------------

BK:1: The high backfist isn't a particularly useful attack.  It is okay if
you counter with it, as you can follow up with another back-turn attack and
your opponent will probably be too surprised to block low, so a rave spin,
throw attempt, or low backfist juggle often makes a good followup.  The other
primary use for this attack is simply to use it as a way of moving closer to
your opponent while your back is turned, often tempting them to go for an
attack that you can counter with your next back-turn technique, as it's easy
for them to underestimate the fast recovery time of your high backfist.

BK:d+1: The low backfist is one of Lei's most devastatingly effective moves,
although it does very little damage on its own, it is very quick, hits low,
gives numerous guaranteed followup attacks if it hits, and doesn't leave you
at much of a disadvantage if it's blocked.  See the juggle section for more
info on following up this attack.

BK:2: The back uppercut is a very useful juggle starter, although its main
disadvantage is that it has a noticably long execution time and is more
easily countered than many of the other BK techniques.  It also has a very
short range, so it's usually best to use this in situations where you have
your back turned after certain blocked attacks, such as the guard melting
punches, or jumping crescents.  See the juggle section for more info.

BK:4: The back midkick, although fairly weak, is the fastest mid-height
attack from the BK position and has fairly good range.  It is a useful
followup to a blocked low backfist, as many opponents stay blocking low,
expecting another low backfist.  If you try to mix up low attacks with the
back uppercut or backflips, your opponent will often counter in time, but the
back midkick is usually quick enough to get you out of danger.

BK:3+4,3+4,3+4: Lei's triple backflips can make useful okizeme, but are very
risky against a standing opponent - use at your own risk!  Note that in
Tekken 3 they leave you in the BK position, so they can be mixed up with high
and low backfists for some confusing chain combos that keep you in the BK
position.

BK:(u/b_u/f)+2: The elbow drop from BK is identical to the forward-facing
equivalent.  It can make a damaging (non-guaranteed) end to a low backfist
juggle, or, like the forward-facing version, can just be used as a sneaky way
to get into the PLD position and follow up with a rave spin or double kick
float.

* Remember that 1+3 and 2+4 throws can be attempted from the BK position!

-------------------
[SNS: snake stance]
-------------------

SNS:1+3: The dragon stance change and throw attempt is not exactly a useful
move, it is usually better to perform this the 'long' way, ie, sidestep to
the dragon stance and tap 1 for the throw.  This way, you don't have to
commit yourself to the throw until the last minute, you can react to your
opponent and perform a different dragon stance technique if necessary.

SNS:1,1,1,1,1,1,[F]: The 6 hopping punches all hit high, so they are easily
ducked and countered.  They have the advantage of being extremely quick to
start, and do reasonable damage if you MC with the first hit, so they can be
useful against an over-aggressive opponent.  Holding F to return to the snake
stance is virtually suicidal if the punches are blocked, so use that
carefully.

SNS:2,2,2,[F]: The 3 stabbing punches are a much more useful attack.  If you
MC with the first hit, your opponent can say goodbye to about 50% energy.
The disadvantage is that there is a very long recovery time for the last hit,
so even if it hits, you have to be ready to block your opponent's counter
attack.  A stance change to the dragon stance after the 1st or 2nd hit is
usually quite safe, but don't do the panther stance change on the 3rd hit
unless you are sure that your opponent is slow to retaliate.

SNS:3: The falldown kick is a great move for those situations where you're
trying to confuse your opponent with a series of unpredictable attacks.  It's
nice to initiate this after sidestepping out of a punch rush on the first
hit, ie, f,N,1,SS,3 - to leave your opponent in a permanent state of 'what
the hell ...?'.  If you don't hit with it, remember it leaves you in the FCD
position, so there is a good range of followup attacks (cartwheel, rave spin,
etc.).

SNS:4: The low jab kick is rarely blocked, so it is a nice technique to fall
back on when you need a quick hit to finish your opponent (again, a punch
rush is a good way to get this: f,N,1,SS,4).  Note that it returns you to the
snake stance, so you can often use this hit to annoy your opponent into
retaliation, then get a MC with the SNS:2,2,2 stabbing punches.  This move
also has a useful effect in juggle combos, see the juggle section for more on
this.

--------------------
[DRG: dragon stance]
--------------------

DRG:1: The spin & throw attempt is a fairly useful technique if it
isn't over-used.  The spin 'execution time' is long enough for the throw to
be ducked on reflex, but it can still take people by surprise if you don't
use it too much.  It is also nice to use this if you get to the dragon stance
by carefully sidestepping your opponent's attacks, you can often get a
sidethrow from it.  See the throw descriptions for more info.

DRG:1+2,[F]: The double arm strike is a very quick attack and does good
damage.  Holding F for a change to the tiger stance is useful if it's
blocked, because TGS:4 will take most people by surprise.  If the double arm
strike hits, the opponent is knocked quite far, and the tiger stance change
will virtually kill any okizeme options you may have had, so only change
stance if you think it's likely to be blocked.

DRG:2,[F]: The uppercut is fairly powerful and floats on MC, so it's a
reasonably useful juggle starter.  As with the double arm strike, a tiger
stance change is also useful if it's likely to be blocked.

DRG:3,3: This is identical to 3,3 from a normal forward-facing stance and
really has the same use.

DRG:4,1,2,3,4_(d+4): This is the same as the rush combo from a normal
forward-facing stance, and is a nice counter-attack option to keep in mind if
your opponent makes the mistake of thinking that you're vulnerable in this
stance - as in a normal stance, the MC damage is around 50%.

---------------------
[PNS: panther stance]
---------------------

PNS:1~2: The double lowpunch combo is one of Lei's most useful attacks.  It
makes great okizeme on a rising opponent, and the MC damage can be nearly
50%.  The ability to mix this up with the PNS:2 uppercut makes the panther
stance one of the most useful.

PNS:2,[1,2,1]: The uppercut is one of Lei's most useful floating tools.  If
you get into the panther stance by sidestepping your opponent's attack, the
uppercut is often 'free', and this is always the best attack option from
here.  If you initiate it as 2,1, the guard melting punches combo will start
if the uppercut is blocked, so tap 2,1 to continue it.  This is risky against
opponents who use a lot of reversals, so against someone like this it is
better to do 2,f+2+4 to buffer in a reversal break after the uppercut
instead.

PNS:3,[B]: The sweep is a fairly weak attack, but often takes people by
surprise.  Hold B to get to the SQB stance where you can usually surprise
your opponent with SQB:3 and maybe risk the unblockable phoenix kick as
okizeme.  The other use for the sweep is in situations where you are about to
attmempt okizeme from the panther stance (going for 1~2 as they rise) and you
realise that your opponent is staying down so that your 1~2 will whiff
completely - in this situation, use the sweep to make sure you at least get 1
hit, and are returned to a normal stance.

PNS:4,2,1,2,3_(4,[SS]): This is basically the same as the regular
forward-facing stance combo starting with F+4, with the same crane stance
change possible on the last hit.  Although risky, it is useful against
opponents who don't have a deep understanding of Lei's moves, and you can use
it to chain together some big 'combos', such as:
f,N,1,SS(SNS),4(SNS),2,2,2,F(PNS),4,2,1,2,4,SS(CRS),4,3,2,3
... which can completely overwhelm your opponent if they don't know the
interruptable parts (ie, the stance changes).

-------------------
[TGS: tiger stance]
-------------------

TGS:1_2: The overhead swipes are very powerful attacks.  The MC damage is
huge.  The basic damage is not very high on a crouching opponent, but it can
cause a 'stagger', dropping them to one knee.  If it's blocked, it leaves you
at a slight advantage, and a u/f+4 liftkick floater very often connects after
a blocked TGS:1_2 if your opponent attempts to retaliate.

TGS:3: The high crescent is initially identical to f,N,3 from a normal
forward-facing stance, has the same risky-but-powerful attributes.  The
difference between the f,N,3 version is that this one doesn't extend into a
mid/lowkick guessing game, but can have a punch rush tagged straight onto it
with no f,N required, ie: TGS:3,1,2,1,2,3_4 is a high crescent and punch
rush.  The usual sidestep stance changing is possible during the punch rush.

TGS:4: The fast low sweep is another very useful technique.  It's rarely
blocked (because of its speed) and has a similar effect to the first hit of a
rave spin, floating the opponent slightly in such a way that they can't QR
on the landing, meaning a 4~4,3,3 bounce juggle is guaranteed after
connecting TGS:4.  See the juggles section for more info on this.

-------------------
[CRS: crane stance]
-------------------

CRS:1: The guard melting punch is a brilliant attack option, it does massive
damage as a MC, and gives you a back-turned advantage (and a confused
opponent) if it's blocked.

CRS:2: This is another great attack option from the crane stance, and is
useful as okizeme if you sidestep to the crane stance after a punch rush
juggle.  Connecting this leaves you and your opponent back-to-back, with you
at the advantage, and a guaranteed low backfist followup.  A rave spin is
also guaranteed from that situation, but the opponent is treated as 'already
floating' and the high crescent doesn't connect.  You can also attempt a back
throw from this situation, but this is quite risky and your opponent is often
knocked out of throwing range.

CRS:3,4,2,3: The crane dance is useful if it's not over-used.  The 2nd hit is
low and is rarely blocked, which guarantees the 3rd hit.  The last hit floats
if it connects, although it is quite risky.  This combo can be delayed at any
point, so you can really confuse your opponent by bringing it out slowly to
trick them into attempting to counter you, increasing the chance of landing
the floating kick at the end.  It makes great okizeme, with even the last hit
connecting if your opponent stays down without moving.

CRS:4: This move has a pretty long execution time so it is slightly risky,
but often takes people by surprise and looks great when it hits.  It is also
a nice okizeme tactic, and can hit a floored opponent if you initiate it from
the correct distance.

---------------------
[DRS: drunken stance]
---------------------

DRS:1: The drunk punch is very powerful and a lot of people just seem to walk
straight into it.  Watch Lei closely as he sways and staggers in the drunken
stance, there is one point where he moves significantly closer to his
opponent, so if they are just outside the range of the drunk punch when you
first go into DRS, wait a little while and you may be able to surprise them
when you get close enough.

DRS:3+4: The falling low kicks can be seen coming a mile away, the buildup is
so long.  It can be useful to use this as okizeme (a quick f+3+4,3+4 on a
rising opponent).  It can also be used like the elbow drop as a sneaky way to
get into a liedown position, in this case FCD, which has a good range of
followup attacks.

* Remember you can get an automatic mid/high punch reversal from here by just
standing in the drunken stance - and that the f+3+4 motion from a normal
stance can be used to break out of your opponent's combos too.  The drunken
surprise exchange does no damage, but leaves you at your opponent's side
where you should be able to surprise them with a few hits or even a
sidethrow, although nothing appears to be guaranteed in these situations.

-------------------------------------
[SQB: sleeping queen of birds stance]
-------------------------------------

SQB:3,3,3,3: As in Tekken 2, the hopping kicks are reasonably effective,
knock the opponent down if they hit, and can have the unblockable chained
on at any point.

SQB:4: Like all unblockables, Lei's phoenix kick is extremely risky against
people who know what they're doing.  It can sometimes surprise a
floored/rising opponent, and is a good scrub-destroyer, for situations like
Eddy starting a sweep combo from about half a mile away.

-------------------------
[PLD: play dead position]
-------------------------

PLD:3,4: As with most versions of the rave spin, it's safest to perform only
the first hit in case it is blocked - connecting the first hit does allow
guaranteed juggles that will allow you to do about as much damage as the full
rave spin anyway.

PLD:3+4: Lei's most common juggle starter, this is one of his main
techniques, and should be frequently mixed up with PLD:3 in order for you to
stand a chance of connecting it.

PLD:4: The rising midkick comes out quicker than the double kick (which can
often be blocked on reflex), and is useful for situations where you just need
to finish off a nearly-dead opponent - just do d+3+4,4 and if you've been
mixing up enough low attacks, you have a 90% guaranteed hit against most
players.

PLD:D#+1: To roll over into the SLD position, hold D on the joystick, tap 1,
and keep D held down until Lei stops rolling and is left in the SLD position.

---------------------
[SLD: slide position]
---------------------

SLD:4~3: The slide can take a lot of people by surprise (and has a resonably
long range) as long as you don't always do it by just going d+1+2,4~3,
because most people will recognize the way you drop straight into the slide
position and will know what's coming next.  If you get here from rolling over
from PLD, or are left in this position after getting thrown or knocked down,
then you stand a much higher chance of surprising your opponent with the
slide.

* Note that there is no basic rising midkick from this position - pressing 4
gives a low kick, so all instant attacks from the SLD position hit low.  The
only way to get a mid attack is to either put a rising midkick onto the end
of a forward or back roll, or roll over to PLD and do a different attack from
there.

------------------------
[FCD: facedown position]
------------------------

FCD:3~4,[4]: This is the only rave spin starter that doesn't give a
decent guaranteed followup attack if you don't follow through with the full
rave spin.  It's often best to perform just the 3~4 and watch closely to see
if it is worth following through with the 2nd hit - don't commit yourself
until the last minute.  Note that 3~4 leaves you in PLD position, so it
allows you to link techniques between different liedown positions.

FCD:4~3: The FCD cartwheel kick can be performed as many times as you like,
as it always returns you to FCD.  This can take a lot of people by surprise
as it hits mid and has a fairly good range to it.  Also, like the BK:1 high
backfist, you can use it as a way to move closer to your opponent whilst
staying in your current position.

-------------------------
[KND: knockdown position]
-------------------------

KND:3+4: You are likely to get the 'spring up' move if you go for the
floating double kick from PLD but your opponent gets to the other side of
your head, effectively putting you into KND instead.  This move is not as
useless as it was in TK2 as is now treated as a mid attack and does damage.

KND:D#+1: As with rolling from PLD to SLD, you can roll from KND to FCD by
holding D, tapping 1, and keeping D held until you stop rolling and are left
in the FCD position.  This is a _very_ useful technique to learn, as you are
usually left in KND when your opponent knocks you down, and a good way to get
up can be to roll to FCD (your opponent will probably think you are just
siderolling to get up) and throw a cartwheel or rave spin at them.

* Note that KND is the only liedown position that allows you to perform the
basic 'lightning kick' rising attack (d+4).

----------------------
[Throws and reversals]
----------------------

1+3: Lei's flying sky kick is always a better choice than the 2+4 neck
wringer throw because it leaves you standing far away, with the chance for
some okizeme.  Run towards your opponent for a stamp or barge if they stay
down or roll back.  If they sideroll, go for a running slide or tap 1+2 while
running for a body dive, most people don't expect this.

2+4: Not as effective as 1+3, the neck wringer's main advantage (apart from
that lovely neck-snapping sound effect) is the fact that it is the only one
that needs {%2%} as a throw escape, so obviously it is good to mix up your
throws against someone who consistently escapes them.

DRG:1,[1+2]: The neck shaker is a great looking throw if you can get it out,
and also has the advantage of being able to be linked to the life gain drink.
Note that the life gain reduces the damage caused by the throw, so only use
it if your energy is low.  If you use the throw without the life gain, it
appears to knock your opponent quite far away, but they are actually in range
for a u/f+2 elbow drop, that appears to be guaranteed (I've never seen it
escaped) for some pretty good damage.  If you do the life gain, you are left
in the drunken stance, it's usually best to hit 1 just to get yourself out of
it as soon as possible because you are too far away to use the DRS anyway.

f,f+1+2: The trip is my personal favourite, hardly anyone ever breaks out of
it, and you can extend its range by holding the F position for a short while
on both 'f' taps, which can help when punishing a blocked attack that pushes
you back slightly outside of throwing range.

u/f+1+2: The trip & elbow is also quite useful (as with the trip, it requires
{%1+2%} to break out) and leaves both players lying side-by-side, with a
guaranteed rising sweep for Lei.

(d_d/b_FC)+(1+3_2+4): The low combo break leaves you at a slight advantage
when successfully pulled off, and is useful for breaking out of 10-strings.
It is also useful in any situation where you expect a low attack, such as
breaking Eddy's sweep combos, or even as a nasty (but risky) okizeme trick
against rising low kicks/sweeps.

f+3+4: The drunken stance move can also be used as a mid/high punch reversal
(does no damage but breaks their combo and leaves Lei at their side, with a
slight advantage).  Again, this is useful for breaking out of 10-strings, or
for predictable combos where you know a mid/high punch is coming.






----------------------------------------------------------------------
    (ii)  stance switching
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Lei's ability to change stance in the middle of a combo is one of his most
powerful techniques, if it is used intelligently.  If it's abused, it can
leave Lei in real trouble.  If you change stance after a combo hit that is
blocked, your opponent can _always_ hit you before you can do _anything_ in
your new stance.  You have to rely on the fact that a lot of people panic
when they see you change stance and don't really see how vulnerable you are.
This is why it is important to mix up your stance-changing techniques as much
as possible (although there are some fairly reliable ones that can be used
quite often against a lot of people).

The following stance changes are possible during combos:

command                 stance

F+4,2,1,2,4,SS          CRS
f,N,1,SS                SNS
f,N,1,2,SS              DRG
f,N,1,2,1,SS            PNS
f,N,1,2,1,2,SS          TGS
f,N,1,2,1,2,4,SS        CRS
d/b+4,D                 SNS
BK:d+4,D                SNS
SNS:1,[1,1,1,1,1],F     SNS
SNS:2,[2],F             DRG
SNS:2,2,2,F             PNS
SNS:4                   SNS
DRG:1+2,F               TGS
DRG:2,F                 TGS
PNS:3,B                 SQB
PNS:4,2,1,2,4,SS        CRS
TGS:3,1,SS              SNS
TGS:3,1,2,SS            DRG
TGS:3,1,2,1,SS          PNS
TGS:3,1,2,1,2,SS        TGS
TGS:3,1,2,1,2,4,SS      CRS

Note that some commands do not end with SS - these are the only stance
changes where you don't sidestep into your new stance.  All other stance
changes (to the SNS/DRG/PNS/TGS/CRS stance 'ring') involve a sidestep,
including the basic (f+2+3)_(SS+1+4)_(SS+2+3) to get into the snake stance,
and subsequent sidestepping to move between stances.

It is useful to know this, because stance changing can be particularly
effective if you use it to sidestep your opponent's attacks, and this often
means that you have a guaranteed counter attack from your new stance.

Once you get into an animal stance, you can perform basic sidesteps to get to
another one.  There are effectively two 'branches' to the stance 'ring': the
snake->dragon->tiger branch and the snake->panther->crane branch.  The
commands for advancing forwards or backwards along each branch are
effectively swapped around when you change the direction you are facing
(1P/2P side).  I personally find the most useful sidestep changes to learn
are snake->panther and panther->crane, partly because there is a useful and
powerful range of attack options from the panther and crane stances, and also
because there seems to be a bit of a 'recovery' time on stepping to/from the
dragon stance, which makes the dragon/tiger branch more awkward to work with
when it comes to sidestep stance changing for countering purposes.

The sidestep directions for each branch are:

snake--->dragon--->tiger--->snake    SSL to advance: 1P side=u,N
						     2P side=d,N
snake--->panther--->crane--->snake   SSR to advance: 1P side=d,N
						     2P side=u,N

When you sidestep out of a combo (e.g. punch rush), you can sidestep in
either direction, but sometimes it makes sense to choose the direction
carefully if you want to go straight into another stance change, because 2
sidesteps in the same direction are more useful than 2 sidesteps in opposite
directions, ie, they are more likely to get you further around to your
opponent's side, or even their back.  Here are a few examples of how this can
be used:

f,N,1,SSR,SSR, attack from PNS
f,N,1,SSR,SSR,SSR, attack from CRS
f,N,1,2,1,SSR,SSR, attack from CRS

Note that stepping out of the punch rush is done in the same direction as the
subsequent stance changes, this is _the_ most important thing to remember
when doing something like this, and if you do it right, you should get around
to your opponent's side or back for a 'free' attack.

Here are a few chain-combos done with stance switching, none of this is
guaranteed as there are plenty of 'interruptable' points, but a lot of these
can still be useful:

f,N,1,SS,SNS:2,2,2
f,N,1,SS,SNS:4,SNS:2,2,F,DRG:1+2,F,TGS:4
f,N,1,SS,SNS:2,2,2,F,PNS:2(float)
f,N,1,SS,SNS:2,2,2,F,PNS:1~2
f,N,1,2,SS,DRG:1
f,N,1,2,SS,DRG:4,1,N,u/f+4(float)
f,N,1,2,1,SS,PNS:2(float)
f,N,1,2,1,SS,PNS:1~2
f,N,1,2,1,SS,PNS:4,2,1,2,4,SS,CRS:4
f,N,1,2,1,SS,PNS:3,B,SQB:3,3,4
f,N,1,2,1,2,SS,TGS:4
f,N,1,2,1,2,SS,TGS:2,N,u/f+4(float)
f,N,1,2,1,2,4,SS,4
f,N,1,2,1,2,4,SS,3,4,2,3
f,N,1,SSL,SNS:SSL,DRG:1(side/back throw)
f,N,1,2,SSL,DRG:SSL,TGS:2
f,N,1,SSR,SNS:SSR,PNS:2(float)
f,N,1,SSR,SNS:SSR,PNS:1~2
f,N,1,SSR,SNS:SSR,PNS:SSR,CRS:2(stun),BK:d+1(float)
f,N,1,2,1,SSR,PNS:SSR,CRS:4

etc...



----------------------------------------------------------------------
    (iii) using the 4 liedown positions
----------------------------------------------------------------------


It's good to practice the moves from all 4 liedown positions and try to
recognize which position you're in at any time, as you often get left lying
in strange positions after getting thrown, reversed, or knocked down.

You can get straight into PLD with d+3+4 and SLD with d+1+2.  The easiest
way to get into KND is to tap 4~4 to start the rolling kicks, and the easiest
way to get into FCD is to perform a 4~3 cartwheel kick.

Note that if your opponent jumps over you while you are lying down, this
effectively changes your current liedown position.  For example, if you do
d+1+2 to get into SLD and your opponent runs at you with a jumping kick of
some kind, if they land on the other side of you, you are actually now in
FCD, so you can cartwheel or rave spin straight away.

You can move between a face-up or face-down position by using the 1 button.
to go from face-down to face-up (FCD->KND or SLD->PLD), simply tap 1.  To go
from face-up to face-down (KND->FCD or PLD->SLD) hold the joystick in the D
position, tap 1, and don't release the joystick until Lei stops rolling in
his new face-down position.  Note that D+1 will autoselect 1 when lying face
down, so you can stay rolling about by holding D and constantly hitting 1,
for a very nasty/cheap way to stay out of your opponent's way :)

Getting knocked down generally leaves you in the KND position (although there
are many exceptions).  A good way to get up is to hold D and tap 1 to roll
over into FCD (it looks like you're just siderolling to get up) and go
straight into a cartwheel or rave spin.  Rolling from KND to FCD is a handy
way to increase your range of rising attacks.

Also, rolling between positions can be used simply to confuse your opponent,
for example, instead of doing d+3+4,3+4 to get a float, try d+1+2,1,3+4
instead - seeing your drop into SLD and then flip over is likely to make your
opponent panic and block low.

If you roll towards your opponent from a liedown position, note that it must
be initiated from PLD or FCD to allow you to put a rave spin on the end of
the roll.  It's always better to do a single sweep (3) on the end of the roll
than a full 3~4 rave spin, as it doesn't leave you so vulnerable when
blocked, and you can still do just as much damage as a rave spin by doing
(WS)4, 4~4,3,3 if you do connect the sweep.



----------------------------------------------------------------------
    (iv)  using the back-turn
----------------------------------------------------------------------


There are usually 2 ways to get into a back-turned position: either by doing
b+3+4 from a normal stance, or by performing any combo that recovers into a
back-turned position (see the pos/stance column in the movelist to see which
ones recover into BK).


It's good to make use of b+3+4 (although very few people seem to bother with
it).  Note that performing b+3+4 actually makes Lei take a step backwards,
significantly increasing the distance between him and his opponent.  This is
one of the most important things to remember with Lei, it is a very powerful
countering tool.  It's very effective when you trick your opponent into
attacking you when they are just about within hit range, and you b+3+4 to
move yourself just out of his reach.  Your opponent will usually then recover
inside _your_ hit range, so you can go for a rave spin or low backfist
juggle.  A back uppercut juggle gives the best damage potential, but they
have to be very close for you to connect it, so use this one carefully.

Here's an example for how you can use this: against a Paul player who lives
entirely off death fists (and don't they all ...), hang around just outside
the hit range of his death fist, and deliberately whiff something like a
u/f+4 liftkick.  As soon as you land, if Paul is already moving in for the
death fist, hit b+3+4 straight away, and if you timed it right (and got your
distance right) you should move just out of reach, and he should recover
right next to you with your back turned.  As mentioned above, go for a back
uppercut if he's close enough, otherwise a rave spin will do the job nicely.


Also, it can be useful to pull out b+3+4 in situations where both players are
very close up and are throwing out quick attacks to try and get the
advantage.  Instead of the usual high or low punching, try something like:
d+1,b+3+4,BK:4,d+1,u/f+4.

The first d+1 is just a quick low punch to annoy your opponent into a quick
retaliation.  Pulling out a back-turn straight after means their attack is
likely to miss completely, letting your back midkick counter them for a small
but useful amount of damage.  The 2nd lowpunch is an attempt to annoy
them into trying to unleash something more powerful this time, and hopefully
they'll walk right into your u/f+4 liftkick, so you get a juggle out of it
too.  Obviously none of this is guaranteed, it's just useful to have b+3+4 to
move yourself out of reach and frustrate your opponent into taking an
unneccessary risk.


Note that you can perform your basic 1+3 or 2+4 throws while your back is
turned.  If you get a 'missed throw' animation, you return to a back-turned
position (only Lei and Xiaoyu will return to BK, all other characters face
forward after a BK:throw misses).

There are ways in which Lei can get himself very close to his opponent, with
his back turned, and with a slight time advantage.  He gets into this
situation after his 3~4,[U#] triple jumping crescents or f,N,2,1,2,1 guard
melting punches (or panther stance variant) is blocked.  In these situations,
a low backfist juggle, rave spin, or throw attempt will all work if your
opponent doesn't duck.  Try these a few times until your opponent starts to
duck, then mix up with a back uppercut juggle instead.  Note that against the
CPU, a back uppercut juggle always seems to work 100% in this situation.

Another useful technique to know is CRS:2, which leaves both players
back-to-back with Lei at the advantage (if it hits), giving the possibility
of getting a back throw while _your_ back is turned - see the strategy
section on the crane stance for more info on that.


Also, here's another thing to bear in mind: if you get hit by a combo from
behind, you automatically 'slide' out of range after every 2 or 3 hits, but
stay with your back turned.  When this happens, watch closely for the 'slide'
to start and you can usually get a low backfist juggle or rave spin for free,
and sometimes a back uppercut juggle, but it's a little risky.  If you're
feeling nasty, you can deliberately turn your back and let your opponent
start to hit you (if they are predictable enough and you know a combo of
about 4+ hits is coming) and get a guaranteed counter attack.

This is one I sometimes use against other Lei players: deliberately whiff
a 3,3 high crescent/lowkick combo from outside hit range.  You are left with
your back turned, and your opponent (if he's predictable enough) is likely
to come at you with a punch rush.  He'll connect the first 2 punches (for
barely any damage), you automatically 'slide' out of range, smack 2 for a
MC back uppercut and then you get to juggle a load more off his lifebar - so
you end up having done way more damage.  This is completely EVIL (although
almost suicidal), which is why it's so cool :)



----------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Juggles:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Juggle starters can be divided into different types, as different juggles are
possible from different floating hits.

Type 1: high floats
-------------------
* PLD:3+4 (double kick)
* Last hit of 9-string: 1,2,1,3+4,3+4,3+4,1,1,2 (high floating back uppercut)

Type 2: low floats, fast recovery
---------------------------------
* u/f+4 (liftkick)
* PNS:2 (panther uppercut)
* d/f+2 (basic right uppercut, only floats if opponent is not crouching, but
shouldn't require a major counter)

Type 3: low floats, long recovery
---------------------------------
* BK:2
* 3rd hit of f,N,2,1,2,1 or PNS:2,1,2,1 if first and second hits are blocked
(3rd guard melting punch)
* last hit of CRS:3,4,2,3 (crane dance)
* 2nd hit of 1+2~2 (turning punch & uppercut: also 2nd hit guaranteed if 1st
hit MC's(?))
* DRG:2 (dragonstance uppercut: must MC to float)

Type 4: low backfist starter
----------------------------
* BK:d+1 (low backfist)
* CRS:2,BK:d+1 (if crane stance backfist connects, BK:d+1 low backfist is
usually guaranteed)

Type 5: 1/2 rave spin/sweep starter
-----------------------------------
* d/b+4
* BK:d+4
* PLD:3
* PLD:(f_b),3
* FCD:(f_b),3
* TGS:4 (tiger stance low sweep)
* 9th hit of 10-string: 1,2,1,3+4,2,1,4,1,4,4

Type 6: 1/2 rave spin & snake stance change
-------------------------------------------
* d/b+4,D
* BK:d+4,D

Type 7: bounce-off-the-floor starter
------------------------------------
* TGS:1_2 (overhead swipe: must MC to get bounce/float)



This is the juggle table, giving a list of all juggles that are possible, and
the 1234567 columns denote which juggle starters will allow that juggle.
The symbols in the 1234567 columns have the following meanings:
- = not possible
* = possible
@ = sometimes possible (may require close/far range)
? = unconfirmed

In the juggle column, a space is used to separate canned combos
e.g.: 1+2~1, BK:d+1, BK:d+4
or:   1, f,N,1,2,1,2,4
... have spaces to show where a slight pause may be necessary.

*TIP: if you go for a punch rush in a juggle, and it misses, don't stop!
Follow through right up to the midkick, as this keeps you moving forwards,
and can get you out of the range of your opponent's rising attacks, leaving
you with your back turned.  You can often use this to your advantage to get
your opponent's rising attack to miss, leaving you with the chance to
retaliate with a back-turned rave spin or other BK technique.




----------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Ground cheese / okizeme:
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Learn the rising habits of your opponent, and adapt your okizeme strategy
according to what you expect your opponent to do.

Here are some general techniques:


If your opponent stays still without moving:
--------------------------------------------

3~4,D - jumping crescent and falldown does some nasty damage (you have to
pull D to make it connect on a floored opponent) although it does get a bit
boring/annoying if you keep using it.

u/f+2 - the elbow drop is slow to start, giving your opponent time to
recover or sideroll, but does fairly good damage and lets you follow up with
at least a sweep from PLD.  Also you can use it from a back turned position
after connecting something like 5 low backfists, instead of finishing with a
sweep, a more damaging (although not guaranteed) finish is the back-turned
elbow drop.

d/b+4 - the sweep doesn't do much damage, but it's probably the quickest
attack option on a downed opponent.


If your opponent rolls back:
----------------------------

4~4,3,3 - the rolling kicks are usually all guaranteed if the first hit
connects on a backrolling opponent.

3~4,[U#] - the jumping crescent doesn't require a falldown to connect on a
backrolling opponent.  Do all 3 if your opponent doesn't get the message and
tries to get up after the 1st one hits, you should catch them with the 3rd
one too.

u/f+2 - the elbow drop usually catches a back-roller as well.

4~3 - the cartwheel kick is great against back rollers and does pretty good
damage.

b+1+2 - run right up to them and headbutt if you want to have some fun, it's
not guaranteed but you'd be surprised at how effective it is.


If your opponent siderolls:
---------------------------

3~4,D - jumping crescent and falldown should catch a sideroller, unless you
leave it too late.

d/b+4 - the sweep should hit a side-rolling opponent pretty easily, although
the damage isn't very good.


If your opponent quick-recovers to a low block:
-----------------------------------------------

Anything that hits mid is useful here, a punch rush & midkick, or a u/f+4
liftkick is usually good in this situation.


If your opponent quick-recovers to a mid/high block:
----------------------------------------------------

A rave spin is the best option here, although as always, it's safer to only
perform the 1st hit (in case it's blocked) and follow up with a 4~4,3,3 type
juggle if it does hit.



Here are some more techniques that can be useful in certain common
situations:


After juggling with a punch rush & midkick:
-------------------------------------------

Sidestep on the last hit to change to the crane stance.  Walk towards your
opponent and try one of the following:

CRS:4 - will miss if your opponent siderolls, otherwise you stand a good
chance of connecting it.  If they stay down without moving, aim for their
head, or you could easily miss it.

CRS:3,4,2,3 - the crane dance is very useful, if they make _any_ attempt to
get up or roll, they will almost certainly take at least 1 hit, and possibly
get floated on the last one (in which case, you can juggle and repeat the
whole thing again).  If they stay down without moving, you'll connect the
last hit too.

Stand close, then back out of range at the last minute, to trick them into
missing a rising kick, then counter with CRS:2 (and low backfist juggle if it
connects) or CRS:1 for some massive damage (and a back-turned guessing game
if it's blocked).


After juggling with a punch rush with no kick:
----------------------------------------------

Sidestep on the last punch to change to the tiger stance.  Walk towards your
opponent and go for TGS:4 if it looks like they're going to stay down without
moving, or TGS:1_2 if they try anything else.  If they get up in time to
block the overhead swipe, follow up with u/f+4, as you will often catch them
with this if they try to hit you with anything, due to the long block stun
caused by the overhead swipe.


After a rave spin juggle with SNS:2,2:
--------------------------------------

Perform it as SNS:2,2,2,F so by the time your opponent lands, you're in the
panther stance.  If they stay down, hit them with PNS:3, otherwise PNS:1~2
will do decent damage.


After any knock-down that leaves you close to your opponent:
------------------------------------------------------------

Standing close to them, try f+2+3 to get into SNS, then sidestep to PNS when
you think they will go for a rising kick - if you time it correctly, you'll
sidestep their rising attack and get a free uppercut or double lowpunch combo
from the side.

If they tend to use the lightning kick (or a basic rising lowkick/sweep) when
getting up, stand right by their feet and use your low combo break when they
try it.  This is very risky (in fact, it's blatantly showing off) but it will
really annoy your opponent if you can do it >:)

(5) Lei Vs other characters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Vs Xiaoyu:
----------
Xiaoyu can give Lei real hassle, you have to be damn careful against her.
Don't lie down too much if she uses a lot of jumping backflips.  If she goes
into the phoenix stance, knock her out of it with a rave spin if she's close,
or 3~4,U jumping crescents if she's further away.  If she goes for the 3-hit
combo that ends in her power punch, use your punch reversal on the last hit.
Your 3,3 high crescent, lowkick combo is useful when you're up close, as the
2nd hit will connect if she goes into the phoenix stance.


Vs Law:
-------
Playing dead is usually pretty effective against Law, a lot of Law players
will usually try to knock you out of it with a dragon tail or
lowkick,flipkick combo that will miss if you stay still.  If they do this,
you can always punish them with a powerful liedown technique.  Watch out for
his 3 hit combo that has a low kick in the middle, this will hit you while
you're down, and so will his backward flipkick.  Use your low combo break
against his dragon tail if you see it coming, and punch reversal against his
rave war combo or his 3-hit uppercut combo.

Vs Nina:
--------
Nina is a real pain in the ass.  If your opponent over-uses the divine cannon
combo (lowkick, floating midkick) then use your low combo break to get the
advantage.  You can usually expect Nina to use this a lot, because your
opponent will probably be expecting you to lie down a lot.  Use your punch
reversal against her double palm or stun chop.  If she uses a lot of
reversals, then hit her with rave spins, or throw from the dragon stance.
Don't turn your back too much, it's very hard to back-turn & counter when
she's doing divine cannon combos all the time.

Vs King:
--------
King is another character that can really punish you if you play dead, with
his damn ali-kick combos.  If he likes to use ground throws, do something
like 4~3 to get into the facedown position and rave spin his ass as soon as
he gets close.  A lot of King players like to show off with throws, so it's
often good to fight him close to lure him into trying it, then go for a u/f+4
liftkick juggle.  You can use your low combo break to get out of his
10-strings on the first ali-kick, or if your reactions are fast enough, go
for a punch reversal on the 3rd hit.  Be careful with using u/f+4 too much or
he'll use his kick reversal, and AFAIK it cannot be broken out of.

Vs Hwoarang:
------------
Hwoarang generally has real trouble hitting you while you're lying down, his
only quick attack being his short trip.  He does have some more powerful
attacks that will connect while you're down, but they are usually part of a
string that starts with a move that misses completely (such as his WS
crushing axe kicks or his chainsaw kicks).  If he does his 1,1,3,3 (2 quick
left punches, lowkick, high kick), use a combo break on the low kick, or
block it and headbutt to counter the last kick (it's high, so a headbutt
will always beat it).  Same goes for his low kick, floating high kick combo,
if you can see it coming.

Vs Paul:
--------
Lei's punch reversal really comes into its own against Paul, and is the
perfect antidote to his death fist, tile splitter and 10-hitters.  It's
usually best not to over-use it or he'll start using double jumpkicks
instead.  If he's predictable enough with the sweep & elbow, use your low
combo break on it.  Also if he death fists all the time (and most Pauls do),
make good use of b+3+4 to get yourself out of range, or use stance changes to
sidestep it.  Note that if he tries to sweep & elbow you while you're lying
down, he'll miss completely and you can get a free liedown attack on him.
Don't lie down too much if he makes good use of his forward somersault or
floor punch.

Vs Eddy:
--------
Keep your distance against Eddy, if you get too close to him then you're
going to be in real trouble.  It's not usually good to lie down too much
against him because he has so many moves that hit you while you're down.
Make good use of your low combo break against Eddy, whenever you know that a
low hit is coming (ie, most of the time), but it's not worth bothering with
your punch reversal unless your opponent consistently uses his quick 1,2
punches or d/f+2 elbow at the start of a round just to get a quick hit.
Turning your back and countering is usually pretty effective against Eddy,
but use it carefully or you could stand to take some ridiculous damage.  Use
your headbutt against his multiple spinning high kicks.

Vs Jin:
-------
Jin is a very strong character, and if he's played well, he can cause Lei
real problems.  You can usually expect him to throw out his u/f+4,4,4,4
jumping spin kicks (which will do nasty damage if you're lying down), so use
your low combo break against the first low sweep.  As with Nina, it's always
good to use plenty of low hits like rave spins and PNS:1~2 double lowpunch
combo, if he gets into the habit of reversing your punch rushes.  If you use
the u/f+4 liftkick, it's often a good idea to smack f+2+4 to buffer in a
reversal break just in case.  Watch out for his thunder god fist (and his
unblockable), the buildup is so low that it ducks underneath certain
mid-hitting moves, including your punch rush, so u/f+4 is always a better
countering option in these situations.  If he is always trying to float you
with punches/uppercuts of some kind, use your punch reversal, but be careful
with this against a Jin player who uses lots of double axe kicks and jumping
spin kicks.  Also: use your headbutt against his white heron combos (low
kick, 2 high punches, low or mid kick to end), you can usually counter the
high punches with it.

Vs Yoshimitsu:
--------------
Watch out for his d/b+1 sword swipe, it hits you while you're playing dead,
and so do quite a lot of his other unblockables.  Use your low combo break
against his multiple spinning lowkicks, and headbutt when he goes for his
high spin kicks.  If he sits down, and/or starts teleporting, you can usually
connect 4~4,3,3 rolling kicks on him, and if you get the first one, you'll
probably get all of them.  Forget your punch reversal unless he uses a lot of
spinning backhands or elbows.  His pogo sword is quite effective if you lie
down, but if he tries it while you're standing, go for 1+2~2 to make him give
up on that.

Vs Lei:
-------
I HATE playing Lei vs Lei matches!  As with Xiaoyu, use 3,3 when you're up
close and you'll often hit your opponent if they lie down.  Also, if your
opponent constantly plays dead then hit him with jumping crescents, elbow
drops, or sweeps.  If he goes for a punch rush, you can use your punch
reversal on him.  If he starts a 10-string (usually the result of stuffing up
a punch rush), use your low combo break on the 3rd hit.

This section _was_ going to be a huge in-depth guide for how to kick Lei's
ass, but I've decided to censor it at the last minute.  Track down an older
version of this FAQ to get the basics - or figure it out for yourself :)
