What is a Chicken Glitch Back-Throw?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A Chicken Glitch Back-Throw is a special bug/ glitch in the game that
        lets you perform a back-throw on your opponent regardless of the
        direction they are facing in.  Under ordinary circumstances you would
        have to be standing directly behind your opponent in order to execute
        a back-throw.  However, the Chicken Glitch Back-Throw will enable you
        to do a back throw on your opponent even when you and your opponent's
        characters are standing face-to-face with each other.
        When this move is performed properly, your opponent will not be able
        to duck or escape the back-throw.

What Characters (opponents) Can I Perform the Chicken Glitch Back-Throw On?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The Chicken Glitch Back-Throw will not work on all the characters.
        This particular maneuver will only work on characters that have
        reversal moves, specifically:

                                Anna Williams
                                Jin Kazama
                                Nina Williams
                                Paul Phoenix
                                Mokujin (must be imitating one of the character
s above)

        Note: Even though King has a reversal, the Chicken Glitch Back-Throw
        will not work on him since his reversal cannot be chickened (i.e. his
        reversal cannot be reversed).

What Characters Can Perform a Chicken Glitch Back-Throw?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        It is important to realize that not all characters can perform a
        Chicken Glitch Back-Throw.  Here is a list of all the characters and
        their respective back throws:
        Note: "None" means that a particular character cannot perform a Chicken
        Glitch Back-Throw.

        In addition, Mokujin can perform a Chicken Glitch Back-Throw when
        imitating certain characters.  If you'll notice, Mokujin can execute
        a Chicken Glitch Back-Throw with some characters that originally could
        not do them.  Also, some moves may or may not have changed depending on
        who Mokujin is imitating.  Some of the changes are for Eddy Gordo, 
        King,Kuma/Panda and Nina Williams.

How Do I Perform the Chicken Glitch Back-Throw?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Requirements: In order to perform the Chicken Glitch Back-Throw, you
        will need to select a character that can perform a Chicken Glitch
        Back-Throw (see the list above).  You will also need to be fighting
        against a character that this will work on (see section entitled
        "What Characters Can I Perform the Chicken Glitch Back-Throw On?"
        for specific characters).
        
        General Directions: In order to do a Chicken Glitch Back-Throw, simply
        Chicken your opponent's reversal when you attack them with a RIGHT kick
        (this trick works only with right kicks).  Of course, your opponent 
        will need to reverse your attack.  Once you chicken your opponent's 
        reversal move, perform one of your character's specific throws (see 
        list above) as soon as your character is able to.
        You do not have to run up to your opponent to do the throw.  If the
        throw was timed correctly, your character will suddenly appear behind
        your opponent and will execute the back throw without touching them.

        Specific Directions: (This is a more specific set of instructions and
        tips for those of you having trouble doing this)

        1.  Attack your opponent with a mid or high right kick that can be
            reversed.
            Note: some right kick attacks, such as a knee attack, cannot be
            reversed.  Low attacks also cannot be reversed, so make sure it is
            a mid or high right kick.

        2.  After pressing right kick, pause (no more than half a second) and
            press f + (RP+RK).  You may want to hold forward on the joystick
            and press (RP+RK) rapidly as an alternative method.
            Note: Nothing will happen after buffering your chicken until your
            opponent reverses the attack.
        
        3.  Your opponent must reverse the right kick attack from step 1.
            When they reverse your right kick, your character will chicken
            their reversal (i.e. reverse their reversal) and you'll hear the
            announcer yell "Chicken!"
        
        4.  After your character performs the chicken, watch him/ her to lower
            their arms and return to their normal fighting stance.  This 
            happens very quickly.  As soon as they do, perform your 
            character's specific back throw (see list above). Timing is very 
            important here.  Do not try to run up to the opponent to throw 
            them.  This is not necessary.
            Just execute the specific throw even though it appears as if your
            opponent is too far away to grab them.
            If everything was done correctly, you'll see your character
            magically appear behind your opponent and will execute a back 
            throw.  What's unusual about this is that your character will not 
            even be touching the opponent when they do the throw!


Tips For Playstation Tekken 3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        If you're practicing the Chicken Glitch Back Throws in practice mode,
        turn on the "Freeze Signal."  After you see your character perform a
        chicken, you'll notice that your character will be red (meaning that
        they cannot do anything at that moment) for a brief time.  Ideally,
        you will want to execute your character's specific throw at exactly the
        same time your character turns green.  If your timing is perfect, you
        will not even see your character turn green once you do the throw.
        Your character will then immediately proceed to do the Chicken Glitch
        Back-Throw on your opponent.
        An exception to this rule is for Gun Jack.  His Chicken Glitch Back-
        Throw is quite difficult to execute.  What you will need to do is, once

        you do his chicken, wait for an extremely tiny fraction of a second for
        Gun Jack to turn green before you do his specific back throw.  If you 
        do his throw at exactly the same time he is supposed to turn 
        green-meaning that he remains red (never turns green), and you see his
        throw grab animation come out but misses the opponent, you are doing 
        his throw too early.  Just delay it by a fraction of second to do his 
        back throw next time.
