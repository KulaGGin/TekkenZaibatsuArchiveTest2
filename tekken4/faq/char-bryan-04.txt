DISCLAIMER
----------
Its been said before, and I'll say it again: its a shame that people have to
include these notices to stop lazy bastards from stealing material never
intended for profit... but we do.  So:

All material in this FAQ (names and whatnot) is copyright of its respective
owners... mostly Namco.  The move information comes from www.tekkenzaibatsu.com
who is nice enough to provide it for free to the Tekken community.

All other information in this FAQ is (C) 2002 by Gerard Mainardi and is NEVER,
EVER TO BE USED FOR PROFIT.  Email me before putting this FAQ anywhere other
than Tekken Zaibatsu... I wont care, but email me first anyways.  I wrote this
to share my Bryan knowledge with other players and no one should make a
single penny off of the time and effort I put into writing this document.





WHY A BRYAN FAQ?
----------------
Yes, I realize that there are already 3 FAQs about Bryan on Zaibatsu.  So
why write another?  Well, a few reasons.  First, because I'm bored at work and
I felt like it.  Second, I love to play Bryan and figured why not share my
views of him with everyone.  Third, this is intended to help newer players get
better with Bryan.   Lastly... did I mention I'm bored at work?





ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT
-------------------
Bryans full movelist, without my comments in between each one, is at
http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/tekken4/move_bryan.php if you want it.
I am going to provide a breakdown of each move and some advice - it's 
why I wrote this!!!  If you need to know why I'm listing numbers 
instead of things like right punch, go to the bottom of this FAQ in
the glossary so you can learn the button conventions.  I didnt want to
waste space by putting what most people already know up here.
Your best bet you learn the basics of the game is to choose Tekken 4
from the main Zaibatsu page and look into the GAME SYSTEM section.
You will learn a LOT and you will understand how the game works.
Lastly, any corrections in this FAQ - just email me.  They'll be done.
OK... enough chatter... onto the meat.





WHY BRYAN?
----------
This FAQ was written for everyone but mostly for people who have played around
with him and want to take the next step into seriously learning him.  I've
named this FAQ Its About Time because it IS about time... that Bryan got some
respect!!!  In Tekken 4 he has really become a serious contender.  I don't care
what you've heard, Bryan can mix it up with the best of them this time around;
anyone who says otherwise has just never played against someone good with him.

STRENGTHS
=========
- Speed: Surely not the fastest character in the game but he ain't no slouch.
         He also has good dash capabilities and a fair sidestep; overall this
         means Bryan can be a mover, especially with his sway and "crouch dash."

- Power: Hell, this is what Bryan is known for!  There are few people in Tekken
         who can punish you as bad as this guy can.  Top 3 in terms of power.

- While Standing: Bryan has the most mixups of any character while rising from a
                  crouch.  Opponents will learn to fear it.  Period.

- Mixups: While not the BEST 'mixer' in the game, Bryan can play it well enough
          to whittle away at your life bar pretty quick.  Safe, quick strings.

- Punch Parry: They cant chicken it.  You have a follow up.  End of story.

WEAKNESSES
==========
- Lows: We all know this... the guy just doesnt have enough low attacks.  Dont
        get discouraged though.  This wont slow you down if you dont let it.

- Whiffs: Bryan's best power moves all leave you really open... play smart.




OVERVIEW: POSSIBLE WAYS TO PLAY BRYAN
=====================================
Here, we break down into the 3 different schools of Bryan-Style play:

- *GENERAL NOTE: Bryan is like a heavy car; its takes a second to get it up to
                 speed but once its going its hard to stop.  Be in control of
                 the match.  Once you work up momentum with Bryan you'll be just
                 tearing through your opposition.

- Bulldogs: I used to be a bulldog until I discovered Bryans dodging.  From the
            moment the announcer says fight you stay on your opponent like stink
            on rice (props to Sealab 2021 for that line).  Dont MINDLESSLY dog
            your opponent, simply throwing out attacks.  If you're playing well
            you've already calculated in your head everything you're using.
            Bryan has a problem with some characters (such as Ling who gets low
            a lot and Hwoarang who's a real mover) but if you're never giving
            them breathing room they don't have time to stop your momentum.

- Turtles: It is much harder to play Bryan this way, in my opinion.  While the
           overall strategy of waiting for your opponent to mess up then
           monopolizing on it is a tight one, Bryan is slow to get going, as I
           said before.  Still, I'm not you... play how you want!

- Dodgy: You didnt think Bryan could be a big dodger, did you?  This is kinda
         misleading, but what I mean is a lot of Bryans move have built in
         sidesteps, ducks or sways.  You never need to block, always attack.
         This is how I play Bryan now.

Think about which of these best describe your play while reading over the
moves... it'll give you a better idea of how you'll want to incorporate each
into your personal Bryan style.




THE MOVES
=========
I know this is what you've been waiting for anyway, so...
* I generally ordered these moves the way they are listed on Zaibatsu *
* However, his throws, lows and similar strings are grouped as I saw fit *
* While EVERY move Bryan has DOES have a use and a time, I've *ed my 
  favorites, the moves that WILL be your best friends when you get good *

Here is how I will list each one:
COMMAND
HIT RANGE (lined up with the command for easy reference)
NAME
COMMENTS & PROPERTIES
[SUGGESTED USAGE]



GENERAL MOVES AND STRINGS
=========================

3+4
 m
SPARK SPIN KICK
This isnt listed, and everything about it is the EXACT same as his normal 3
EXCEPT: 1) it does 10 more damage and 2) you cant start strings from it.
Again, its on Zaibatsu but not in the in-game movelist.
[If you're just throwing a 3 mid kick anyways, why not add 10 damage?]
[Throw this out in your poking when they're near the wall, since it  ]
[sends them flying backwards.                                        ]


d/f+1, 2
  m    m
DOUBLE BODY BLOW
A simple one two punch that walks you slightly forward as it hits.  If the
first hits the second is guaranteed.  It's a solid poke if you dont abuse it.
[This move is good to throw out once in a while to bring momentum away from  ]
[your opponent.  Its sometimes nice to use after a forward dash if they duck ]
[and if the first hits, the second one does too.                             ]


D/F+1, 1, 1, 1, 2
  m    m  m  m  m
* VULCAN CANNON *
This starts the same as the above but you can throw out several quick punches
before the big finishing one.  You can delay the input between all the 1's.
[Great when your opponent is stunned against the wall or when you see    ]
[them dashing in for a power hit.  But let me tell you two of the best   ]
[uses.  One is for get-up games.  Run over, stand right next to them and ]
[throw the first one or two... people will think you guessed wrong and   ]
[stand up.  Actually, you're just delaying the other hits... now throw em]
[out and finish it.  Its also nice to just throw one of these and pause, ]
[people tend to run in and you can finish it.  Also, as far as I know,   ]
[if you get one you get em all as long as you dont delay any.            ]


SS+1
 h
HEADHUNTER
Yeah, it hits high.  Still a great hit if you can land it.  It knocks players
into a great position for you to do some ground damage.
[This is a good move overall but easily ducked, so watch your use of it.     ]
[I tend to use this as a match starter.  You can wait a VERY LONG TIME after ]
[you actually sidestep before hitting the 1... so much so that it looks like ]
[the sidestep animation is over.  Right before the announcer says FIGHT, step]
[deep and wait a moment.  You'll then be able to throw out moves - hit the 1 ]
[and even though it looks like you're standing still, you'll throw this hit! ]
[Most people wont see it coming.                                             ]


SS+1~2
  m
CHEAP TRICK
This hits mid but is somewhat slower.  Good players tend to see this coming.
[This is hard to land against experienced fighters but again, you can use   ]
[it, delayed to start the match.  Creates a nice stun if you hit on counter;]
[follow it up with a Snake Edge for nice damage.  Very stylish.             ]


SS+2
 h
SHELL SHOCK
This is just another high hitting sidestep move.
[It seems to come out slower than the SS+1 so really, I dont use it much.]


(FC_d_N)+1+2
         m m
* HAMMER DRIVER *
This move TRACKS really well, unlike a lot of Bryans hits.  It also sways back
and AVOIDS some highs during the hit.  It IS two hits but the first only
connects if the opponent is VERY CLOSE.  Good against techrollers and bulldogs.
[Until recently I didnt truly appreciate this move.  Why is it good?  Its fast,]
[its strong, it leaves opponents face down on counter, and it ducks highs!     ]
[Also, you can do it from a crouch.  This move is perfect to punish anyone when]
[they throw out those first 1,2 jabs.  If you're ducking especially, simply    ]
[throw this out to dodge the punches and counter.  This is my new best friend. ]


f+1+2
  h
SIDE STEP ELBOW
A little sidestep comes with this move which is nice.  Its also fairly quick.
[Easily ducked, but it creates some nice blockstun and is useful in a few ]
[flashy juggles.  On a block you're almost certain to land a 1,4 afterward]
[and if you DO land it, you can juggle off of it.                         ]


1, 2
h  h
DOUBLE PUNCH
The standard one two punch everyone has.  This has some options out of it
which I will list next.
[Its 8 frames... cant argue with that.  Use it as an interrupt, a poke,]
[hell, this move is arguably one of the top ones in Bryans arsenal.    ]


1, 2, 1, 2   }
h  h  m  m   }
             }
1, 2, 1, 4   }
h  h  m  l   }
             }
1, 2, 3      }
h  h  l      }

These are the mixups out of the initial 1, 2 punches.  The whole 1,2,1,2
will go through on a counter IF you hold forward the entire time.
[You'll use these mixups a lot.  They're one of the best ways to chip away]
[your enemy's life bar.  1,2,3 has a specific rhythm to it, and people who]
[are good at low parries will love to call you on it.  If you know they're]
[just juicin' for it, throw out a mid, like d/f+2 or the d/f+1 string     ]
[instead... its almost the exact same delay as throwing the 3 wouldve been]
[and you'll shut em up.  Dont be shy with these combos.  These help make  ]
[the majority of Bryans offense.                                          ]


1~4
h h
PUNCH KICK CROSS
This is a great move... very fast, and both will hit if you get the first.
Use this whenever you need to counter or just plain poke em.  Has more options.
[SMACK SMACK.  Get em!]


1~4, 3, 3
h h  m  h
SOUTHERN CROSS
A great followup for the first two quickies.  Dont throw out that last 3 unless
you know its gonna land or you're juggling, because most people will duck it.
[The first 3 hits are the ones I use the most.  You can delay the start of the]
[3, 3 which is also nice.  Let em have it with this whole thing when you have ]
[em back against the wall, its nice.  This is also great for juggles.         ]


* * *
1~4 leads into the following moves.  If you want to do 1~4 into it, you dont
    need the initial b on the b+2.  Now on with the show.
* * *


b+2, 1, 2   or   b+2, 1, 4       (NOTE: You can use f+1 instead of 1 for a fake)
 h   h  h         h   h  m
DOOM KNUCKLE COMBOS
Yeah, I know every little variation has a different name but I'm not listing em.
These are slow to start but you have a LOT of options out of this and it has
really good damage as well.
[OK, heres the in-depth on these babies:                                       ]
[ These hits are delayable.  Giddyup.                                          ]
[ The first b+2 creates a stun on counter.                                     ]
[ The 1 will create a stun regardless, as long as it hits.                     ]
[ You can hit up or down after the 1 to do a sidestep in the middle of this    ]
[     combo.  You can then hit the 4 to finish it!  I tend not to do that,     ]
[     instead going right into a grab.  Most people are expecting hits and so  ]
[     they wont react quick enough to break the throw.  Works wonders.         ]
[ Like I said, this move set is slow to start up but can turn the tide in your ]
[ favor.  A lovely little number is b+2, 1, then b+2, 1, 4.  Mad damage.       ]


b, b+1
     m
* SNAKE SLAM *
Yeah baby!  This move has a nice guard break property to it and juggles if it
hits.  Slam em!
[I use this after a WS+3 on counter, or whenever I need some breathing space ]
[since it kills momentum.  People underestimate this move.  On block they    ]
[have a nice stun and 1,4 will catch afterwards 75% of the time.  I've begun ]
[to use this a LOT now since if you hold the second b of a backdash, you can ]
[delay the hell of this.  So after you dash out of the way of something, you ]
[can score a free juggle a LOT more than you probably think.                 ]


b+1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4
 m   m  m  m  m  m  m  m  m  m  m  m
GATLING RUSH
If you get it on counter it allllllllllll goes through.  This gets very fast
near the end and the last 1, 4 must be hit precisely for it to work.  Practice.
[A lot of Bryan players tell me they have no use for this.  Well, ya know what? ]
[I use it.  A lot.  Its fun!  Once you start this move you can just keep mashing]
[both punches and it works fine.  Its really hard to land a hit while you're    ]
[doing this.  I throw this after sidesteps sometime.  Learn to nail the last 4, ]
[since its the only way its safe if they block it all.                          ]


f+2, 1, 4
 h   m  M
* DOUBLE PUNCH TO KNEE * (forget the real name)
That capital M means the last hit gets GROUNDED opponents as well.
This is a TRUE combo string - if one hits they all hit, period.
[Notes:                                                                       ]
[After the last hit there is a delay while Bryan laughs.  Be aware; dont whiff]
[This is nice to use when you're right next to someone on the ground.  I start]
[throwing it out, and thinking I've stupidly whiffed they begin to get up,    ]
[only to eat the last 4 while they're rising.  Great to use after a sidestep  ]
[too.  Plus, it starts up pretty damn quickly.  A great addition to his moves.]


d/b+2
  m
* STOMACH LIFT *
Creates a short lift stun, mostly good for juggles.
[This is great for juggles as it floats em and moves you forward.  It also ]
[dodges some high hits and stops opponent momentum.  Lastly, it will catch ]
[and JUGGLE people rolling on the ground, and is great for popping up      ]
[Christie from her ground BS for a nice juggle.  Shut down Ling, too.      ]


d/f+2
  m
* VULCAN PUNCH *
Its fast.  Its great.  It creates a short stun.  Please, use this move.
[A great poke, possibly his best single hitter.  As I said before, good to]
[use after 1,2 instead of the 3 as a fake.  Really good range, too.       ]
[Theres not that much I can say here.  All I can tell you is to use this  ]
[and through experience you'll find all the right places.                 ]


qcb
 -
SWAY
Bryan sways back.  Excellent for quickly moving backwards, especially repeated
back sways before FIGHT is said to gain distance.  Dodges highs if timed well.
[You have to be pretty well spaced for it to dodge moves but it will do it.    ]
[Play around with it... its important to be a master of Bryans movement options]


qcb, 2
     h
CHIN SMASH
Yeah, it hits high even though it doesnt look it.  Ah well.  Still great.
[DONT use this every time you sway.  They'll expect it.  Of course, if you're]
[punishing a whiffed move then by all means throw it every time!             ]


f+3
 m
STOMACH KNEE
Its quick, its mid.  Creates a hunch stun.
[Hits crouchers.  If blocked, creates no disadvantage.  A solid hit.  Period.]
[I dont really use this but nice... well, occasionally in juggles I do.      ]


3, 2, 1, 2
m  m  m  m
* GATTLING RUSH *
A bunch o' mids that comes out with pretty fair quickness.  Its a safe move to
throw out if blocked and on counter everything but the last hit is guaranteed.
[I use this a LOT.  It may be his best string.  Remember that if you use his]
[3+4 kick you CANT go into this string though.  Use this in your mixups.    ]
[If they're blocking it all and you wanna be totally safe, the first 3 hits ]
[of it leave you 100% safe though it kills the guessing game.               ]


3, 2, 1, 4
m  m  m  l
* BRUCE SPECIAL *
Same as the above with a low ender.  Mix the two up for best results.  Careful,
people will parry the last low if they know its coming.  But hell, people will
parry any low if they know its coming.  Just dont be stupid, I guess!
[Mix it up, baby.  Let em have it.  Barrages of mixups work wonders.]


3, 3
m  h
* QUICK SPIN KICKS *
Nice kicks.  Both land on counter.  Fair speed.
[I use these a lot in my bulldogging.  Look at the bottom of this FAQ in the]
[strategy section for advice on where in bulldogging to use these.          ]


u+3 or u/f+3
     m
ROLLING DRIVER
Eh.  Its a high kick.
[I never use this.]


u/f+4
  m
* ORBITAL HEEL KICK *
This is GREAT.  Dont TOTALLY abuse it but man, this is one of my favorites.
It creates a sort of float juggle and hits mid.
[I use this move a LOT.  It creates a neat little juggle.  Sometimes I'll throw]
[this move out far away from someone to make them think I screwed up, then do  ]
[it again right away - by that time they're charging in to punish me and WHAM! ]
[The other great time for it is when you're running up to a downed opponent.   ]
[If you're charging in and they're getting up, almost 99% of the time they will]
[duck when they do.  BAM.  Juggled!  Also, if they try to throw a low get up   ]
[kick when you approach, they'll eat this move.  Really great after a sidestep ]
[too since its pretty quick.                                                   ]


b+3, 2, 1, 2
  h  h  m  m
BRUCE RUSH
Its slow to start but has its uses I guess.
[I dont really use this.  Ever.  The first b+3 is a big-ol'-boot-in-the-air ]
[kinda hit; its good to kick people out of jumping moves if you hit em early]


b+3, 2, 1, 4
  h  h  m  l
RUN FOR COVER
Low variation on the above.
[Bah.  1,2,1,4 is better in my opinion due to b+3's startup time.]


b+3, 4
  h  m
FRONT KICK TO KNEE
Most people dont expect this since people tend to throw out the longer combos.
Still, not that useful unless someone is running in to catch your after the b+3
[Again, I dont use this set of moves.]


b+4
 m
* ORBITAL KNEE *
This rocks.  Its fast and juggles crouching opponents!
[The juggling of crouchers is the primary use for this move.  A few quick notes:]
[This is nice to use as a get-up game sometimes as many people get up into a    ]
[crouch, anticipating a low hit.  Second, this will juggle Steve out of ANY of  ]
[his sways.  Great to use if Steve sways out of your punch parry.               ]


d/f+4
  m
WOLF BITE
A spin around mid hitter that leaves them sprawled out on the ground.
[I really dont use this much but its not a bad move.  Creates a neat little]
[guard stun type of thing and slightly turns the opponent if they block it.]
[I use this mostly as a get-up mixup when I run up to a downed opponent.   ]
[They're gonna eat this or a d/f+3.  Nice mixup; can really crush people.  ]


f+4, 3, 4
  h  m  h
* RUNNING BLIND *
You need that first forward as long as you do the 4, 3 quickly.
This move is nice; if the first 4 hits the 3 is guaranteed.
[On counter, the first hit of this (the standing 4) knocks the opponent into  ]
[the air.  If you do this whole string on a counter, the first AND LAST 4's   ]
[both hit, even though they dont look like they should.  This move is GREAT.  ]
[I throw the 4, 3 out CONSTANTLY, sometimes a few times in a row.  Great range]
[and speed!  Make this a sure part of your bulldog game.  Now, there is a     ]
[difference in 4 and f+4.  The f+4 recovers MUCH faster.  Fast enough that on ]
[a counter you can easily land f+4, ff+2 for a nice little combo.             ]


b, b+4
   h
ORBITAL FLIP DROP
Causes a nice guard break if you hit it.  Hits grounded guys if you can catch
em at the right moment but DONT use it as your ground-hitting tool.
[Its good against crouch-dashers or when people like ]
[Ling are down on the ground dodging your stuff.     ]
[People tend not to expect it, so its nice to throw  ]
[on people retreating since the range is gigantic.   ]


qcf
 -
CROUCH DASH
Bryan does a little dash forward.  This ducks highs in the late frames.
[This is a great movement/dodging tool IF you learn when in the dash he ]
[actually ducks attacks.  When doing this dash Bryan can whip out while-]
[standing moves.  If you hit a button right away after this motion the  ]
[move will come out almost instantly.  Definately not a real crouchdash ]
[since its not fast or chainable, but its a good movement/dodge tool.   ]


THE WHILE STANDING MOVES (You can substitute a crouch dash, qcf, for the WS)
========================
Note: For best play and quick attack, make sure you can do an...
Instant While Standing (iWS): This is done by hitting d, d/b VERY quickly.
                              It makes Tekken think that you're coming out of
                              a crouch and allows you to do While Standing moves
                              without the lengthy animation.  Master this.

WS+1
 m
SNAKE UPPER
Possibly Bryans best jugglestarter.  Hits mid.  On iWS, is DAMN quick.
[I use this a lot.  Follow it with 4,3,4 for nice damage for an easy combo.]
[I'm sure you can be more creative, but its solid.  This move is excellent.]


WS+2 (f+2 on hit for a throw)
 m
* GUT PUNCH *
If this hits, use f+2 right away to execute a great throw that juggles!
[This is kinda slow to come out, and best used to whack em if they're charging]
[you.  This is wonderful to hit jabbers with.  Crouchdash and pull this right ]
[away under a 1, 2.  It goes right under and leaves you with a huge damage    ]
[juggle.  Perfect when you're against a wall, as this juggle leaves them face ]
[to the wall.  1, 4, 3, 3 afterwards for huge unescapable wall damage.        ]


WS+3
 m
* HAMMER KNEE *
MY GOD I LOVE THIS MOVE!  I throw this out ALL the time in my bulldogging.  Its
quick, you recover well, and it creates a stun on counter.  If you're real fast,
you can throw out a b,b+1 or iWS+1 to juggle them.  I'm pretty sure if you're
quick enough you can also get a WS+2 with the f+2 as well for MASSIVE damage.
If you fail to do it quick enough they'll just get knocked away.  f,f+2 is fine
after this connects as well.
[How can you argue with this quality?!?!  HOW?]


WS+3, 4
   m  m
DOUBLE KNEES
You can follow the first knee with a second.  Good for some juggles.
[Aww yeeeeah.]


WS+4
  m
??????
Its fast and it has good range.  Even if blocked its fine, you're safe.
[Sure, why not.]


WS+1+2
  m
SHORT UPPER
Very fast, very weak.
[Use this only when you need to outspeed your opponent.]


WS+3+4
  h
RISE SPIN KICK
Its strong but it hits high.  Good if you're getting rushed, I guess.
[There are better WS options in my opinion.]


Crouch Dash into Chains of Misery
--THROW--
CHAINS OF MISERY
This is one of Bryans throws.  You CANNOT do a normal while standing for this.
It must be done out of his dash.  See the throw section for more info.
[AWESOME mixup from crouch dash, because CoM is obvious when you're just ducking.]


THE LOW ATTACKS
===============
Yeah, Bryan has very few low hits.  Here is what you DO have available.

d/f+3
 L
* SNAKE EDGE *
This is the biggy.  Somewhat slow but its your heavy hitter.  Has a lot of good
points: it hits grounded opponents and causes a float juggle.  It also recovers
crouching.  This means right after it you can do WS moves!
[In my opinion, d/f+3 into a WS+3, 4 is a great combo if you want something easy.]
[This move is wonderful as long as you dont abuse it and they dont see it coming ]
[every two seconds.  It ducks down so you can get under a 1, 2 if you know its   ]
[coming.  This doesnt always hit grounded opponents... I cant quite tell what    ]
[makes it work and what doesnt!  If you're off axis though, you have a much      ]
[better chance to make it work.                                                  ]


d+3
 l
LOW SHIN KICK
Doesnt hit grounded but its a good poke.
[Honestly, you just need to get a feel for when to use this one.  As soon as I]
[kill someone, I throw it out 3 times and say 'tappa tappa tappa'             ]
[Well, at least to my Simpsons-loving friends I do.  :)                       ]


d+4
 l
* LOW KICK *
This is his safest and quickest slow.
[Yeah, its crap damage but since every hit helps, poke away.]


d+3+4
 l
* THIN LOW KICK *
I love this one.  Quick and good range since he throws his closest foot out.
[I mix between this and d+4.  Its nice because of its range.]


Full Crouch + 3
 l
LOW KICK
This hits grounded opponents.
[I think I've used this move once.  If they're being a bitch though and]
[lying perfectly still for a long time, this'll let em have it.        ]



THE DASH MOVES
==============
These moves all come out of and can buffered into a f,f forward dash motion.

f, f+2
  h
* MACH BREAKER *
Bryans signature hit, if I had to pick one.  If you whiff, you're screwed.
[Awful recovery on this one.  Its best used to counter opponents who are]
[dashing in for a hit since it comes out blazing fast.  It has pretty   ]
[good range also, so if someone is dancing just outside of close range, ]
[you may be able to pop em one and surprise em with this.  It can be    ]
[pretty massively delayed after the dash, increasing range and being    ]
[good for a surprise.  This is great in juggles, custom strings... a lot]
[of the time!  Comes out a crouch very well.  A d/b+1, f,f+2 works great]
[because you pretty much go right from crouch to mach breaker.          ]


f, f+3 (can hold down 3 to delay this hit and increase damage)
  m
SLASH KICK
This is his only mid from f,f but its also slower than his other moves.
If you charge this all the way and its blocked they get side-turned.
[This is nice to use in your forward-dashing mixups.  Train people to duck ]
[by throwing mach breakers then let this rip to punish their crouching.    ]
[I often run up to a grounded opponent and whip this out with a giant delay]
[as sometimes they'll get up into it.  Wont work every time so be careful. ]


f, f+4
  h
* MACH KICK *
If they block this, the opponent recovers in a crouching block.  If this move
hit mid it would be godly as its VERY FAST... sadly, its high.  Dont whiff it
though, you'll likely eat a while standing move because they'll probably duck 
it, not block it.
[I mix this with the mach breaker.  It has it place in your attacks.   ]
[Just dont be stupid about it because you will get punished when they  ]
[duck.  The best part though is that this move has a built in sidestep!]
[After you sidestep throw this out for extra space.  It tracks fairly  ]
[well and you'll find yourself using it more and more.                 ]


f, f, f+3
    m
LEAPING SLASH KICK
A jumping kick out of a run.
[Everyone has something like this.  I honestly dont use it much.]



UNBLOCKABLES
============
Bryan has two unblockable attacks.  One is fairly useful while one is not.

f+1+4
* METEOR BLOW *
This is the "fast" version.  He leans back avoiding highs for a moment then
whips this out.  It does 21 damage and its fairly useful.
[Play around with this... you'll likely find a time to play this card.]
[Great to end matches with, and it dodges more than you'd guess!      ]

b+1+4
METEOR SMASH
This is the "slow" version.  He leans back longer, giving you a higher 'dodge'
window.  It does 60 damage and WILL hit grounded opponents.
[If someone is waiting and waiting to get up, try it.  If you're the perfect ]
[distance away, their panicked getup attack will miss you and you'll hit them]



* THE PARRY *
=============
b+1+2, followup with 2 if its successful
This is Bryan's punch parry and it WILL save your life and win you battles.
Time this with your opponents punch attack and follow up for an auto-beating.
He will throw a different hit depending on which opponent's arm he parried.
Beware... Steve can auto-dodge his mach breaker follow up by holding back when
it happens.  This also allows Steve to get a hit in!  Instead, dont follow up
and use the b+4 knee to juggle him.  A good mixup just for Steve.
Use this whenever you know your opponent is throwing out punches!
Kazuya and Hei's 1,1,2 and 1,2,2 string are great to parry, as are the godfists.
Stop some of Jin's cheap hits as well.

Of course, you may have to defend yourself from complainers.
They say: "You're so cheap, you parry all my punches."
You say: "You're so predictable, I parry all your punches.  Learn to play."

The defense when playing against this, of course, is to bait them into trying
a parry.  Dash in and pause a moment.  They'll parry and be frozen and open
while the parry animation runs.  Let em have it before they recover!


THE TAUNT
=========
1+3+4
This is Bryans taunt.  It does not damage but it DOES *HIT* IF YOU'RE *VERY* CLOSE
and its unblockable.  You can also cancel it at ANY TIME.  This taunt is useful for several reasons...

- Baiting: Throw out a taunt to make your opponent come charging in.  Then let
           em have it with a mach breaker or snake edge (f,f+2 or d/f+3)

- Juggles: Yes, you can juggle with this.  If you're quick you can cancel it
           into itself (1+3+4, f, 1+3+4) for double juggling action.  One of my
           favorite (not damaging but STYLISH) is WS+1, 1+3+4 cancel into f+1+4
           Its very hard to land at first but it does work.

Special moves!  Bryan can do a special taunt followed by special moves.
Do his normal 1+3+4 taunt then press and hold 1+4 again until the taunt is done.
IT DOES NOT LOOK ANY DIFFERENT FROM HIS NORMAL TAUNT but it IS a different move.
You can then do f+2,1,4 into 2, 1, 4, 2
                 h  m m      h  h  m  h

I use this a LOT.  Whenever the opponent is far away - say, after a f,f+2 is
landed or something - you'll have time to charge the combo up.  You have about
7 seconds that the combo will be available.  All you need to do is land the
VERY first f+2 and the WHOLE thing will go through.  If you get to the first 4
(the knee) and botch is though, or they block it, the charge is gone.  Anyways,
I use this all the time as its flashy and the damage is massive and guaranteed!



TEN HITTERS
===========
Bryan has 3 of them, and they all start the same way.  I dont use them because
frankly, they pretty much suck and people will block every hit of them anyway.
I'm not going to bother listing them, check his Zaibatsu movelist for them.



THROWS
======
Bryan isnt much of a thrower but hell, they're important.
Both his F+2+4 and his 2+4 have 2 as their escape.  Bah.

HOWEVER, his big number is Chains of Misery, a lovely throw with a 1+2 escape.

The command is done from a FULL CROUCH position:
d/f, d, d/f+1+2

This throw has good range and great damage.  Best off, you can use it out of
a crouch dash.  Simply do the crouch dash - now, the d/f and crouching parts
of the command are 'buffered' into the game already.  Simply do d, d/f+1+2 and
you'll whip out the throw out of the crouch dash.  Excellent for mixups.




MY STRATEGY
===========
Heres why you're reading this, right?  To see what I have to say here.
Well, 'ere goes...

I play Bryan has a bulldog most of the time with a strong countering game.  I
am not into turtling as I find it doesnt suit his style well.  Bryan is a power
player and I feel he should be used as such.

MATCH START
-----------
There are several things you can do here.
Jump over the opponent: This gives you a free backward 3 or 4 if you time it right.
                        Honestly I start 50% or more of my matches this way.
Start in a crouch/crouchdash: This starts you off with Bryan's most deadly
                              set of moves available - his while standing set.
                              Starting with Chains of Misery isnt a bad idea,
                              or with a WS+3 knee since its very fast.
Sidestep: I explained this earlier, but a deep sidestep right before they
          yell FIGHT will allow you to pull out a sidestep move the second
          the match allows attacks.  Check the SS+1 move for more info.
Sway backwards: Sway a lot to put some distance between you.  If the other
                person also backs up, charge right before they say fight and
                as soon as they DO say fight, you'll already be doing an
                unblockable charge!

IN-MATCH
--------
Bulldogging: As Bryan, I try to constantly be attacking my enemies so they dont
             have time to think and get momentum going against me.  I throw out
             series of quick, similar attacks that keeps them guarding,
             hopefully countering them if they try to counter ME.  For example:

             4, 3 --> 3 or 3, 3 --> 1~4, 3 --> 3+4 --> u/f+4 --> d/b+2
                                         or
             1~4 --> d/b+1 --> WS+3 --> 3, 3 --> iWS+3 --> iWS+3 --> 1, 1, 1

             1~4 --> d/b+1 --> f,f+2 --> SS into f,f+4 --> b,b+1 --> 1, 2, 1, 2

             3,2,1 --> 1,2,1 --> 3,2,1,4 --> 3,3 --> d+4 --> 1,2 --> d/f+2 --> 4,3

             Yes, they can duck some of those hits but the goal is to goad them
             into attempting to counter me.  With any luck, I'll still be
             throwing my own attacks then and counter THEM.

Jabbing: Constant jabbing with 1 is extremely annoying but effective if you're
         in close range.  Every time they start to do anything, pop em a quick
         one.  This also flusters them and makes them want to get some space,
         which you wont give them if you're constantly throwing out hits.

Spacing: 4,3 is great for spacing.  Keeps em back.  Vary it with the last 4.

Baiting: While ideally you'll bulldog someone so much they'll never have a
         moment, chances are you're going to get whacked a few times in a 
         match and the opponent will have some breathing room.  At this point,
         your goal is to GET BACK INTO MID/CLOSE RANGE.  At mid range use his
         kicks like 3+4 / 4,3 / 3,2,1 to move your way back to close range.

         At close range, a 1,2 will usually get the opponent ready to duck and
         counter, at which point 1+2 will sway out and smack them down.  1+2 is
         also great to use after a blocked 4,3 when the opponent is ready to rush
         in.  Hell, even another 4,3 will get em half of the time!

Corner Beating: Bryan is an EXCELLENT corner beater.  Push someone into a tight
                spot and commence with FAST, QUICK-RECOVERING hits in rapid
                succession.  Things like d/f+1, 1, 1, 1 and 1~4 or just constant
                1 jabs works great.  If they're blocking it all, push them back
                into the wall again to cause a stun from which you can beat em!

                Push --> 1,2 --> Push --> 1 --> Push --> 1 --> 1 --> Push --> etc.

Tricksy: Perhaps you've knocked your opponent down and far away.  Perhaps they
         have managed to get back despite your best efforts.  Whatever the case,
         you're far away - and you dont fight well from far away.  If you just
         cant seem to bait your way back into close range, you're gonna have to
         make them slip up.  Here are a few tricks I use:

         - Double kickin': Throw out an u/f+4 orbital heel kick and purposely
                           whiff it.  If you play your cards right they'll rush
                           in on you.  Do another one the second you land and
                           they'll eat it, giving you a free juggle.

         - The rush-in low: If you're a short distance away, run in as if you're
                            going to charge or throw out a f,f dash move.  The
                            second you get close, cancel the run into a d/f+3.
                            Most people wont expect a low and you'll juggle em.
                            The move has such range that it makes a nice mixup.

         - The rush-in throw: Same as the above but cancel into a sidestep
                              and throw the bastard!

         - Delayed f, f+3: Try rushing in with this but hold the kick as long as
                           you can.  They'll pause, expecting a hit, then get
                           ready to counter.  Thats when you unleash for a hit.

         - Stop: This can be risky if you're inexperienced, but sometimes if you
                 just do nothing at all your opponent will be confused for a
                 moment.  No telling how they'll react, but it can certainly
                 shake things up if nothing else.  Let em rush in and f,f+2 em!

         - Heel kick: Bait them into mid-long range and throw the b,b+4.  Whats
                      the worst that can happen?  If they block it the stun is long.
                      This lets you backroll, then jump forward with a flying cross chop.




IN CONCLUSION
=============
If you've never really gotten into Bryan before, I hope this has given you some
insight on how to get started.  Practice your juggles, work on your movement,
and good luck!  If this helped you, please drop me an email and tell me!

If you already use Bryan and read this for ideas, I hope you come away with a 
few.  If not, my apologies for wasting your time.  Be sure to drop me an email
and tell me.  I probably wont care.

WATCH MATCH VIDEOS to get ideas from good players.  I cant stress this enough.
Lastly, of course, there is no substitute for experience.  Go play.  A lot.
Cant wait for Bryan in Tekken 5 to see where Namco takes him.

THANKS
======
Castel, Catlord... all of the people who we all thank all the time,
                   for obvious reasons.

Medic... my sparring buddy, with whom I've wasted countless hours
         of my life playing Tekken.  44 to 44 at 4:44 AM was just scary.
         Also, Shababo and Pass need mention.  "Drunken tekken" always makes
         for a fun Wednesday night.  "Hungover work" is just as difficult.

Other FAQ writers... for inspiration, good advice, and taking the time
                     to pass on your knowledge.  Not enough people help
                     each other anymore.

Tekken players at University Pinball in Philadelphia.

The excellent people in Philly, for putting me in my place and making me
get better.  My Bryan got much better real fast when I played these guys.


ABOUT THE AUTHOR:
=================
All the crap you dont care about but I'll tell you anyway
---------------------------------------------------------
I'm currently (1/04) a computer science student at Drexel University in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  I'll graduate in 2005 and hopefully end up
making games for a living.

I'll admit that I didnt get into Tekken on the ground floor... I was never
exposed to the game until Tekken 3 (props to Sce).  I started playing and
in about 30 minutes I realized Tekken was better than crack.  I've been
hooked ever since.  Originally I was a Jin player (who wasnt, really)
but once I started playing Bryan it was like... I dunno... ultra-crack.
Of course as a hobby I'm always working on learning every character...

I'll be heading over University Pinball on UPenn's campus a bunch when
Tekken 5 eventually comes out.  I'm 6' 0", thin, wear a lot of surf clothing
and almost always play Bryan or Heihachi.  If you're going to ask if its me,
my name is (despite the spelling) pronounced JERID.

Live in Philadelphia and wanna play?  Drop me an email (skkra@drexel.edu)
or IM Skkra... always looking for competition.

I dont claim to be the best Tekken player in the world - I'm most likely
not - but I love the game, Tekken theory and Bryan Fury, so I wrote this
FAQ.  Hope you enjoyed it.  This is where it ends.  Stop reading now.  Stop!
