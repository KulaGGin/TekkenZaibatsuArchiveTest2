My say about Kazuya 
=======[!?]========

He is one of the strongest players in tekken 4 because of his move 
now is more faster than T2 or even TTT but his WGF is now like jin's 
WGF because if the opponent crouch Kazuya's WGF will just hit air.
I don’t know why they say Kazuya is a weak player or anything. I know
his moves reaction time is slow than Heihachi and Jin. But for me 
he [I don’t want to say strong cause tekken is a well balance game] 
a very reliable character to kick your ---TOOOT---  

=====[!?]===== 
Kazuya's story
=====[!?]=====

Kazuya is the son of Hiehachi Mishima a rich man with a big company
called "Mishima zaibatsu" Heihatchi believe that to be strong must 
have anger in heart so Kazuya was thrown in the cliff and leave
a large scar in his cheats. Then when he grow older he sold his soul
to the devil and became more powerful so he beat his father in the 
first King of the Iron Fist Tournament then he was the C.D.O of the 
Mishima zaibatsu and 2 years later he organize another tournament but
he lost to Heihachi and thrown to the volcano. 20 years has pass when 
the 2nd tournament. The G company revive Kazuya. Kazuya want to have
the devil gene so that he can defeat his Father ones more and get 
everything BACK . Heihachi learn that Kazuya was dead and his corps
is in the G company and raid it and then Heihachi saw Kazuya alive
and fight with the tekken force and entering the tournament even it is 
a trap.

that, a gut punch can stun opponent on counter hit while Kazuya's gut punch
can stun opponent on counter hit and if you stand at the opponent in a non to
close distance you'll stun them. Its use are for throws, special moves, combos
and juggles.
Rate ****

section of the opponents body. Its easy to block and if block at the hellsweep 
part on this combo it will just make kazuya open of a juggle. NOT RECOMENDED
Rate *

useless, but it is pretty useful. If it hits the opponent it will just do a

Some moves are coming soon!!!

========[!?]=========
Strategy for computer 
========[!?]=========

When I play to the computer I usually wait for an open attack this is 
the characters
[some of them are coming soon OK]

Paul 

when he do his Phoenix smasher "QCF 2" you know just side step or is hit 
do the Tumble Knockback Recovery "B" then if he attack just block and KNOW 
his 10 hit combos so that after that you cant WGF him and juggle his

Xiaoyu

She usually do his Phoenix stance and do some attack so I usually do is to 
wait for her to attack and do a juggle or hellsweep if don’t be fool by her
stance cause it can kill you

Yoshimitsu

he do the move "3,3" in tekken 3 its only "3,3" now its "3,4" its very trick
specially I have a bad arcade days and just this move can kill me
then do the "d,3+4"its cant do a combo like in tekken tag

Steve 

his like Hworang but only hands not feet do you know wat I mean so I usually do
is to also find an open and do kazuya fast move like Shinning fist "1,1,2"
because Steve has fast hands and can kill a slow reaction players

Christie

She is just like Eddy in tekken 3 all of her moves are in front side steps 
for her is only in little so just block up and down and she is no as fast as
eddy k

Hwowarang

This Taekwando Student of Baek has already Baek's moves like the chop and some
kick are like in Steve that can hurt people bay punching and hwoarang by kicking
so I advise that if he kick you block and use like in Steve Kazuya's fast
moves so that you can win

King 

king now is like a wwf wrestler so if he grapple you with his multiple grapple
just crouch because it he cannot grab you then use kazuya's gut punch or twin
piston then a kick for a juggle king usually do is his ten hit combo so block
and if there is a opportunity take it

Law

his moves are like Forest law in tekken 3 and the Strategy of the AI is like 
also in tekken 3 but little more smarter he do is his somersault but some times
he jugs like a human I don’t know why so I do is if he do the "d,3+4"thing then
when he gets up do is I WGF him then 1,WGF law is also fast so be careful :)

Craig

He has King's SS but instead of a grab he just smash you and he has also mount
punch so I do is wait for an opportunity and go for it the vale tudo stance
of Craig is still little unknown for me because i did not see all Craig’s 
moves[wait for the update OK]

Jin

His a LOT different in Tekken 3 and Tag and his style of being the fastest in
Tekken is change. He now a Powerful Character so if he do his Laser Canon and
Wind Hook Fist I don’t know if right name of that launcher just block cause 
computer know already juggles and he is powerful so do be careless his combo 
like the Blazing Fire Demon Rush is more powerful than Kazuya's and if hit you'll
be paralyze then hit some more. That  -TOOOOOOOOOT-

Violet

Yes Violet or Lee whatever he uses his kick all the time like his D,4,4,4,4,4 its
very hard to block his move cause his move is not quite strong damage singlely but
and he do is like Paul's f,f,3,4 its some time hits me and he is very aggressive
computer I don’t know y but his reaction time is fast after a move another move was
executed so I use my eyes to block and wait for a little opening as I said that his 
reaction was fast so I use Shining Fist or just 1,1 then WGF [not connected but
a fake to the comp.

Some other character are coming soon ^_^

===========[!?]=============  
Strategy for an human opponent
===========[!?]=============

[REMEMBER this do not let the opponent gut you cornered]

Paul

human's also do the Phoenix smasher to there opponent and the WS 2 and do a juggle
with a ten hit string watch out for this moves computer are dumb but humans don’t
and if use the Phoenix smasher just sidestep if hit by accident move our joy stick 
back so that you be up with our knees

Xiaoyu

the strategy of human player for now is like in Tekken tag so while she is back 
she can kick you and go with a juggles and she is small so when she do the Phoenix
stance then wait for her move I had a mistake that when she do the Phoenix Stance 
I do the WGF she attack me and boom I was damage and the advantage wag hers but I 
win because I got her by my Tsunami kick I thought I was a goner

Hwoarang 

human players just do is his kick then the sky rocket so my advice is just wait for 
his moves and attack you must be patient cause little carelessness can go with a 
disaster
sorry because this is only characters that I had a fight on wait for my updated version

Credit/final words

some of the info is still not complete because of lack of players playing different
character here so some are coming soon  hope you'll wait and I hope help you 
by giving this guide. Hey this guide is for guides but if you want to be a very
good player in Tekken just practices even if you are studying just have time I know 
you can do it so any question just email me at Kazuya_ttt@yahoo.com. If you did not
appreciate my cause "its a joke" or "What’s this player so SIMPLE no Fancy juggles or 
any thing?" or "Im a Tekken god" hmmm... I play Tekken cause of its great gameplay
and cool graphics or moves. I don’t laugh people who are a bad player Because they 
play not for glory and honor [Karate kid...] they have fun playing it and sometimes
addicted to it. So please if you find my faq just a joke you are mean and forget 
what your main objective of playing it. For new players or having hard time on 
Kazuya I hope my Faq help you. Thank you ^_^   

Sorry its not yet complited cause I had to do something eles. Just wait for my
