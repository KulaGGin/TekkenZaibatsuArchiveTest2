/I. Introduction /
*****************

	Hi my name is Tseng and ive been playing tekken for quite a long time now [since
tekken2 maybee]. I live in QuezonCity , Phillipines , play in SM north,Quantum Arcade 
Oviously my favorite character in Tekken is Xiaoyu. Why? She has great speed,high 
priority moves and good evasion moves.And she has two taunts that i love to use.
And besides not many people use Xiaoyu which makes her an over-looked character. 
Ive been using her since tekken3 and i only learned her true potential in Tekken
Tag. But in using Xiaoyu, expect to lose in some matches when using her. AHH... 
well heres the moves..... :

| II. Xiaoyu's Story |
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

	Ling was a junior at Mishima High School. She still lived, studied 
and trained as a ward of the Mishima Zaibatsu. But lacking any particular 
goals, Ling grew tired of her everyday routines. 
	However, one day, she received an anonymous e-mail that warned her of 
Heihachi’s evil intentions and the danger to her life. Ling replied to 
the e-mail, but she did not receive any further messages from the anonymous 
individual.
	Ling’s intuition told her that Jin, who had been missing since the last 
Tournament, could have sent the message. She believed the message and started 
to suspect Heihachi and the Mishima Zaibatsu. 
	Upon hearing the announcement of the next Tournament, Ling made the 
decision to enter , hoping to be reunited with Jin and to unveil the truth behind 
Heihachi and the Mishima Zaibatsu.

******************************
| IV.Move Analysis and tips |
******************************
note: This is a very long list of moves that i analyized.
i did not bother adding some of the moves that dont make
too much significance in other matches, ill probably add them in the
next updates.

-Grappling Techniques-

2+4		360 degree flip
Ling takes the opponents arms and flips em over to the floor.
A quick okizeme is guaranteed. like d+3 or d/b+4. Or a d+4 
if her or she tries to get up.

F+2+4       Slap, Forearm Chop
Ling takes the opponent by the arm and slaps them back acrost 
the face, and then from the back, into the ground.

HCB+2     	Wristlock Flip
Ling grabs the opponent by the arm then pulls em to the ground
ends in FaceUp/FeetAway. A quick okizeme is guaranteed. like
d+3 or d/b+4. Or a d+4 if her or she tries to get up.

f+2~1		Human hurdle
Ling walks over the opponent and leave you and your opponent
with backs turned,i think the guys in namco decided to increase the
damage of this move in tekken 4[in my own observation] its as strong
as a 1-2 punch.

FC,d/f+2+4_2+4~D/F Shoulder Flip
Xiaoyu's only new move (besides the position switches DUH!).Ling turns her
back against the opponent and pulls his/her head and flips em above her
shoulder to the ground. opponent will end up Faceup/Feetaway. this has
good damage.


-Special Techniques-

1,2>1         Double jabs, Storming flower
a basic 1-2 punch that both hits high, it is followed by a storming flower
one of Ling's primary moves, you can add a sight delay after the second jab.
the storming flower is guaranteed even if the first jab counterhits.
Once the storming flower is blocked it leaves you in a safe distance.
This string is good for poking. but 1,2 it self is a very good move
in close range. You can mix up the storming flower with a grab or a quick
low attack.

1,d+2,1+2_~f  Jab,Uppercut, Bird flock_face forward
one of ling's old two hit strings but the diffrence is namco added xiaoyu's bird
flock as an extension in this move. like her 1,2 , her 1,d+2 is exellent for 
poking and for those people that keeps ducking your high attacks. after 1,d+2
you have 3 choices of moves weather to stop in backturned postion,to end in facing
forward or fire the bird flock.1,d+2,1+2 is a good juggle follow-up after her
d/f+2~1.

b+1_2[~hold b]	Knife Hand Reversal [face forward]
ling's counter move. after this move hits ling automatically enters her backturned
postion [unless you hold forward,in doing so you'll stay in face forward]
has good recovery. but i do not recomend this move, but dont be shy to throw in some
of this on opponents that keeps charging up towards you.I use this in wall combos
and before staring a round [after the announcer says "FIGHT !!"]

d/b+1		 Storming flower
Xiaoyu's primary weapon ! her version of paul's phoenix smasher. This has good recovery
when blocked, but expect to get hurt when this misses. After making this move hit, the 
opponent will fly off on the other side of the screen.But expect the opponent rolling far
after making this move hit as a counter hit, xiaoyu will even do her horizon taunt after
that....tsk,tsk,tsk..... Use this move after blocking you opponents slow recovering move,
or even push you opponent to the wall.This is also good as a juggle ender because it gives
good damage even when your opponent is up in the air.

d/f+1[~d/f]	  Turning palm [face forward]
one of xiaoyu's fastest ways to enter her backturned stance. Also good for poking and 
juggling. holding d/f will cause not to enter her backturned stance but rather stay facing
forward.A good follow-up is a basic low jab(d+1).This is also good for pushing your 
opponent in a safe distance to setup your next attack.

1+2		   Bird flock
a good alternative for the storming flower.After landing this move you opponent is open
for a fast okizeme move like her racoon sweep (f,f+3) or her Demon flip (4~3). Good for
those people who keeps side stepping beacuse of the fact that this move tracks.

f,f+1+2~1+2    Wing strikes[X marks the spot]
stronger than d/b+1, good for retaliating after the opponent uses a slow recovering move.
This move causes block stun when blocked.Another good juggle ender. Another good feature 
about this move is that if the last 1+2 hits as a counterhit the opponent bounces up 
leaving him/her open for a quick juggle.

u+1+2 ~3+4_2>1  Overhead Slaps, Spin cancel _ Midpunch,Storming Flower
Well, u+1+2 itself recovers crouching. After that you have several options to choose from.
either go into FC or WS[following up WS or FC moves], Do a ~3+4 or do the 2>1 combo.
after u+1+2 then going into FC you can oviously do her WS and FC moves [like WS+4 or
FC,d/b+3+4] this has good recovery when blocked or if it hits. Then comes the u+1+2~3+4
that autosidesteps to ling's right and recovers very fast, has guard stun properties and
puts your opponent on the floor [FaceDown/FeetAway] after a counterhit, you can follow up 
quick okizeme moves like d/b+4,ss+4 or d+3 after CH u+1+2~3+4. Lastly a u+1+2,2>1...
This move is composed of her Initial Overhead Slaps then followed by her Midpunch,Storming
Flower combo..The last two hits is delayable and both hits mid.A good[or maybee bad] property
of this move is if the u+1+2 hits as a CH... the opponent will get thrown away after the 
second hit, then the storming flower wont hit. But doing this entire combo when your oppoent
is cornered is guaranteed bacause of the Midpunch causes wallstun after a counter hit.
Another way to use this is against an opponent that is facing backward.. this combo
is guaranteed [aslong as it does not counterhit]

2,1[~f]	    Jab, Palmslap [face forward]
another fast recovering 2hit string thats hits high,mid and ends in back turned position
(unless you hold forward to keep her facing forward).this is one of xiaoyu's good if not the
best poking strings. a good follow up is a lowjab (d+1). i think you can use this one
for your juggles (i havent tried this in juggling on tekken4...)

d/f+2~1         Twin Lifting Palms 
one of Xiaoyu's lauchers while facing forward that does not need to counter hit in order to 
juggle. has good recovery ,good damage and causes a short block stun. xiaoyu lifts her
opponent up in the air and flips him/her facing down and head towards in the air, limited
juggles can be done with this move but still it is a good juggle starter for xiaoyu.
Also good for hitting grounded opponents.

WS+2		    Rising slap
another juggle starter from the facing forward postion that ends in Backturned.but in order
to juggle your opponent this move has to counterhit. In tekken 4 you can hold the 2 to juggle
the opponent with out needing this move to counterhit, the diffrence is if you hold the 2
the risingslap rises slower that it normally does but it still has good recovery and its sure
to juggle your opponent.I really like this move !!!

FC,df+2 ~df_~1 ,[~df]  Lotus Twist, BT_Lotus Slap ,[BT]
A very deciving move that recovers very fast. after the FC,df+2 , its either you continue to
the next hit which is Lotus slap OR recover in BT position followed by a basic throw or a
back turned move (e.i. BT+4 , d+3).But after the Lotus slap you can also hold the df to do
the same process but the difference is the last ~d/f has auto sidestep properties .
FC,df+2~1 both hit Sm(special mid) i think this is STILL good for juggling. but im sure this
is one of xiaoyu's best poking weapons.

f,f+2>1		Midpunch, storming flower
one of xiaoyu's new moves (extracted from her u+1+2,2>1). this is very good for ending juggles
and even poking. good follow-up after the opponent hits the wall.it also hits opponents that
roll away or towards you. f,f+2 it self recovers fast and is a very versitile move.

f,f+3            Racoon kick
one of xiaoyu's most used moves. Has very good recovery and decent damage, this move hits
grounded opponents and it ends in BT posistion. Another great feature about this move is that
if this move hits as a CH, the opponent turns sideways towards his/her left, leaving that
unfortunate someone open (for a shorttime) for a backturned move from xiaoyu like BT 4 or
a BT d+3. in my opinion this is one of xiaoyu's best move [back in tag].

FC 3,2 ,1>4       Sweep,back hand, Lifting Flurry
one of xiaoyu's standard laucher string, problem is back in tekken3 and Tag when the FC 3 
hits as a counterhit, the next 3 hits are all guaranteed. but in tekken 4 once you connect
a CH FC 3 only the backhand is guaranteed to hit.You need to make 1 hit in order to lift 
your victim up in the air. FC 3,2 it self is a very good poking tool and this too has fast
recovery and this ends in backturned ( good follow ups are a basic grab or BT 4). FC 3,2,1
recovers facing forward and this also has very fast recovery.

4~3 [~d+1+2]		Demon Flip [Phoenix stance]
This is the best addition to xiaoyu's arsenal of moves !! i give it 9/10 !! xiaoyu flips
then lands on the floor in a sitting-like position that hits Mid. This move is basically 
an okizeme move that has pretty much strong damage when you land on your opponent.
xiaoyu recovers in FC after performing this or you can recover in phoenix stance by 
pressing d+1+2. Hitting standing opponents with Ch 4~3 make them float meaning you can
pull off a quick FC or WS juggles like WS 4 or FC 3,2. i think CH 4~3, d+1+2 , 3+4
works but i have not yet tested it.Unfortunately 4~3,d+1+2 does NOT hit grounded or
rolling opponents.

d/b+3 or BT d+4           Offensive Shove
This move does 0 damage but it is not a worthless move like most people think. This
guard stuns your opponent ( but not long enough to guarantee any move) leaving you
a faster recovery than your opponent, you can land good priority moves if he/she tries
to retaliate with their own moves.Another good thing about this move is it picks up
floating opponents,opponents that tries to get up or opponents that has fallen off
from the wall. examples are : ws+4 , f,f d/b+3 , 1 , f,f+2>1 . Good follow ups for this
move [if opponent is standing] are : d/f+3 , d/b+1 , d/b+4

d+3,4               Low sweep, High roundhouse
another good addition to xiaoyu's moves....... this move is also good for picking up 
opponents that tries to get up.This is a good okizeme move. d+3 itself is very good 
for poking, you can follow up some moves after d+3 like d/f+2~1 ,b+1_2 , d/b+1 or 
another d+3 heheh...

3			Power Cresent
This is like xiaoyu's old f+3 but this version does not step forward however this 
move is short range!! this hits high and has slow recovery rate. the good thing 
about this is when this hits the opponent get thrown away landing FU/FA making 
the 4~3 sure to hit !! this move has great damage and has tracking properties.
i use this against Hwoarangs that keep using their flamingo sidesteps.I was 
recently experimenting with this and its also good for poking and interupting 
attacks.. it also evades some of the opponent's moves. 3 is safer then f+3
when they are blocked.

f+3			Advancing Power Cresent
This is xiaoyu's old moves. like her basic 3 but the difference is that this 
advances forward and has greater damage.it has the same properties as 3 but
has slower recovery rate when blocked. f+3 has less evation properties though..
but still a good move to throw around once in a while...

SS+4             Wang Sweep
Straight from uncle Wang's Movelist , this is now one of xiaoyu's Best moves. this
hits low and recovers crouching, this also has good range. a CH SS+4 can make your 
opponent float leaving him/her open for a quick juggle like WS+2, 2,2,2.....
abuse this and you will have good results. This move ducks high and some mid and
has sidestep properties making it even more useful. SS+4 comes out very fast and
does 16 damage..

f,f+4~4 [d+1+2]	Lunging kick, blocked kickoff, [Phoenix stance]
xiaoyu lunges her right leg forward towards the enemys torso. This hits mid and has
very strong damage. Firing time is pretty slow so you need to use this move from
mid to far range.This move also evades some low moves. Another new thing about this 
move is that when the lunging kick is blocked you can flip safly away from the opponent
giving you enough space to prepare your next attack, after getting blocked you can choose
wether or not to go into phoenix stance or not.Dont be shy to throw some of this in
some of your matches , because this catches many people.

FC,d/b+3+4         Crouching Backturn
One of xiaoyu's best evasion moves. She does a 180 degree spin towards the left and this
auto-sidesteps towards the left all done while in a crouching position. This has a very 
fast recovery rate and this ends in BT postion. xiaoyu is very unpredictable after doing
this move, you have several options to choose from like : BT 4 , 2+4 or Phoenix stance.

u/b_u_u/f+3[~d+1+2] Piroette kick [Phoenix stance]
this was originally Xiaoyu's move from Phoenix stance, now it can be done without entering
phoenix stance. Xiaoyu hops evading low hits and slices the opponent's head, the opponent
will get knocked down after getting hit, and again he/she is open for an okizeme move.
you can recover in phoenix stance after doing this move.

d/b+4			Knee cap kick
Good for hitting grounded opponents.Recovery is a bit slow, This has some good properties.
d/b+4 comes out fast and hits low, a clean hit would cause a quick backward stun and the
best part.... CH d/b+4 puts the opponent on the floor, FaceDown/FeetAway. They say 
CH d/b+4 , d/b+3 juggles but i think the opponent must move in order for the Offensive
shove to hit(d/b+3).

u_uf+4[~1+2]		Overhead Kick [Phoenix stance]
this too evades low ,this move gives a good amount of damage.Xiaoyu hops and hit her
opponent's head in a downward motion.This move Floats in CH, and can be followed with
FC+3,2 or d+3~4 or a phoenix stance.

WS+4				Skyscraper kick
a very very fast move !! has very fast recovery and has decent damage !! Good for poking
and adding to mix-ups.a d+3 is sure to hit after your opponent gets hit.After the opponent
blocks this you are very safe because besides the fact that this recovers fast,this also
pushes the opponent away from you to a safe distance.Use this move often , i give this 
move a 9/10 !

4				Lifting foot
Xiaoyu's new laucher, this is a slow move and i dont actually recommend it. but it does
juggle on Counter hit only making it harder to use. Another this is this move is 
super short range....another disadvantage is it hits high.I think this has good
priority over some moves.

d+1+2				PHOENIX STANCE
Xiaoyu's signature position, the Phoneix stance has a lot of direct moves where in
you can knock your opponent down where ever you decide to attack , either High,mid
or low. This has lauchers for juggling and low hits that knocks the opponent down.
The best thing is that this move evades High and some mid attacks.You can move
Forward or backward or even hop which makes Xiaoyu very confusing.

f+1+2				Clockwise cartwheel
xiaoyu does a front cartwheel.This move auto sidesteps to xiaoyu's left. this move ends
in BT if youre up-close or mid/close to your opponent, from far this ends in FaceForward 
position.This move also has evasion properties meaning you can dodge some of your opponents
moves.I use this a lot and it gives me good advantage when the opponent misses me with
his/her attack.

b+1+2 			Clockwise circle walk
also known as the Hypnotist stance,this is a stance that Autosidesteps to the left. you 
can cancel this move anytime.Xiaoyu is considered standing and you can do  ANY basic 
moves like 1,2 or d/b+2. This stance has two additional moves:
	2  -  spinstrike = like xiaoyu's storming flower but this looks better.xiaoyu
				turns around and does thrustpunches the opponent, this move
				move has a slight left SS before realeasing this move evading
				more attacks.
	1+2-  powerspinstrike = Xiaoyu's unblockable move you can cancel this move with b,b
				but only when you press 1+2 immediatly after b+1+2, in doing so
				would result to xiaoyu back turned.
note: the longer you let xiaoyu walk or the more time you wait to fire these two moves,
	the stronger these two moves become.

this is my favorite auto sidestep move because you can cancel b+1+2 and do triple or 
double sidestep with this.Like SideStepLeft,b+1+2,SidestepLeft.

3+4 and d+3+4		Axis spin
another auto sidestep move, the difference is 3+4 sidesteps away from the screen while
d+3+4 sidesteps away from the screen.It is very important to know which one is which so
that you wont end up in-front of your opponent.Use this a lot too.

f+3+4			Counter-Clockwise Dive
i dont throw out this move too much. but it does evade some low and some straight moves.
this move auto ss to xiaoyu's right.

b+3+4			Small Step Counter-Clockwise
another fast way to enter BT position. Has good recovery and good evasion power.auto SS
to xiaoyu's right.a good setup and follow-up for this is sidestepright. So thats...
ssr, b+3+4 ,ssr   this TACTIC is also called Triple sidestep, and this tactic ends in
BT position.usually if this is executed correctly you'll end up behind or beside the
opponent.Execute it wrongly you'll end up in-front hehehe. Use this a lot !!! and i mean
A LOT !! i give this move a 10/10

f,f+3+4 or BT f,f+3+4	Overhead flip
the best way to get close to your opponent. Recovery is very very good, this hits
grounded opponents then guarantees a d+3 when it hits[i think]. After landing this
as a counterhit i think a basic grab is STILL guaranteed!!
this move can be also done while in back turned position.and landing directly above
the opponent would result in a grab that gives strong damage.
This move ends in Backtured or facingforward depending your distance from your opponent.

1+3+4              Horizon Taunt
my favorite taunt,you can cancel this move any time. think twice before using this 
during the game for many reasons:
	-you are open during this move
	-this has no damage
	-this is Irritating
	-you could leave the arcade with a blackeye,a bruise,a bloody wound,etc hehe

or u could use this to fake opponents.*somehow*. against the computer, they will not
attack while ur doing this[unless they're pretty close to you].

2+3+4               Waving Taunt
this actually does 0 damage.like Horizon taunt you can cancel this anytime with any
move.i have tried using this in wall combos and it worked.


-Back Turned Techniques [BT]-

1			Reverse elbow
a new xiaoyu move,it comes out fast, ducks some high attacks cannot be countered 
and hits mid. Xiaoyu ends in BT after this move allowing to follow another move. 
CH BT 1 stuns opponents and a BT 4 is guaranteed !! This move has slow recovery.

d+1_2			low punch
this is a punch that hits LOW not special mid. Very good as a poking weapon and should be
used often.This move ends in WS . this low punch has good speed and recovery. Very good
attack specially when a wall is behind the opponent.

f,f+(1+3)_(2+4)  	 Reverse Dash Grab
a cool looking move, xiaoyu does 2 steps towards the opponent and waves her arms then grabs
the opponent.this move evades some low attacks and is best used from Mid or Far range.
 
2			Backhand
a high punch that recovers fast and recovers in BT postion.Good for poking.Do not abuse when
opponent is NOT in the air ! pretty useful in some situations.

2, 1>4		Backhand,Lifting flurry
a h,h,m attack. you end in BT position after 2, after 1 you end face forward then you can
delay the last kick that juggles when hit.I think this combination was toned down.
the 4 is not guaranteed when the BT CH 2 ,1 hits.

3			Horse Kickout,Forward tumble
a short range move.not that useless but this is good in close range,knocks down opponents
when hit.Pushes away opponents to safe distance.Evades some high moves. and This move
ends in BT position.I this move is very good for pushing opponents towards the wall.
I alos use this after the opponent hits the wall and falls forward. a good setup for
this is u+1 then BT 3 .


f+3			Turning High kick
a basic backtured kick.Has good speed and damage that knocks the opponent down. Very good
for ending juggles or retaliating after opponent does a slow recovering move.

d+3			Reverse ankle kick
a good low attack from BT position. not easily blocked because it comes out fast. 
recovery is a bit slow. opponent ends in FD/FA after landing this move as a CH which
is best followed by an okizeme move.

f,f+3			Skip mid kick
a fast mid kick and has good priority.ends in BT. Knocks away opponents that get hit.

4 			Reverse hook kick
xiaoyu's standard juggle starter from the BT position. comes out fast and has fair
recovery. good for opponents that keep crouching.Hitting your opponents back will
not juggle though but will only flip him/her landing face first on the ground,you
can follow up with 4~3.[you need to CH in order to juggle him/her while he/she is 
backturned].

b,N~3+4            Backturned Axis spin away
an axis move that lets xiaoyu spin away from the enemy.ends in BT position.
this is an old move, but the new thing about this is the command is different,
the old one is BT u+3+4, but in tekken4 is different.THIS IS HARDER TO ABUSE!!

f+3+4               Roll Towards Opponent
a forward roll.use this if u want to get close to your opponent .This ends in BT
so it is followed with a good mix-up like a basic backturned grab or a BT 4.

f+3+4 ~3+4		 Kangaroo Kick
a forward roll which is followed by a pair of shoes to his/her face that juggles.
This move too ends in back turned.This move has a lot of juggle variations.
The kangaroo kick evades high moves and some mid. Xiaoyu did not learn this
from Roger.


-Phoenix Stance  [d+1+2/FC d+1+2]-


d		Phoenix Duck
this is the phoenix stance's crouch move. she can evade more moves while doing this
move.she can only crouch for less than a second then returns to the normal phoenix stance
position.

u		Stand up
cancels the phoenix stance without doing anything special. ends in FC

2>1		Hard stomach strike, storming flower
a very good move if u want to attack the opponent from below. Evades high and some mid
attacks. the first punch recovers FC. A CH 2>1 is guaranteed.comes out fast and 
has good recovery.The initial punch hits and tracks techrolling opponents then knocks
them for extra damage,the next punch is *I THINK* guaranteed as a juggle.

1+2		Phoenix Uppercut
A good juggle starter from the phoenix stance you can pull out some basic follow ups.
recovery is rather slow but comes out fast.

d+1+2		Power Uppercut
stronger and launches higher the Phoenix Uppercut,you can follow up more complex
followups and harder[but cool looking] juggles. I prefer this over Phoenix uppercut.
Recovery is almost the same but i think d+1+2 comes out slower.

3		Low kick
Xiaoyu's low kick from phoenix stance.It comes out fast and recovers rather quick and
ends in Phoenix stance.Good for poking or if the opponent has low life remaining.

u/f+3		Jumpkick
This is like a basic hopkick but this one has longer range and comes out surprisingly
fast.Another good juggle starter and good for mixups for the phoenix stance.

u/f+3, 3_4	Jumpkick, Thrust kick _ hopkick
her u/f+3 can be followed by any of these two kicks.
Trustkick:If the jumpkick misses this is a followup kick that stuns on CH.This does not
hit when the first kick hits.
Hopkick:  Better than Trust kick[in some situations].This move hits after the Jumpkick
hits but you need to be precise on the timing.This hits grounded oppoents so thats because
i prefer this over the Trustkick.

u/f,3		Piroette kick
this kick hit high and has strong damage.knocks opponents down FU/FA in which a fast
okizeme move is guaranteed.a CH u/f,3 makes the opponent backturned and then you have
a few frame advantage.d/b+1 is guaranteed after CH u/f,3 .

U/F#,3      Phoenix Hopsweep
One of Xiaoyu's deciving moves from Phoenix stance.She first does a small hop then follows
a fast low legsweep that floats the opponent up in mid air.This move ends in FC and is
best followed by WS+2.

3+4		Chang cannon
this ALMOST looks like michelle's move in tekken tag. but i dont know which one is better.
Xiaoyu's Chang cannon hits 3 times but the problem is its very hard to juggle with it.
you need the 2nd kick to counterhit in order to juggle your opponent and after this i cant
think of any good followups.A good thing about this move is that when this is blocked it
pushes away the opponent in a safe distance.This comes out rather slow though.

4 [~b]	Roundhouse [BT]
A high priority move that comes out rather slow. It hits mid with massive damage.
holding back causes xiaoyu to end in BT position.Knocks the opponent down when hit 
and pushes them when blocked. this is a very good move and i dont mind throwing some
of these in some matches.

f+4,4		Spin sweep,second spin sweep
A short range lowsweep that has good speed and priority.f+4 it self ends in Phoenix and
the second spin sweep ends in FC.a good poking weapon from the Phoenix stance.This has
small damage and short range which makes this a disadvantage.This does not knock down
opponents.Doing only one spinsweep is better than doing two[for me], you can follow a
4~3 after the Phoenix f+4 this is a good Phoenix stance mixup.

4~3		Scissorleg Sweep 
a direct low sweep that knocks opponents down in the ground.This comes out fast and
has good priority.Xiaoyu ends in FU/FT whether it hits or not.But when it hits a 
low kick from the lying down position is guaranteed to hit.
so thats : Phoenix 4~3 , 3

u+4		Twirling kick
Xiaoyu jumps up doing an aerial horizontal kick of some sort that hits mid.This ends
in FC.you have many options on what to follow on this move:
u+4[~U]    = ends in [BT]
u+4[~d+1+2]= ends in Phoenix stance
u+4[4]     = adds another twirling kick that ends in FC

f+3+4[~D]	Forward roll,[Phoenix Stance]
a simple forward roll towards the opponent, good for entering your opponents quarters.
Like xiaoyu's other rolls, this also evade high and some low attacks.Xiaoyu ends in FC
after this or... you can hold D while you are rolling forward so that after the roll,
you recover in Phoenix stance.

b+3+4		Backturned Position
Xiaoyu goes in her BT position with out doing any move.Recovers VERY VERY fast !!




:::::::::::::::::::::::
: V. Basic Strategies :
:::::::::::::::::::::::

The key to xiaoyu's power is her speed. Her fast mobility and fast moves that has
fast recovery.and another strong point for xiaoyu is that she has a lot of evasion
moves and can dodge opponents.In my own opinion xiaoyu has still good evasion and
it is very effective in tekken4 as it did in tekken tag.Xiaoyu is also very good 
up-close with the enemy.Another big key for winning against human opponents is to 
have the skill to wear you opponent down by keeping him/her confused and at the 
same time keeping him/her blocking what ever you want em to block(you dont want 
to let him/her block those slow recovering moves like f+3 or AOP d+1+2).


-Sidestepping(very important)
The best thing i ever learned about xiaoyu is her Triple side stepping techniques.
3ple sidestep is composed of a sidestep move going in one direction[left or right].
canceled and followed by a move that auto sidesteps in the same direction followed
by another side step that still does in that direction.Examples are:

SSR,b+3+4,SSR  ends in backturned
SSL,b+1+2,SSL  ends facing forward
SSR,d+3+4,SSR  ends facing forward
SSL,f+1+2,SSL  ends Facing or backturned[depends on the distance where you execute
						     this move]
AOP,2+4~D,SSR[rolls]Ends in FC
AOP,1+3~D,SSL[rolls]Ends in FC

You can also do a double sidestep by bypassing the first or last sidestep.

*these are just a few basic examples of triple sidestep but there is more
that you need to discover on your own.

the moves that auto-side step are:
b+3+4       right[BT]
b+1+2 	left
3+4		away from the screen
d+3+4		towards the screen
f+3+4		right[BT if very close to opponent]
FC,d/b+3+4	left[BT]
f+1+2		left
u+1+2~3+4	Right[hits mid first]
	... and more

-Backturned Mix ups
as long as you are in the BT position it is very easy to mix up your attacks. its either
you can do BT 4 to juggle your enemy,Annoy him/her by poking low using BT d+1 or d+2 and
d+3, or you can just grab em using a basic 1+3 or 2+4[u can use f,f+1+3 or f,f+2+4 if 
he or she is far]
Another thing is f+3+4 that makes xiaoyu roll towards the enemy.usually the opponent ducks
while xiaoyu is rolling.After this u can apply the mix ups.f+3+4~3+4 is very much a 
good move if ur opponent is tired of blocking mid.


-Poking String
xiaoyu has good poking moves,poking speed but does not provide strong damage.
The key to this is using her fast recovering moves and applying moves that come
out from the three positions[Forward,BT,phoenix]

ex. WS 2, 1,d+1,FC 3~2,1 , 1~d+2,d+1+2, 2......blah,blah,blah

i guess you'll get the idea. Do a move that ends in FC then do a FC move that ends
in BT position, go in the Phoenix stance after that.....and so on.


-Face to Face
remember that one of Xiaoyu's strong points is Up close. Always abuse Xiaoyu's speed
and high priority moves.but in some occasions you need to wait until your opponent
misses you or does a slow recovering move,then after that happens retaliate with a
power move like storming flower or the Twin Lifting Palms.Follow a WS+2 after you duck
high attacks or a WS+4[followed by demon flip (4~3)].

-Phoenix Canceling
While in phoenix stance... you can cancel this by means of tapping the joysick up.this
results in ending in FC.Doing FC 1+2 lets xiaoyu enter her Phoenix stance again.you can
repeat this process like d+1+2,u~d+1+2,u~d+1+2,u~d+1+2,u~d+1+2,u~d+1+2.....but you must
be very very fast...you can practice this in any tekken game that has xiaoyu.
after tapping up you can follow FC moves like FC,d/f+2,1 or WS 4 or to make it even move
confusing you can do a FC,d/b+3+4 which ends in BT... or while you're in Phoenix stance
quickly throw in a 4~3 to sweep them off thier feet.....BWEHEHEHE
Once you practice this Technique expect your opponent mezmerized and dazzled.

-101 ways to get in close
There are several ways to get near your opponent.f,f+3+4 recovers fast but make sure you land
in front your opponent and make sure you make him/her block that move so that you get the
frame advantage, usually i follow-up with a basic d+2 if it gets blocked. but if it does hit
i follow a basic grab or d/f+2~1 for a quick juggle.
Or... you have all six directions for an attack. you can attack from above,below,front,
left,right or from behind. To do this you need to learn her evasion techniques and her
triple sidesteps, you can do her forward rolls to get near and dodge mid and high attacks
then hit em with a WS or FC move [i prefer some f,f moves after the roll]or start you 
poking strings from there. 
Also use her f,f+4~4 to get close safely. when you get this move to hit you have a few 
frames in your advantage. But when this move is blocked you will be flipping back where
you started leaving you in a fairly safe distance and very good recovery

-Taunting
Very good against almost every occation.Against a computer, after doing a 1+3+4 or a 2+3+4,
the computer does not try to attack until the taunt is finished. you can cancel the taunt
with the other taunt then the other with the other and so on....the computer WILL attack
if u do this upclose.
Remember that a taunt can always be canceled anytime with anything. after doing a 1+3+4 
or a 2+3+4 then your opponents tries to charge you with a move you can always throw some
fast moves to counter his/her attack. I use 1,2>1 or a d/b+1 ......
another thing that 2+3+4 can also be used after the opponent hits hard on the wall.2+3+4
hits the falling opponent knocking him/her back to the wall.. another thing is
if the taunt [2+3+4] hits standed opponent you can guaranteed some moves [anything below
19 frames] like d/b+1 or a grab..
Another thing is that after hitting your opponent to the wall using 1+3 you can hit him/her
with 2+3+4 which leaves the opponent open for your attacks..the trick here is you should
be very fast in executing the 2+3+4 and canceling it into another move such as d/f+2~1 or
d/b+1.
But The best use for this is after you beat your opponent... 

-Back Turned canceling
During her backturned position,you can tap back to enter the facing forward position.
This technique is very useful.. the notation is BT~d. The cool part about this move
is that you are considered facing forward.. im not very sure about some moves but you 
can surely follow : d+3 ,d/f+2, b+4 ,1+2 etc..(i think any move that does not use d,
and f,f)
Another thing is that if u tap d/b after het back turned position. you will end up 
instantly in FC, meaning you can throw her FC moves like WS 4, WS 2 or FC d/f+2.
note: you'll have to wait until the last frame in order to make the next move.

-Phoenix Backtured technique
after canceling her BT by tapping back,follow her phoenixstance(d+1+2) this will
result in a phoenix stance which is in backturned, but this only holds for a
couple of seconds *i think* before she faces her opponent in Facing forward position,
while in this position you can Do her back turned moves.Like BT 4 or BT 1. 
This looks cool and comes out very fast and this comes out from a backturned 
phoenix stance !!! BTW ... I was able to keep the Phoenix stance in Back turned
for a couple of seconds until a threw a BT 4.

-Butt wiggle
this is just a little thing i just discovered.Go in Xiaoyu's Phoenix stance and do a
reverse windgodfist motion(just b,d,db or b,b,d,only)repeatedly or a d,db,b. ... you'll
notice Xiaoyu does a little wiggling movement.I only use this when i want to grab 
peoples attention.hhehehehe.Watch this action in the replay mode where you will see 
it in slow motion to get a better view...




^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
> VI. Opponents <
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-Chrisite-
Against a very good Chrisite player, the only problem you may encounter is not able to
hit Christie well ir not getting those juggle starters in. Christie has 2 stances both
evades high and once you hit her with any juggle starter it wont juggle her but rather
knock her off her stance. I often use okieme tactics against her and you shouldnt have 
any problem, expect the match to last very long. Use Xiaoyu's 4~3 which is does a very
important role in fighting Chrisite.Also,Parrying is also one of the important tactics
Againt Christie,Once you get the parry in, you then can start juggling the crap out of
Christie or Hit her with a Very high damaging move. Use d/f+2~1 for juggling and d/b+4
or f,f+1+2~1+2 for heavy damage.
You can hit Christie with d/b+3 once shes in her Handstand or Relaxed stance causing 
her to float for a quick juggle.
The most important move against Christie is probably xiaoyu's 4~3 and f,f+3+4

-Marduk-
I noticed that Marduk's power comes from his high attacks but his juggle starters come
from mid and some of those moves come out really fast,like his d/f+1.Sidesteping is the
key to win agaist this guy.Most of his Power moves does not track so you must use that
to your advantage.Using Phoenix stance is also good as long as you dont stay in it for
too long.Another Thing you should know about MArduk is his ValeTudo stance,Some moves
of the ValeTudo stance tracks well but some hits high,once hes in the valetudo stance
try jumping over him using f,f+3+4 or try poking him out of it. Xiaoyu's SSl,f+1+2 can
evade His Tackle from the ValeTudo stance just make sure hes not close enough, you can
cancel his tackle with a b+1 or b+2.
Overall... Marduk can be an easy opponent. Expect to land moves as a Counterhit like
ss+4.Dont be scared of attacking him upclose, xiaoyu's moves have more priority than
his. and with the Sidesteping tactics, he'll have trouble hitting you.

-Paul-
I was fighting a lot of good pauls lately.. and the only move that kept hitting me was
paul's d+1+2 . This move could hit xiaoyu while she's in her backturned , while shes 
rolling, during her phoenix stance.The Best way to fight against a paul is probablty
using her sidesteping and sidewalking game, altough you can easily get hit by paul you
also need to play a waiting game against paul. Another way is to block or parry paul's
attacks then hit him with d/f+2~1 or d/b+1.

-King-
Well, Luckly, King depends on grabs but remember that King has those very fast pokes
and powerful moves. Dont stay too long in the Backturned postition.Keeping King at
Bay by using your own pokes is also a very important, Be very cautious with King's
d+1,2 that has high priority than some of xiaoyu's pokes. A good weapon is xiaoyu's
Phoenix stance and her AOP 2,1 that ducks King's high attacks and has greater priority
over king's mid moves.

-Violet/Lee-
so far i was having trouble getting through violet's defense.. namely his hitman stance.
he can auto block,has big sidestep,high range evasion,has several options of attack and
still can block low attacks... usually i attack somewhere on mid/far range using the SS+4
or d+3 .. poking up close is very important specially the 1,2>1 . DO NOT stay in BT position
upclose for too long, lee has many many attacks that hit low where in you cannot evade or
sidestep... phoenix stance can be very heplful aslong as you know when your opponent will
strike low. Retaliate with WS moves after ducking his high attacks[lee has more high/low
attacks than his mid attacks.]
Overall... you can use sidestep tactics and low attacks to kill em' ..

these are just a few juggles i've compiled so far.I know more but
i dont have the energy to type. Just try mixing up these juggles.
the ones with [*] are the ones i prefer best and i am comfortable
using in terms of damage and difficulty..

||||||||||||||||||||||||

well i hope you got what u needed to know or what you needed to learn.The reason i
made this faq is that so many people that are interested in studying xiaoyu .
And besides not many people use xiaoyu. I am NOT the best xiaoyu(yet)
but i belive that im an above average xiaoyu user and i do not rely on cheapness to win.
Another reason is that i want to prove that there are more characters better than 
mishimas and those characters need more talent and effort compared to those lame 
mishimas.You dont need talent when using Mishimas all you need to learn it to do the
crouchdash and you're all set to become your country's "CHAMPION".So do email me 
for some questions,erections *i mean* corrections,update, new juggles, good 
strategies,etc at tseng@edsamail.com.ph your email will be very much appriciated.
Ill immediately answer and acknowledge your emails once ive read them.
