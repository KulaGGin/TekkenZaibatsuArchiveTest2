1 Why this faq?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason I'm writing this faq is that no one has bothered writing one and posting it in TZ 
yet. It almost looks like someone is holding back vital Yoshi information, that's just cheap 
folks! It is 2004 so it's a little late for this faq, but who the hell cares right. The purpose of this 
faq is not to give you a bulletproof tactic on how to beat every single player out there, but to 
give you an idea on how to play a real tough game with Yoshi.

I will not list every move he has, but I will be sure to list the moves he has that I consider 
"safe" moves and some follow-ups from these. This faq is to be considered as a tactic faq for 
Yoshi on how to stand toe to toe with…everyone!

Ps. I will not list any special mix-ups, I will however list some moves with follow-ups. What 
you do before and afterwards are up to you and your fingers. The creation of your own mix-
ups is one of the things that make this game worth playing, so try using your imagination.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 Why pick Yoshimitsu?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well if you are reading this faq you might have one of these to reasons: 
1: You wanna learn more about this ultra-flashy character.
2: You are having difficulties beating him. 

My reason for picking Yoshi is simply this. When I got Tekken 4 I first learned the easy-
cheesy Jin (he was one of my favourites from T3), I then moved on to Law (also an T-3 
favourite) then Bryan, Lei, Bob (Hwoarang), Christie, Ling, Marduk, and.. oh well you got 
the picture. Yoshi just didn't seem to cut (?) it anymore. While almost every player had gotten 
some new properties and flashy moves, Yoshi seemed to be that same very, very old character 
that everyone knew about. He seemed weak due to the fact that many of the elements of 
surprise regarding his unblockables were gone, people knew his style; or at least they thought 
they did! At first glance it looks like he has poor follow-ups from sweeps and launchers.

Well, I have always liked string-based fighting (BOB's my main man) and Yoshi's all about 
mix-ups so I didn't think too much about him. And no one of my friends, or my brother and 
his friends, were playing him either so why worry right! Well after sitting down with Yoshi 
and choosing him over Bob, Lei and Ling in actual VS fights for a month or two I have now 
changed my opinion, Yoshi actually has a equally strong mix-up game as Ling – maybe even 
better cause his seem to adjust to whomever his playing against. While Ling has great 
advantages over some she just plain sucks against others. Yoshi on the other hand has a really 
well balanced fighting style that makes sure he's always a hard fight, right from Hwoarang 
and quickie Steve to power Marduk and the Mishimas. He is unquestionable extremely fast, 
has great recovery time and he's mind games are about the best there is if you are up against a 
good turtler. Ooh and I almost forgot, Yoshi is now the ONLY really good guy (Julia is a girl) 
in T4, while others are has-beens, drunks, in dept or out for revenge. Yoshi is actually in the 
Iron Fist Tournament to save some poor starving kids or something. So if you win with yoshi 
you can say: Good ALWAYS prevails over evil, ha ha ha! But stop after the tenth time or so 
before you get knocked out (you – not Yoshi).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 Yoshi's enemies.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Well Yoshi's fighting style makes sure that he has no real enemies and he can easily stand toe 
to toe with Jin, Kazuya or Christie. So unlike Bob you don't need a whole faq on how to beat 
King for instance. Ooh, and if your having trouble with Steve, this is your man (space Ninja). 
Still if I have to mention one enemy there is one tough fight in T-4 for Yoshi and that's the 
other dead guy in T-4, namely Bryan Fury. Hmm it seems that jab-maniacs such as Jin an 
Paul also can cause some troubles to Yoshi as well, but I still find Bryan to be the hardest 
match.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 Strengths and weaknesses
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Strengths:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well he's most obvious strength is of course his large arsenal of unblockables, he has the 
most in the game and they all are moves you will need to use from time to time. He also has 
speed, the best 1,2,1 jab in the game and the best right uppercut launcher in the game, he 
actually steps forward when doing he's uppercut making it a powerful weapon - even though 
he's juggle follow-ups after launch are not as good as Bob's.

He has good movement and strong evasion tactics. 

He has the most moves in the game. If you count all the moves Yoshi can steal he is very 
close to 800 different moves!

He can break almost ANY opponent pressuring strings and mix-ups with ease.

He can steal tricks from his opponent and do them back on a just frame basis, which means 
they always will come out at their fastest. He will also do some (not all) JF moves if he steals 
them, like Jin's JF f,d,d/f+2 uppercut for instance.

He is very confusing.

He has the best wall-run-to-kick in the game. If timed correctly he flips around and lands 
behind your opponent and is facing his back while he is facing the wall. You often get a free 
back kick and a wall stun juggle.

Okizme. He has some good okizeme and wake-up-game options, not great –but useful. Well I 
feel I need to add something here. Yoshi can actually play a real mean okizeme and wake-up 
game; not much is 100% guaranteed, but if your opponent backrolls or does a rising kick at 
the wrong time you can keep him on the ground and murder him in no time at all. Actually 
Yoshi has such a good mind-and-okizeme game that he only really need to knock you to the 
ground once and from there he can take away the rest of your life in a custom string rush that 
no other player can match (physical and esthetical), always making the opponent choose low 
or mid.

Turtling. Yoshi actually feeds of turtling, like only a ghost can do.

Bulldogging. He has all the moves needed to bulldog someone right from the get-go to the 
end.

Sidesteppers. Yoshi owns people who rely strictly on a sidestepping game or just sidestep too 
much.

Walls. Yoshi has a great wall game.

The kick reversal specialists. Hwoarang is great when facing Nina, King and Marduk. Still 
Paul and Jin (yes Jin has a kick and punch reversal just like in T3, you just don't see it too 
much and it's now called attack reversal) can cause some troubles though.

Life. Yoshi has multiple ways of regaining life in a fight. Sometimes a mere 5 points more in 
life could make you the winner of a match.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Weaknesses:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Throws: He has some cool throws, but not the best this game has to offer. 

Range: Yoshi is generally good at all distances, but if we do a distance scale from 0 to 5 
where 0 is in your face and 5 is on the other side of the screen Yoshi is not the best fighter at 
distance 4 to 5 (King and Heiachi is). 

Juggles: Many of Yoshi's juggles are somewhat weak, but he's launchers and juggle starters 
connect so often he really don't need those ultra-flashy life draining juggles – just settle for 40 
something in damage.

Moves that move: Yoshi has some movement moves, but not too many and they generally just 
move him in a linear attack which means they are easily sidestepped. Unfortunately he don't 
have any moves that auto-sidestep, so those double and triple sidesteps are not an option. He 
is still a mover though, just not like in the same way as Bob or Ling.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5 My basic movelist
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


First let me say that I haven't been studying the frame database, but I know from actual VS 
fights that all these moves work quite well. The best way to find mix-ups and safe moves is to 
play against humans, NOT studying and memorizing the frame database (still it is only simple 
math when reading frames, so you can make up some useful and hard too break strings doing 
so if you please).

1,2 
It a basic left right punch. A good move. Hits high and mid. Just the 1 punch by itself can be a 
very useful move. Try just pressing 1 and immediately afterwards press d,d/b,b+1+2 and do 
the rainbow drop, this flows very nice and very few people tend to duck the throw due to the 
mid hitting 2 punch that usually follows the high 1 punch.

1,2,1
It's Yoshi's jabbing game. This is your best friend and everyone's worst enemy. Its 8 frames 
fast and hits h,m,m. If the first connects the rest is guaranteed. Use this to start a match or to 
(re)gain momentum, it can be abused to some degree. If some bastard 1,2 jabs alot you can try 
to retaliate with this. A useful move, but if it's blocked you will take some jab retaliation.

f+2
Backhand slap. This set's you up for a back throw or a juggle with the d/f+2. I always go for 
the back throw witch is unblockable if done at it's fastest and make a neat 70 points in 
damage witch means you just took away over half of your opponents life bar, no need to say 
you should win this match. The breakdown here is: f+2~F+2+4. If you need to shorten the 
distance a bit before the throw do this: f+2,b+1,2+4, If you decide to juggle with the d/f+2 
and the spins, you should be near a wall where you can inflict some major juggle damage and 
exceed the damage you get from a back throw. This move is a lot better than I first realized 
you can mix this move with the d/b+2,2,2 for additional confusion and avoiding some of the 
long wind-up time from the f+2. Also you can easily mix your d/b+2,2,2 spins into almost any 
high priority move you like.

d/f+1,2
This is the start of the door knocker and then the backhand slap, not so useful really, but you 
still get the free back throw if both connect. Still chances are they won't so stick to the one 
above instead. You can also mix this up with manji spin slaps (d/b+2,2,2) after the initial two 
punches, and the manji spin slaps can in it's turn again be mixed up with any move you like. 
Alone this is a simple move that's not that good, mixed up with the slaps this becomes an 
efficient and deadly move. I have started using this a lot after I realized it's great offensive 
properties.

d/f+1,1,1,1
The doorknocker. Use this to pressure your opponent or the first three hits as a juggle. It's not 
a real good move, but it's not that bad either. It will take care of duckers and sidesteppers and 
is reasonably fast. The two first hits are safe on block. Try this mix-up: d/f+1,1,d/b+1 and 
then u/f+3 / WS+4 / WS+1 or 2 or FC+d/f+1 or 3, or this: d/f+1,1,d+2,WS+4,d/f+4,SS+1

d/f+3,1
Wood cutter. This will sometimes gain momentum quite good. If the kick connects the sword 
is guaranteed. The cheesy way of finishing someone off. Also this is an okay juggler. A good 
move, but everyone has seen this like a trillion times before. Unfortunately you can actually 
be out jabbed or SS in between these two moves if the kick is blocked. Oh, and even if the 
sword hits you are not safe from jabs afterwards so either active guard or attack. There is 
really only one safe set-up that I have to get this move in outside of juggles. When your on the 
ground do a backroll to a spring forward that hits, immediately follow with the d/f+3 and the 
following sword slice. You can of course after the foot connects SS or keep up the pressure by 
attacking with spins or customs. You recover while crouching after the kick so you can easily 
do any FC move as an alternative offence after the kick connects.

d/f+2
It's Yoshi's step-in uppercut launcher. He moves forward with a fast step when executing this 
mid hitting move, he also ducks some highs during the animation. These three facts and its 
speed make it the best right uppercut launcher in the game. See juggle chapter for more. I 
think of this as Yoshi's third best launcher, but in reality it just might be better. If you wanna 
make this your # 1 launcher, be my guest. If blocked you will take some damage if you don't 
active guard.. Tenshimitsu made me aware of this little bug, I tested it and to my surprise this 
actually works every time: when Paul does his d+1,4,2,1+2 (you know, the easy one of the the 
JF's he has) you can out jab him and launch him with d/f+2 right in between the 2 and the JF 
1+2 and get a free juggle of your choice. I'll just say what Tenshimitsu said: this is a 
stressless follow up –even if paul don't get in the last JF move. However if Paul decides to do 
his somewhat tougher to spot JF move - d+4,2,1+2 - you can't interrupt in between the two 
last hits for some reason, bugs will be bugs I guess.

d/f+4
No more than a fast right side kick. Good for annoyance and gaining the momentum. A good 
move. This is generally used in mix-ups and custom strings and I throw in a couple in a 
match. Pretty safe on block and your at some distance. Try this mix-up or a shorter version of 
it: d/b+1,WS+1,d/f+4,d/f+2,d+1,WS+1,d/f+4

FC,d/f+3
The lunging sweep kick. This is a really fast and confusing low kick that knocks down and 
launches on hit. You have some juggle/okizeme options after this if your quick. Don't be 
afraid to use/abuse this move cause it's hard to see it coming and block low in time before 
their used to the animation. I think of this is Yoshi's best juggle/okizme starter. If this is 
blocked you will take some damage. You have pretty high damage juggle options and normal 
damage juggle options after this hits. See juggle chapter for more. This kick also travel 
serious distances so you can use this when a low sword sweep won't hit, actually the longer 
the distance you do this trick from, the greater the chance is of you sweeping him off his feet; 
due to the speed, the ducking animation and the step forward you will dodge many attacks 
during the animation. If you do this up close you can easily be duck-jabbed or SS out of it.

u/f+3
The rising knee. This is a really good move. I think of this as Yoshi's second best launcher, 
and your main weapon against duckers, backrollers and special stances like Ling's phoenix 
stance or Steve's swaying. If it's blocked you have somewhat decent frames but you can still 
be jabbed though. Use set-ups to get this in every time. See juggle chapter for follow-
ups/juggles. If you only have one launcher this is the universal one that will work wonders on 
all the different characters in the game. This will soon become one of your dearest and 
deadliest friends if you play a lot with Yoshi.

FC,d/f+1
Low sword sweep. Use this in the same situations as the lunging sweep kick only somewhat 
closer. You get juggle/okizeme options after this, and it's unblockable. Very good against 
turtlers and somewhat bad against pitbulls. I think of this as Yoshi's fourth best launcher. You 
have one very high damage juggle after this hits. See juggle chapter for more.

SS+4
Whirlwind. This is a move for defence and baiting for a counter hit. Try to SS a incoming 1,2 
punch or a strictly linear attack, If this hit's on the CH your opponent will be stunned giving 
you very nice stun-juggle options. See juggle chapter for more.

D/B+1+2,1 or 2 Hold d/b during the whole sequence.
Death pose and the bad breath. This is reasonably fast, ducks highs and throws, hits high and 
is unblockable. If it hits you get a stun with juggle options like the one above. See juggle 
chapter for more. All in all this is a very useful move. I think of this as a launcher/juggle 
starter equal to or the d/f+2 uppercut. Hey it IS unblockable right! I use this move a lot from a 
distance where I know it won't hit anyone, why you ask me? Well baiting of course is my 
answer to you dear reader. People will be annoyed by you standing still at one spot puffing 
bad breath into open space, eventually they will rush in right after the cloud of poison breath 
disappers, but you of course expect this and either launch him with u/f+3 or just do the regular 
oni kick (3) that gets those that run in and sidestep you.

4~3
The Kangaroo kick. It's your highest launcher. Punish slow high attacks with this. You get 
some juggle options after this hits. Also you can do this move out of Flea (3+4) and Indian sit 
arts (3+4). I don't use it too much due to the slow animation and poor recovery time, but you 
can for instance fake a fubuki and do this instead. Here's the breakdown. f,f+4~3 (thanx goes 
out to Tenshimitsu's great Yoshi faq for showing me this move) Also you can try this to make 
punches whiff and get the kangaroo launcher in on CH: u/f+3+4,3+4. You can of course do 
u/f+3+4,d+3+4,3,3+4 for greater confusion, but I'd stick to the one above instead.

SS+1
Inner palm. This causes guard break so it's a fairly good move. Juggles on the CH. Use it 
occasionally. Well after some advice I started to use this move more, it actually connects a lot 
and is 99% safe on block if you active guard afterwards, which makes this an excellent move 
instead of just fairly good. It duck highs, and even some mids, and of course hits mid itself. 
Also this can also work nice as a match opener. See juggle chapter for more. WOW! I now 
use this move constantly. Try starting and ending matches with this, you will be surprised 
over its properties, this actually connects 8 of 10 times. I now use this as one of my set-ups for 
my true offence and I just love this move.

SS+2
Shrine lift. This juggles on hit and is safer on block than the one above, but really not a better 
move still (actually not much worse either). See juggle chapter for more. Well after testing 
this out a bit it looks like I misjudged it. This is actually a quite efficient launcher. It of course 
has a small sidestep (duh), dodges highs, takes care of duckers and has ok reach. You also flip 
your opponent leaving him face down and towards you in the air, which by the way is the 
second best way to have someone floating in the air when going for a juggle. Still the SS+1 is 
a better move in the same type if situations when you think about it.

f,f+4
Fubuki. This is a real fast knee (fastest knee in the game!) that travels good distances and hits 
mid. Use this when people try to roll back to safety after a knockdown, or when you expect 
something like a mach kick and you beat him to it. Or just when opportunity seems fit. If this 
one is blocked your in trouble, it has very poor frame advantage (-17) on block so don't just 
throw it out or you will be inside a throw or a juggle pretty soon. Also you can use this to 
punish incoming slow, long range power moves like Heiachi's iron fist. A very useful move. 
You can delay it and increase it's range by pressing f,f,N,f+4. Sweet. (thanx too Tenshimitsu 
for this one

f,f+2
This is your flashiest way of punishing "slow" long range moves like Kings shoulder rush. Hit 
on the CH and you'll go straight thru him (like a ghost) and drain him for some life. Nice, 
good-looking, flashy move. You can delay it and increase it's range by pressing f,f,N,2. Also 
if you go straight in IND (d+3+4) after this move the damage will just be 26 points, not your 
regular 36 points.

f,f+1+2
It's the dive bomb. This covers good distances, hits mid and leaves your back turned against 
your opponent, from where you can either go in IND for confusion or just slap him low by 
pressing d+1. I prefer d+1 after this is blocked. Well Tenshimitsu knows best, she tells me 
that d+1 will not hit those jab abusers out there, so if your up against one of those damn jab-
crazy Jin's and Paul's try to sidestep or duck immediately or go straight in IND and do a 
move the wrong way or simply disappear (F or B) to get out of harms way.

f,f+3+4,1+2,3+4
It's the shark attack to dive bomb to kangaroo kick. All in all pretty useless if done without a 
set-up, and even with set-ups it's not a good move. It covers major distances and can 
sometimes make your opponent whiff an attack at the end giving you some options, still not a 
useful move at all. This can of course get newbees for that fast high damage if you feel like 
being cheesy.

(f)+3
The Oni kick (Oni means evil I think) This is a spin kick that does decent damage. Use this to 
punish whiffed moves and near walls. Also use this as a throw or launcher set-up if they 
expect the usual follow-ups from this and block low or active guard. The F input gives some 
extra damage. This snags sidesteppers easily. This is also a nice juggle ender.

(f)+3,3
Ballerina kick. Same as above, plus a low kick that trip on hit after the high is blocked. A 
good move, but be careful, it's easy doing this move one time to many. The F input gives 
some extra damage and gives you poorer recovery time (this goes for most –maybe all- moves 
that inflict higher damage with a F input; meaning the F main use is in juggles). This snags 
sidesteppers easily. This is also your main juggle after certain moves. The low kick cannot be 
parried, just blocked; this fact makes this move very good indeed. If the low is blocked 
however you will take some damage.

(f)+3,4
Zig-Zag. It's a Spin kick and then a mid kick that stuns near walls. Mix this one up with the 
two above. A good move, but if your opponent sees this he will punish you in between your 
kicks and get you on the CH. Use sparingly. The F input gives some extra damage. This snags 
sidesteppers very easily.

(f)+3,d/f+3+4
Zig to kangaroo kick. This can be useful at times, but easy to be jabbed out of at the end if 
expected, and poor recovery time on block. Gives you some juggle options of course.

(f)+3,d+3+4
Zig to Indian sit arts. This can be useful at times, but easy to interrupt if expected. Can work 
as a nice mind game if playing someone who is used to see the ballerina kicks everytime you 
do the Oni (Zig) kick.

(f)+4,4,(4)
Triple roundhouse kick. If the first kick hits the second is guaranteed. If the second hits 
normal the third kick can be ducked. If the second hit is blocked impossible to duck the last 
kick and your opponent must block it. If the second kick hits on the CH the third kick is 
guaranteed. If the third is blocked -or hits- you turn your opponent to the side for more 
options, try the Fubuki (f,f+4), but nothing is guaranteed. All in all this is a good move and 
the two first kicks is also an ok wall juggle. All three kicks hit high and snag sidesteppers. Try 
to only do the first two kicks as a set-up for the lunging sweep kick or a mix-up of your own.

u/f+4
Avoid the puddle. Now this is a real good move. It avoids lows and hits mid. Use this when 
you expect a low move. This snags sidesteppers to your left easily. Also this stuns near walls. 
You must have the wall on your right side. Use this move.

1+2
Flea art. You quickly sit on top of your sword. Use this to avoid low and mid attacks. Nice 
against Christie when she's in her friggin dancing kicking frenzy. Follow up a hit with 1+2. 
Read more on the Flea sword slice and it's special properties in the juggle chapter or in the 
special stances chapter.

d+1
Regular sword slice. A bit slow, but use this when opponent is on the ground or just to pick 
away he's last bit of life. Hey, it IS unblockable so use it okay. It gives 10 points in damage 
on the ground, which all in all is pretty good for such a simple okizeme move.

d+1+2
Well this juggles your opponent up from the ground if he tries to rise with a kick. Useful in 
that particular situation, but not so useful in others where you have safer options.

d+2
Yoshi's quick special mid poke. Use this to stop strings and bullies.

FC+d+1 or d/b+1
Same as above. Very useful in mix-ups and 2 frames quicker than your smid d+2 poke.

b+1,1,d/b+3,3,f+4
This is a nice little pressure string. It hit's h,h,l,l,m and knocks down on the last kick. Use this 
when you can't think of anything else. It actually connects quite often. A good string. You can 
also go straight in IND by pressing d+3+4 when doing your low kicks.

b+1,1,1,1,1,1
Stone fists. Use as a juggle. Never really use this move as anything else than a juggle. You 
have better options.

D/B+3,3,3,3,3,3
I never really use this whole string in normal fights. If you wanna do it anyway do this instead 
d/b+3,(3),(3),(3),(3),f+4 Or if he's blocking all the low kicks and the optional mid this next 
one can be real sweet. d/b+3,(3),(3),(3),N,D,d/f+1 which has the unblockable low sword 
sweep at the end. Surprise, surprise. :) It is nice to know that if the first kick hits the second is 
guaranteed. Also you can go straight in IND by doing this: d/b+3,(3)~d+3+4 It's a nice little 
evasion move which is good if the kicks are blocked, you might be hit by a rising uppercut, 
still this won't launch you –just hit you away to safety.

D/B+2,2,2,2,2,2
Manji Spin Slaps. Well don't do many of these spins. Try this: d/b+2,(2),(d+1),WS+4,d/f+4. 
The d/b+2 can work as a throw set-up as well as a set-up for any WS attacks. All in all the 
first two slaps is an okay move. Try this as well: D/B+2,2,f+4

1+4
Soul Stealer. Stop your opponent in whatever he's doing and hopefully you steal a move as 
well. This is mainly used in turtle tactics. I could probably write a whole faq concentrating on 
the Soul Stealer, but I just wont do it! It's too much work.. Steal a move turtle around, hit him 
once or twice, wait for a whiffed move or a opening and unleash the stolen move (1+4). Keep 
in mind that stolen moves work as juggle enders VERY often so there you go, you hopefully 
now can juggle someone for 40-60 easy points in damage. Ooh, and pay attention to what 
moves your stealing okay!

b,b+1~1,N,(b~b)
Yoshi loads up he's sword and then starts spinning it like a madman. Hit's mid and is 
unblockable. This can be real sweet if you grounded someone near a wall or corner and you 
do it right away. Just don't get predictable with it and it will work wonders. Also this can 
work well at distances. If you hit someone near a wall be sure to cut the sword spin short by 
pressing b~b while it's spinning. Also this can work nice after grounding someone with a 
throw. I discovered something cool when fighting Nina the other day, I did the sword spin 
when Nina came rushing in on me with a jumping attack. She of course got hit by my sword 
while floating in the air and I cancelled my sword spin with b~b at the same time. What 
happened then? Well she did not only get hit by the sword spin, but the sword spin cancel also 
causes some damage and hit her in the air as well making this a two hit combo. I'm not sure 
but I guess the damage of the cancel is about 15-20 points.  The initial damage is 30 points so 
if you manage to connect both the spin and the cancel it makes out very nice damage indeed.

b,b+1~1+2
He draws his sword and chops your opponent in his scull. It's a bit slow and don't connect to 
often as it is easily sidestepped. Still this is unblockable so it can be helpful at distance 2-2,5 
if your opponent expects the sword spin instead and just keeps on standing still.

d,d/f,f+1
The moonsault slayer. This is Yoshimitsu's signature move. Everyone has seen this move 
before, which means the element of surprise is very much gone. It is very easily sidestepped 
so don't just throw it out to close in on your opponent. Try it when people have a habit of 
rising straight up from a knockdown and going into block mode, or just don't play a 
sidestepping game at a distance. Hmm maybe even if they are caught in a corner after a 
knockdown, during a backroll or if you are at a distance and they are having trouble 
sidestepping due to the wall.

WS+1
The WS left uppercut is a very useful move. Unlike many of Yoshi's moves this gives you 
nice frame adv. Try a fubuki or a throw after this hits. This is good for mix-ups and custom 
strings. Try this: d/b+1,WS+1,d/f+4,d+1

WS+4
Like the one above this is also safe on block and has it's place in mix-ups and in custom 
strings. Try fubuki or a rising knee (u/f+3) after this hits. Or just go on your own jabbing 
frenzy. This move actually has quite nice reach and damage for such a simple WS attack.

WS+1+2
It looks somewhat like the WS+1 when you execute this move. It's a quick uppercut (it's 
called quick upper) and has its place in mix-ups and custom strings.

WS+3
It has some power (25 points I think), but still it's not a useful move. For some reason I whiff 
this a lot, similar to the Hwoarang bug that his WS+3 has. It's a shame, but what are we going 
to do, well try to use WS+4 instead of this for starters.

2~3
Flash attack. It's flashy for sure, and not a bad move. Still it's not that useful either. Use this 
once or twice in a fight if you please. I have never liked such simple moves like the regular 
PK-combo is, but I do not urge people to be like me in this faq. Some high level players with 
Yoshi use this move a lot and praise it's properties so I guess it's a safe and good move, still 
boring though.

2~d+3
Low flash attack. You recover while crouching after this move so try to follow it up with 
FC,d/f+1 (low sword sweep) or the FC,d/f+3 (lunging sweep kick) or some rising attacks. 
Unlike the one above I use this PK combo, not a lot but from time to time. Always make a 
guessing game of what comes next after.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 Special stances
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In these next chapters I will go thru Yoshis special stances and the moves out of them. His 
three special stances are not his greatest offensive and bullying weapons, but they certainly 
work very nice as set-ups and for added confusion. If you successfully manages to use the 
stances to your advantage you will discover a whole new Yoshi to play with. Fun, fun, fun!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2 Flea stance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1+2 
Flea. You quickly mount your sword and stop any mid and low attack (almost anyway) with 
this unblockable move. This unblockable move has many special properties. Read on.

1+2,N Your sword is active and will inflict some damage if it hits someone. About 15-20 
points in damage.
1+2,N If you hit your opponent the sword is no longer active and he can do any low attack 
without taking any damage, the low attacks will usually go straight thru your sword NOT 
knocking you down.
1+2~U You have now activated your sword and you load it up! (doesn't show on the sword 
but he's wings are moving very fast if, and when, you loaded it) The sword will now do 30 
points in damage! Nice.
1+2~U,N You first activate your sword, and then you cancel the load with the neutral input. 
The neutral input itself gives 20 points in damage which means that if you connect both the 
sword load-up and the load cancel by a wall you have inflicted 50 points in damage without 
the additional wall damage. Very sweet indeed.  The other way of fully utilizing (almost 
anyway) your sword from Flea is simply by mounting it as early as possible and letting your 
opponent slide down the edge for a longer time, this requires somewhat better timing and thus 
the first way is recommended.

So you see for yourself that Yoshi's sword mounting style isn't shitty at all. It is actually quite 
good if you now how to work it. –see wall juggles section-

1+2~U,N,1+2 
What you see here is the headbutt from your normal flea stance. You can of course just do 
1+2,1+2, but the damage is less. The last 1+2 juggles on CH. If you should get him airborne 
on the CH, press f+3,3 as an easy juggle. This ducks high hits and some mids as well.

1+2~U,N,f,f (3+4)
Go straight in flea and do the running flea. By itself and out of wall reach this move totally 
sucks. Still you can cut the recovery time short by going straight in IND afterwords. You just 
press (d+)3+4 while he does his third (maybe it's the second?) and last hop forward.

1+2,3+4 
Go in Flea and do the Kangaroo kick. It can be good as a punch dodging move. I still don't 
use this too much. Hmm maybe I should. I have now tested this move out a bit and people 
surprisingly often falls for this "slow" move. It seems they have learned not to attack low 
while Yoshi is in Flea (duh!) so usually a normal 1,2 punch or a regular 4 kick is what's most 
likely to come out. This will of course whiff you and you get the juggle you were baiting for.

1+2,d+3+4
Well obviously you first go into Flea and then straight in Indian sit arts from where you can 
disappear for instance, or just surprise him with a quick Indian moonsault slayer (1).

U/F or U/B
Yoshi hops at his opponent coming down sword first for 20 plus in damage points. This can 
be very useful from time to time, but it has poor recovery time though. Still if you knock 
someone away from you with the 1+2 okizeme you can sometimes successfully hop towards 
them and get them once more when they are rising. If this hit's near a wall you simply press 
f,f to do the running flea over him as a small wall juggle.

3 or 4
No more than a quick evasion spin to his left or right. It can be helpful, but not too much 
unfortunately. This also activates your sword once again if you already have hit someone with 
it.

You can tell if the sword is active or not after a hit by looking at Yoshi's wings. If they move 
in an insect like fluttering way after a hit, the sword is now active once again.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3 Indian sit stance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From this stance Yoshi can regain his life if needed by leaving your controller in neutral. This 
is my most used stance, and it has extremely many uses when it comes to baiting. Now on to 
the moves out of his IND stance.

d+3+4,3+4(hold), f or b or u or d
Yoga slide. When entering IND you hover just above the floor and can move in any direction. 
Funny move, but not that useful. It can be used to gain distance though.

d+3+4,1
You go in IND, disappear for a moment and then come down from the sky with the quick 
Indian moonsault slayer. This can be very useful as it is unblockable. However it also is easily 
sidestepped. 15 points in damage.

d+3+4,3
You go in IND and do the dive bomb out of it. This takes 40 points in damage ducks highs 
and hit's mid. Not much to say really. Use sparingly and after set-ups.

d+3+4,3,3+4
You go in IND and do the dive bomb and then the Kangaroo kick, which gives you, juggle 
options. By it self this combo does heavy damage, but you still won't connect it too often.

d+3+4,4
You go in IND and do the Kangaroo kick which gives you juggle options. Not much you say 
because the slow animation and I agree. Not much indeed.

d+3+4,2,d/b+2,2,2,2
You go in IND and do the manji spin slaps out of it. They all hit mid. Hmm, if you decide to 
use this try only doing the first manji spin slap and then a lunging sweep kick, a rising knee or 
a low sword sweep.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.4 Meditation stance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


From this stance Yoshi can regain his life if needed by leaving your controller in neutral. Now 
on to the moves out of his MED stance. This stance is by many considered to be he's better 
stance.

(SS)+3+4
You are now in your meditation stance.

(SS)+3+4,3+4
While in MED you do a back flip that nicely juggles your opponent. A good move with juggle 
options of course.

(SS)+3+4,1+2
While in MED you turn around and do the sword hilt healing regaining some life and taking 
away 10 points of your opponents life if he attacks. A flashy move for sure, but useful? Yeah, 
well it's not a bad move to put it that way. If it hits see your opponent crumple to the ground.

(SS)+3+4,b+2 (or f+2)
While in MED you turn around and hit him with your backfist. This will, of course, like your 
normal back fist, give you a free back throw, or you can always juggle him. A good move. 
Too my surprise this move is actually a lot safer on block than your regular f+2 backfist.

(SS)+3+4,1+4,b+1,1,1,1,1
While in MED you do hara-kiri and then the manji blood dance. Extremely flashy, ohh, ahh 
move, but other than that not so good. You end up killing yourself with this move, so if your 
not a person who likes to impress or give away wins don't do this move. There are some set-
ups for the suicide, which makes it nearly impossible to escape; I just don't like the idea of 
committing a suicide in any situation. Oh and if you do this you end up spinning the wrong 
way, which simply put means the blood dance won't hit any other than yourself, well except 
the first spin that is which will always connect if you hit him with your back turned suicide 
making this two hit combo 74 points in damage..

(SS)+3+4,2+3
While in MED you quickly do your soul siphon throw for 35 points in damage. Nice addition 
to this stance.

(SS)+3+4,2+4
While in MED you quickly do your standard sword face smash throw for 30 points in 
damage. Nice addition to this stance.

(SS)+3+4,b,3+4
Well you simply do a full backspin after entering MED, this of course leaves you in MED 
once again. Evasion move only.

(SS)+3+4,b~3+4
Well you simply do a half backspin after entering MED, this of course leaves you in MED 
once again. Evasion move only.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.5 Regular unblockables (!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will find unblockables listed in other places in this faq as well. By doing so it's kind of 
my way telling you that those moves are the high priority unblockable moves. So the reason 
you won't find extensive explanations regarding the unblockables in this particular section is 
that I have covered them elsewhere (look in my basic movelist). Also regarding the Flea 
stance I have already covered it in an earlier section and I don't see the need of writing it 
down once more. Now lets move on to the unblockable moves.

b,b+1
Yoshi's strongest unblockable. Long reach, hits mid and does serious damage. 

b,b+1~N,1 (b,b)
Sword spin. Hits mid. Stop someone running in or do this by a wall. You can cut it short by 
pressing b,b during his early spins. This can be very nice after you grounded your opponent 
with a throw.

b,b+1~N,1+2
Onimusha hunter. Yoshi tries to cut his opponent on the top of his scull. This can be done if 
someone expects the normal b,b+1 or the sword spin and rushes in on you.

D/B+1+2~any button
Death pose and the poison breath. A very good move.

d,d/f,f+1
The moonsault slayer. Get people that are on a distance right after or during a rise from a 
knockdown. Easily sidestepped though. Still this can be very useful as a part of your distance 
game.

FC,b+1 or FC,d/f+1
The low sword slice. Well that's just what it is. Trips on hit with juggle options afterwards.

d+1(~N,D/B)
It your regular sword slice. Hits mid and can be stalled to make out as much as 107 points in 
damage (Yoshi takes six steps forward and his sword starts to flash).

d+1+2
Cyclone lift. This juggles on CH and hits grounded opponents.

d+1+4
Harakiri. Yoshi commits suicide. Do you really need more info on this move?

d+1+4,B+1,1,1,1,1
Harakiri to the manji blood dance. It's your blood he's dancing on not your opponent. Spin 
around with a sword in your belly and fall over due to the effort. Looks very painful. This can 
of course work well against walls.

f,f+1+4
Suicide. Yoshi runs up, turns around and stabs himself in the belly hopefully hitting your 
opponent in the gut as well. Looks very painful indeed. Try using this on people that tend to 
backroll a lot.

f,f+1+4~f,f
Double suicide. Same as above, but now Yoshi stabs himself in the gut twice. If you got a 
death wish this is your move, if not stay away from it.

u/f+1+2
Deathcopter. Fly high in the air before coming down with a sword slice. Hits grounded 
opponents. You can cut this move short by pressing D while airborne. If you press B you will 
turn around 180 degrees in the air before coming down.

1+4
Sword flash. Stop a move and steal it. Need I say more, wink wink, now what I mean.

1+2+3
Spirit shield. Works like the one above except no damage, no stealing and the animation takes 
too long. If you ever use this move it will be strictly showing off.

d/f+3,1
The wood cutter. A good move. A lunging leg first, then the sword.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.5 Throws
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Throws are vital in T-4. If you don't use throws you are neglecting what the game has to 
offer. Many throws are really cool to watch and they are always nice when someone is used to 
being bullied and just stand there guarding what think is a incoming punch/kick.


Run and throw is a simple teqnique that newbees tend to use a lot. It is still a highly efficient 
style from time to time. Just run up to someone who is expecting an attack and is on the 
defence and throw them to the ground for okizeme options.

If you manage to integrate throws in your mix-ups and custom string you will be a though 
player to beat. Now on to Yoshi's throws.

2+4 Sword face smash. Hit your opponent in the face with the shaft of your sword. Be sure to 
do a wake up game or some okizemes if you can after this.

F+2+4 Devious plot. This is sweet. You grab your enemy, flip him around and stab him in a 
most brutal way right in the chest. It's only 30 points in damage which I feel is wrong for 
such a brutal throw, it should be 40. Still very, very cool indeed.

d,d/b,b+1+2 Rainbow drop. This is Yoshi's best throw. It makes out 39 points in damage and 
can only be escaped by pressing 1+2. Use this throw. Try this after a normal 1 punch for 
instance. If you get this throw in try to hit him on the ground with d+1.

d,d/f,f+2 Soul siphon. If you connect this you will gain 16 life bar points and your enemy 
looses 22 points. If however he presses 1+2 to escape the throw will not be broken, but he will 
regain 22 points and you will loose 16 points. This throw looks real sweet if you grab them 
from behind and lift them up by the neck for some extra damage, its inescapable and the cool 
animation is definitely worth it.

d,d/b,b,f+2 Soul Possesion. It looks like the one above, but if you ever do this it's most likely 
by mistake. Anyway YOU take 35 points in damage and your opponent receives 26 points.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 Moves, tactics and follow-ups
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To have a plan when you are fighting is of utmost importence. Always try to tell the future 
and have some sort of set-up plan ready in your mind. When you hit someone be sure to 
follow it up as soon as possible.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1 When the announcer says FIGHT!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You all probably know by now that T-4 is a jabbers friendly game.  People will usually try to 
bulldog you from the get-go. I've listed some of the moves I normally start a fight with.

SS+4 On CH this stuns, giving you juggle options.

SS+1 A very nice match opener. Dodge high and some mid attacks and punch him in the belly 
with the sword shaft. Don't be afraid to abuse this move.

SS Just a simple sidestep. It gives you plenty of options if timed correctly.

1,2,(1) Yoshi will out-jab almost anyone from the get go, so why not?

U/F Hop over. This will work quite often. You simply hop over your opponent and kick him 
in the back as soon as you land.

FC,d/f+1 The low sword sweep. Finish the D,d/f motion before the announcer says fight and 
do this move right away. If it connects you have some high damage juggle options. See juggle 
chapter for more.

FC,D,d/f+3 The lunging sweep kick. Finish the D,d/f motion before the announcer says fight. 
Works just like the low sword sweep giving you juggle/okizeme options on hit. You have 
easy and tougher juggles after this, always do one of them. See juggle chapter for more.

d+2 A simple quick mid punch can stop even the toughest players out there. Follow up with 
the low sword sweep, the lunging sweep kick or a quick rising uppercut (WS+1+2).

FC,d+1 or d/b+1 or FC,d/f+1 Works just like the one above, only two frames quicker I think.

FC,N,u/f+3 From crouch you quickly do the rising knee kick which gives you juggle options. 
See juggle chapter for more. This works if your opponent is expecting a low move.

(f)+3 The spin kick. This snags sidesteppers so if you expect someone to SS do this.

d+3+4,N,f You go straight into the Indian sit stance and pop up behind him with some frame 
advantage(?). If this works it's due to the deer in headlights effect. Your opponent is dazzled 
by your nerve for even trying such a funny move as a match opener, just long enough for you 
to disappear in the ground and come out behind him. Use this for flashy openings against 
semi-good players, but not too much.

1+3 The soul stealer. Well this is just fun to do. Dash in before you hear fight to show 
aggressiveness and then flash him. It has all the right properties to start a match with (except 
for no damage that is), it's quick, stuns for a microsecond (giving you the momentum), it's 
flashy and very annoying and maybe, just maybe you even stole a move from him. If you do 
the mind games are on. He he.

u/b or u or u/f+4 Avoid the puddle. If you expect a low or special mid move throw this one 
out. But be warned if you jump over your opponent by accident he has a free back kick.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2 When fighting –bullying- 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once inside a fight there is no real strategy that can work wonders. All the moves in T-4 have 
a countermove, so if you can't surprise your pretty much doomed. Still there is some tactics 
that will work if done right, and many mix-ups can be hard to get out of once your opponent 
is inside them. Remember to check out the custom strings and mix-up chapter! In this section 
I will try to teach you how to play like a bully with Yoshi. Bullying is generally the most 
efficient way to fight in T-4 (Yoshi's turtling game is very tough though). Here are 10 simple 
rules. 

Rule # 1

Yoshi has seven ten-strings. Many might say his are not the best the game has to offer if you 
take away the flashy unblockables in them, and they are right. It is easy to stop his ten-strings, 
you just SS, jab, duck-jab or parry the first low. The low parry is by many considered to be 
the safest way out once inside them since you can retaliate 100% guaranteed afterwards. But 
he still has ONE very useful ten-string that is difficult to break out of! This particular ten-
string is also very easy to mix up with normal moves so it can be considered as your secret 
weapon when all else fails (not against expert players though). Use this once or twice in a 
match, and don't forget to mix-up the end from time to time. This normal 10 hit-string can 
also be used as a wall juggle in certain stages. 

Remember that Yoshi's 1,2,1 jabs are great, so there is nothing special that should make you 
think twice about unleashing this combo or the mix-up. Here goes:

Ten-string combo: 1,2,1,4,2,2,2,4,1,1        hits: h,m,m,h,m,m,m,m,m,l (unblockable ending)
Mix-up combo:      1,2,1,4,2,(2),(2),d+1    hits: h,m,m,h,m,(m),(m),sm (sm punch ending)

Now the ten-string combo gives you no low kick to parry, you can only break out of in in two 
places once inside the first jabs. 

1: Duck-jab right after 1,2,1 and during the high 4 kick.  
2: Wait out the combo and (duck) jab Yoshi right after the last 4 kick, before the two 
unblockables.

If your opponent don't manage to break out you can abuse this combo. If however he catches 
on and break free at the end (if you play someone good they will usually break it in the 
beginning unfortunately) the mix-up is in its place. The mix-up can only be broken by duck-
jabbing the first 4 kick. If you're doing the mix-up, and not the combo, try to finish it off with 
the low sword sweep (FC,d/f+1 or FC+b+1) or a rising knee (u/f+3) or a simple SS+1. You 
recover while crouching from the last low 1 punch which makes the low sword sweep flow 
very well, almost like a small ten-string on it's own. You can however be out (duck) jabbed 
right after the special mid punch and before the low sword sweep.


Rule # 2

You should be trying to make a set-up for either your low sword sweep (FC,d/f+1), your 
lunging sweep kick (FC,d/f+3) or your rising knee (u/f+3) at all times. All these three moves 
give you good juggle options and are considered safe moves due to speed and priority, of 
course when it comes to the sword sweep it is not so quick, but unblockable. Try a normal 
1,(2) punch and quickly do either the lunging sweep kick or the low sword sweep. Or SS, 
duck jab or just duck and then do the rising knee.


Rule # 3

When fighting someone using kicks a lot (Bob, Lee) you can use the bad stomach stance and 
the poison breath as a punishing move if your jabs usually miss. This stuns, hits high takes 25 
points in damage and gives you some nasty juggle/okizme options.


Rule # 4

When fighting someone using a lot of quick punches and you find yourself blocking for an 
eternity (Steve) you must flash them with 1+4 (the soul stealer). You now have gained 
momentum and maybe even stole a move from your opponent. Try a normal F+3 kick that 
snags sidesteppers after this one hits. Or go in your own jabbing game with the ten-hit combo 
or some set-ups for a sweep or a launcher.


Rule # 5

When fighting someone who goes low a lot you must go into the flea stance (1+2) to stop 
them cold at the spot. If this hits press another 1+2 for extra damage. Also the soul stealer 
(1+4), the sword slice (d+1) and the Cyclone lift (d+1+2) can be useful here. If playing 
against Christie you can sometimes do the whole Poison wind to stonefist to poison wind 
combo on her when she's dancing: u/f+3+4,b+1,3+4 Or try the Poison wind to stonefist to 
manji flip to sword slice: u/f+3+4,b+1,4,d/b+1 If you hold D/B at the end you will load up 
your sword more and more for each step forward you take.


Rule # 6

When your opponent is grounded you must hit him with your sword (d+1 or d+1+2). If he is 
grounded near a wall you can do the sword spin (b~b+1,N,1) or the running flea 
(1+2,U,N,f,f). By the way, you can cut the sword spin short by pressing b~b while it's 
spinning. Nice little addition to the move. Of course the poison wind combos are also useful 
as okizemes.


Rule # 7

Avoid high hits by going in the indian sit stance and retaliate with 1 or 2 or disappear by 
pressing F. Doesn't work every time. If the disappearing act works kick him (with 3) in the 
back or launch him with your step-in uppercut d/f+2. If these moves don't connect for some 
reason try the lunging low sweep or the wood cutter. If you decide to press 1 for the quick 
Indian moonsault slayer try to follow up a hit with u/f+3. After the moonsault hits no one has 
the frame advantage so jabbing can work well if they get you when you are going for the 
u/f+3.


Rule # 8

When your running in on someone on the ground stop in front of them and do the low sword 
sweep (FC,d/f+1) or lunging sweep kick (FC,d/f+3), but only if you expect them to try 
anything else than just lying still. If they lie still press d+1 (the sword slice), d+1+2 (the 
cyclone lift) or one of the poison wind combos. If you run in on backrollers try the samurai 
knee (u/f+3) and against techrollers the low sword sweep can be very useful.


Rule # 9

The wood cutter (d/f+3,1) is a Yoshi friendly move. If the leg connects the sword is 
guaranteed. This move will hit quite often. Hits m,m. After this hits follow up with u/f+3, 
FC,d/f+1 or FC,d/f+3 which all gives you juggle options. Unfortunately this move does not 
give you enough time to go on a jabbing frenzy, so make up your mind first, should I continue 
attacking (unsafe) or just go in block mode (safer). Also this can be SS or you can be 
outjabbed in between the kick and the slice so you might consider only doing the lunging foot 
and not the sword.


Rule # 10

The final rule of bulldogging Yoshi is. Steal moves and use them against your opponent. This 
is what makes Yoshi so fun to play with in the first place. Stolen moves work quite often as 
juggle enders as well. Also if you have stolen a mach punch from Bryan and retaliated with it, 
he will think twice before he does another mach punch. And we all know that people that 
think don't attack, so now you are on the offence and he's on the defence.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.3 When fighting –Turtling- 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yoshi is the best turtler there is in T-4. He doesn't have any reversals, but he dont really need 
it with the extremely fast soul stealer, the flea stance and the bad stomach stance. All these 
moves have the right properties to make Yoshi a great turtler. Here are 10 rules to remember 
when turtling.

Rule # 1

When someone is running in on you from the other side of the screen for that unblockable 
tackle – flash èm.


Rule # 2

When someone is trying to get you from a distance with a power move like Heiachi's Iron fist 
or King's Black shoulder flash èm or hit them on the CH with fubuki (f,f+4).


Rule # 3

When you are caught up in strings (Hwoa, Lei) or mix-ups (Steve, Ling) – flash èm or d/b+1.


Rule # 4

If someone whiffs a power move– flash and steal it, still whiffed moves are the best openings 
you can get so a normal f+3 kick can of course be very useful as well. 

Rule # 5

If someone goes low press1+2,U,N,1+2 The flea stance and the flea headbutt.


Rule # 6

Duck high hits and throws in a heated battles with the Bad stomach stance and poison breath 
to get this unblockable hit in every time. Always try to follow up with a juggle.


Rule # 7

Yoshi's "Ha-Ha step" Yoshi can do a "fast" escape by doing his Ha-Ha Step. What happens is 
that Yoshi goes into MED and cancelles this by pressing B, he then goes into MED once 
again and so on and so on. The breakdown is: 3+4,b,3+4,b,3+4. What you see is Yoshi 
quickly going in MED, turns around while backing up, goes in MED once again and so on.
You of course don't need to use the Ha-Ha step to make moves whiff you can also do this 
little trick as an evasion move (SS)+3+4,3+4,d+3+4 Here Yoshi sits down in IND at the end 
and you make your opponent whiff a move. If you decide to only do the 3+4,b,d+3+4 you will 
be sitting in IND facing your opponent, from where you can press 2 for quick retaliation. 
(Thanx goes out to Tenshimitsu's great Yoshi faq for reminding me of some of these moves) 
If someone approaches you while you're in BT a normal 3 or 4 kick will hit him hard and is to 
be considered a "safe" move from BT.

Rule # 8

If you're caught up against a wall try not to panic. Normally you must play as a bully for a 
small time to get away from the wall. Still the flash can stop many bullies that tryes to keep 
you cornered. Just flash and SS+1 and you should be safe again.

Rule # 9

Use the SS+1 to annoy and keep punishing your opponent. You are completely safe after this 
move hits.

Rule # 10

Use your life regaining abilities when opportunity seems fit.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4 When fighting –Match enders- 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To end a match in a safe way is essential to T-4. Even if your playing in a fight where it looks 
like your goanna end it perfect your opponent only needs to regain momentum to turn the 
tables. Don't let yourself become the hunted. Here are four simple rules.


Rule # 1

Go low. Well it's as cheap as it is simple. Always go for that cheesy last low hit that finishes 
him off.


Rule # 2

Use your unblockables. The sword slice (d+1) is a safe way to end a match right along with 
the wood cutter (d/f+3,1) and the poison breath.


Rule # 3

b+1,1,d/b+3,3,f+4 This is a nice little pressure string. It hit's h,h,l,l,m and knocks down with 
the last kick. Many people have some troubles blocking the first low in this string; this makes 
it the perfect match ender.

Rule # 4

SS+1 is a great move that also is considered safe and has high damage. Always think of this 
move at the end of matches.

Ps. Throws are always nice match enders.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.5 When fighting –Walls-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The excellent addition of walls in T-4 is what makes this game so very different than others. 
Every player has some high damage wall combos, wall stunning moves, wall push follow-ups 
and can escape from a corner/wall by pressing b~b~u/b.

High power characters like Heiachi will usually go for something like two times the Iron fist 
by the wall for easy heavy damage, while others like Lee likes to kick you multiple times after 
a wall stun. Now being Yoshimitsu you have some GREAT wall combos. If you ever corner 
your opponent there is really only one thing that should be on your mind –GET THAT 
DAMN WALL STUN AND FINISH HIM OFF- Well here's how I do it –this works near any 
kind of walls (yes even on Arena), but a cornered opponent is the easiest target-


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.6 How to stun by walls
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you trap someone against a wall you have a couple of options to stun him:

1: (F)+3 This stuns very nicely and sets you up for another spin kick that gives you nice 
damage, or you can go for a personal high damage wall combo.

2: A simple wall push will give you the time needed to start all the ten-hit combos that begin 
with 1,2 It's cheap, but efficient from time to time. This isn't really a wall combo or anything, 
but it is an easy way of inflicting damage by walls. You can also do this after a wall push: 
f+2,f+2+4. Simply do the backhand slap and then grab him from behind, but this is not a 
guaranteed combo or anything, just a set-up for you to get him back turned by the wall. You 
can easily do almost any move after the backhand slap so you can always go for some kicks 
instead.

3: Go in your bad stomach stance and blow that poison breath on him, he's now all yours to 
do whatever you please. This just might be your # 1 wall combo starter. I know I like it.

4:  Almost any launcher, yes that's right. You can stun your opponent near wall with a simple 
d/f+2. It's quick reliable and hits mid. Not great damage, but you get the stun. This is the 
easiest and maybe even the best way to get a wall stun.

5: If you have cornered someone and they go into some special low stance or just duck you 
can wall stun them by doing your rising knee. u/f+3.

6: Avoid the puddle u/f+4 will avoid lows and give you a wall stun. Be warned though, this 
only works when you have the wall to your right side. Still a very good move as it seems to 
hit quite often.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.7 Follow-ups and juggles from the wall stun.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1: (F)+3,3 A simple move, this is what normally comes out after a wall stun. It gives nice 
damage and is easy to execute. If you are playing with Yoshi chances is that your already 
doing this after the stun.

2: (F)+4,4,(4) Another easy-to-do wall combo. The last kick seem to miss a lot so I 
recommend you only do the first two kicks and then some okizeme move.

3: His ten-hit combo. In certain stages this works better than others. If you get the feel of it 
you can successfully do this combo after a wall stun and keep him in the air during the whole 
combo. If you are wondering what ten-hit combo you should use look at rule # 1 in the 
bullying chapter.

4: 1+2,N,f,f You go in the Flea stance and "run" forward while riding your sword.
I saved the best for last you might say. This is your ultimate wall punishment move. It is very 
easy to do and you get about 70-90 points in damage (or even higher if timed properly) all 
depending on what move you stunned him with. Now you will not always get in this whole 
wall combo (depending on your positioning, you should be right between him and the wall –
not on one of his sides, in that case the ten-string or the ballerina kicks will do just fine I 
think), but often enough for you to try it almost every time. The damage is just too great to 
overlook. 

*The Flea sword slice and the running flea's special properties!*

Stun your opponent by the wall and see him crumple to the ground. Now press 1+2 to go in 
the flea stance and you now see him fall down straight at your sword –remember that the 
longer you let him slide down the edge of your sword the greater the damage, that's why the 
N input and the stalling of the f,f input is so important-  It is also very important that you 
remember that the sooner you press 1+2 and mount your sword after the wall stun, the longer 
your enemy will slide down that sharp edge receiving even higher damage. Now as he hits the 
ground and bounces off your sword he will be tossed back at the wall, this is where you 
unleash the running flea and do some MAJOR damage. Actually I feel that the running flea 
move was created especially for those wall stun combos only since it just plain sucks in 
damage and is extremely hard to connect (even on grounded opponents) outside walls. 
Somewhat like Jin's special, ultra-flashy, Soul Rage 8-hit combo. Well except for the fact that 
Jin's move doesn't suck outside walls, it just rules bigtime near walls.

There is also an easier way of inflicting high damage by walls with the Flea and the flea 
runner. After the stun you quickly mount your sword. Now as soon as he sits on top of it press 
and hold U. You will see Yoshis wings move in an insect like way, this is his way of telling 
you your sword is loaded. If this hits it makes out 30 damage points. Now as soon as it hits 
cancel the sword load by pressing N. Yoshi now regains his sword powers after the last hit 
and thereby inflicting another 20 points in damage. As your opponent bounces off your sword 
you press f,f to run him down for additional 37 points in damage. This hurts as hell. The 
breakdown for the sword load, cancel and running flea is. 1+2~U,N,f,f. There you go, 
Tekkens coolest wall juggle if you ask me. If you stun with the poison breath this should 
make out over 100 damage points. (thanx to tenshimitsu's great yoshi faq). If you find that it 
is hard to connect all this try this easier way instead: 1+2,U,f,f. What you do is simply to skip 
the neutral input and go straight for the running flea after the sword load. 

The other day I was toying around on practice mode and I stunned Paul by the wall at arena 
with the poison breath, I then went directly to flea~flea load~flea cancel and finally the 
running flea. Now I managed to combo all but the running flea, the damage before the 
running flea was 84 points! And for some reason the running flea itself made out over 40 
points this time, not it's usual 39 points. Well this is just an example on how much damage 
you actually can do with this move, if successful this will connect for over 120 damage points 
and if done up close and at it's fastest it is unescapable. If this is done too slow it can be 
techrolled.


*Now if you are just scrolling thru this document STOP READING NOW! Have you 
stopped? Good, now look above and see what I just wrote about wall combos. It will kill your 
opponent in a flashy way!*


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.8 Mix-ups and custom strings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Well I finally added a mix-up chapter of it's own. Now you will not find all my mix-ups here, 
many are written down somewhere above so try reading the moves section if you wanna find 
some more mix-ups or just recommended follow-ups. These mix-ups are not tested as far as 
frames go (just some of them), but they all stand strong in matches and have been tested in 
fights. You will be out jabbed by bullies inside some of these custom strings, but as far as 
Tekken goes one have to take some risks to be a killer player, without taking any risks you 
will only be jabbing and duck jabbing for minimal damage, and even this is not without taking 
some kind of risks since you easily can be sidestepped out of d/b+1's.

My fighting style is very uncommon at least when looking at the players I usually play 
against, they all have custom strings and certain set-ups to launch throw or whatever. My style 
is I have no style you might say (I like to anyway) and I always try to adjust to whomever I'm 
playing against. When facing a bully I play as one myself, and when facing a turtler I play a 
mean turtle game myself. When having this kind of no-style style you soon find that many 
custom strings works wonders against some and never-ever even hit even once on someone 
else. If you find that some strings don't work against this and this player you should try as 
hard as you can to play in a completely different way using other set-ups and mixing up your 
moves and hiding them the best way possible.

The string and mix-ups here are only some of what Yoshi actually can do. He is like one huge 
puzzle where the pieces slowly forms into a picture (a picture of very sophisticated set-ups 
that is) where he's true skills will show. He is truly a space ninja with his many spaced out 
set-ups and custom strings.

*NOTE: If you switch the WS+1 with the WS+1+2 you will move somewhat forward and 
keep the pressure higher, the frames are not that different from each other in these two moves 
they just have some different properities (WS+1 is good against bullies and WS+1+2 is better 
against active blockers). So if you whiff your d/b+1,WS+1 a lot try to do d/b+1,WS+1+2 
instead. This is many times the better option of your three while standing up from crouch 
uppercuts (WS+1, WS+1+2, WS+2). In many, if not all, of the mix-ups listed here you can 
use the WS+1+2 instead of the WS+1 –have I said it enough now? - sure hope so.*


d/b+1,WS+1,d/f+1,2~D/B+2(,2)~u/f+3
This one has become one of my personal favourites after I discovered how good and 
confusing this custom string actually is. What you see is a normal left special mid punch, 
followed by a simple while standing left uppercut, if it hits I then go straight in the start of the 
door knocker and into the manji slaps. Be careful so you don't get dizzy. After the manji slaps 
go for the samurai knee for some juggle options as well. This custom string will become one 
of your best friends when you get to know it. After the manji slaps you can easily do any 
move from crouch as it recovers while crouching so the possibilities here are confined only to 
your own imagination.

1+2(~U),f,f,d+3+4,3,3+4
This is a custom string I like to use when standing right over someone who's grounded (not 
by the wall, we have better options there) and is trying to roll away. Normally I choose 
between this one or a safer okizeme mix.up, this is more a wake up game than it is a okizeme. 
You should hit him with at least one of the running flea slices to have time to perform this 
string. What you see is the Flea stance, the flea sword load that cancelles into running flea that 
in it's turn cancelles into Indian sit arts. Now from Ind you do the diving bomb to kangaroo 
kicks. This string is not to be considered a safe string, you can be punished multiple ways 
when doing this so that's why I prefer this after a knockdown where you have some time to 
perform it. It also relies somewhat on some stupid slow-witted attacks from your opponent 
after he's got up on he's feet again. Remember to press d+3+4 when Yoshi his doing his 
second hop (or was it the third, I can't seem to remember) of the running flea hop slices to go 
in IND. Also the normal poison wind combos might work well in the same kind of situations.

1+2(~U),f,f,d+3+4,2,D/B+2,(2),(2),u/f+3
This is a custom string I like to use when standing right over someone who's grounded (not 
by the wall, we have other options there) and is trying to get away. You should hit him with at 
least one of the running flea slices to have time to perform this string. This string is not to be 
considered a safe string, you can be punished multiple ways when doing this that's why I 
prefer this after a knockdown so you have some time to perform it. It also relies on some 
stupid slow attacks from your opponent after he's got up on he's feet once more. What you 
see is the Flea stance, the flea sword load that cancelles into running flea that in it's turn again 
cancelles into Indian sit arts. Now from Ind you do four manji spin slaps and stop before the 
fifth that makes you dizzy, instead you do the samurai knee. If you like you can do WS+4 
instead at the end of this string as this is a tad quicker, you won't get those juggle options 
though so it's up to you.
Also one of the normal poison wind combos might work in the same kind of situations.

D/B+3,3,(3,)(3,)(3,)d+3+4,2,D/B+2,2,2,WS+4,d/f+2
Another confusing custom string. Here you start out with the low manji spin kicks and go 
straight into IND from these. You then you start up with your manji spin slaps, from this do a 
while standing up from crouch right kick and finally a normal right-hand uppercut with juggle 
options. This one is both pleasing for the eye and an efficient custom string. Still you might 
consider stopping the string before the right uppercut.

1,d/b+1,WS+1,D/B+1+2~any
Easy, safe and damaging. This is one of your simplest, yet very damaging custom strings. You 
can however be out jabbed (duck jabbed) after the while standing up left uppercut. Still when 
using this string you will often find that many people don't duck after the WS+1 and will be 
taken out by your poison breath if they continue to block. From here you get some juggle 
options also. If you find people that always duckjab after your left rising uppercut try doing a 
WS+4 right kick instead of the left upper before the poison breath. This pushes your opponent 
so far away that he won't hit you with a d/b+1, but you will hit him with your bad breath.

d/b+1,WS+4,D/B+1+2~any
Another easy set-up for the poison breath. This is a quite good string that connect surpisingly 
often. Tenshimitsus faq keeps on illuminating me and I for one believe her simply because 
that after a while rising right kick that hits, your opponent is at a perfect distance for the 
poison breath AND the f+3,3 juggle follow-up from the breath –nice one Tenshi.

1,d/b+1,FC,d/f+1
This is one of my easiest and earliest customs with Yoshi. This flows nice and the initial jabs 
are good to stop rushers and set them up for the low sword spin. A practical, easy to 
remember and easy to execute custom string.

d/b+1,WS+4,d/f+2,d/b+1,WS+1,SS+1,d/b+2(,2)~d/b+1,WS+4 – and all over again
This is a somewhat long custom string, still not that damaging as it is mainly made of high 
priority, quick, low in damage moves. The upside is that this is a quite safe custom string 
unlike many of the ones above. I still strongly advice you to not to keep up the pressure if 
your d/f+2 and/or WS+4 is blocked and your fighting against a bully. If you juggle with the 
SS+1 stop the string and do a juggle off the launch instead, of course the same thing goes for 
the right uppercut (d/f+2). In theory you should be able to do this whole custom on your 
opponent, but like communism it only works in theory due to SS, B~B, avoiding moves 
ducking and so on, the conclusion is that against a stupid jabber you might get this whole 
mix-up in on him, but against a thinking bully you won't get that far. Stop the string when 
you scence that your opponent will manage to break it.

F+2~D/B+2(,2),u/f+3 or F+2,b+1,d/f+2
Simple, efficient and extremely damaging if you juggle with the spins after this last launch or 
just is near any walls and continue the pressure. Still I have to say that the backfist (F+2) is 
blocked way too much for some reason (too slow and easy too see animation). This makes 
this string rare, but very efficient if it goes in. 

F+2~D/B+2,d+1,WS+4,d/b+1+2~any
This is another set-up for the poison breath. What you see is the backfist followed directly up 
with one of the manji spin slaps; then a special mid left punch and a rising right kick that 
pushes your opponent away from you. Finally we have the poison breath. A good custom 
string that works wonder when mixed up with all the other endings you can do out of these 
initial moves, and especially if the block the start of this mix-up, Try simply switching 
between this ending, a WS+1 to throw or a samurai knee (u/f+3).

1,SS+1,d/b+1+2~any
Well this is just another easy set up on how to get a poison breath stun in on those jabbers out 
there. If they try to retaliate after the SS+1 they usually get caught up in your poison breath 
leaving you with juggle options.

d/f+1,2~D/B+2,d/b+1,(WS+1)~d,d/b,b+1+2
Well I guess your smiling now, you didn't think I was gonna forget his throws in mix-ups 
now did you. Well throws are only as important as you make them, but I can say this for sure: 
When facing an opponent that constantly blocks your every move, parries many or all lows, 
SS out of reach and always seem to find an opening on you, then throws usually is the one 
move that can turn the tables and make you the victorious one. 
I normally use 2-6 throws in a normal VS match (100% in life and three rounds) and often I 
finish off the other player with a throw. Throws are (besides from your unblockables) 
normally the one really safe move you always can do and get away with, even if it is escaped! 
What you see here is a normal special mid left punch followed up by a while standing up from 
crouch left upper. Now it is very important that you try to do the rainbow drop throw itself as 
soon as possible after the left upper. It takes a 1+2 release button, which means that you 
probably should get away with it. If you like you can go straight for the throw after the left 
special mid punch instead.

(f)+1,D/B+2,(2),(2),(2),FC+d/f+1
What you see is a custom string that's very efficient against those people that always blocks 
your lows. It's a normal left punch (or you can start out with a backfist), then the start of the 
manji spin slaps that recover while crouching and thus giving you the perfect set-up for you 
low sword sweep. This in its turn gives you some juggle options.

B+1,d/b+1,FC+d/f+1
Okay, I stole this one from Tenshimitsus faq, but I don't feel too bad cause I have been using 
it occasionally from time to time anyway. Start off with one of the stone fists, then quickly do 
a special mid left punch and immediately after this do the low sword spin. Like the one above 
this is great if you are up against a blocker.

1,d/f+4,b~b+1,N,1,B~B
This is not safe or anything, just fun to do. After the right mid kick try a sword spin, you can 
be jabbed or even launched before the spins so this somewhat relies on your opponent 
stopping and thinking what the f**k, thus giving you time to slice and dice. After this hits try 
poison wind combos or the Flea runner for additional damage if he stays on the ground. Also 
if you want a safer string with an unblockable ending try this: 1,d/f+4,d/b+1+2~any. It is 
actually somewhat slower, but you will duck any throw attempts and high hits so therefore I 
consider it to be a safer alternative. 

d/b+1,WS+1,D/B+2,(2),(2),(2),WS+1,SS+1,b+1,1,D/B+3,3,f+4
Another long mix-up. Look over this one and check out the properties of it.  If the WS+1 hits 
normal or duckers the D/B+2 takes over any jabs as your opponent only has 5 frames of 
freedom. You can do multiple manji spin slaps but I recommend only doing one of them, by 
only doing one this makes your next WS+1 untouchable as your opponent only has 7 frames 
of freedom, during these 7 frames all he can do is block or try to sidestep you, any retaliation 
from his side will lead to you hitting him on the counterhit. If the following WS+1 hits normal 
or duckers the SS+1 ties with a 8 frame jab, if the SS+1 hits normal b+1 ties with a 8 frame 
jab (if you manage to connect this that is). All these little fact makes this a quite safe (not 
untouchable or anything, but just quite safe) custom string and mix-up. When you finally start 
up with the stone fists to manji spin kicks to a manji while rising right kick you can skip the 
last kick and instead go straight into IND by pressing d+3+4 during the d/b+3,3 spins instead. 
From here you can start your offensive guessing game over again by pressing 
2,D/B+2,(2),(2),(2),d/f+3 or something else. 

NOTE: In theory you should be able to do this whole custom on your opponent, but like 
communism it only works in theory due to SS, B~B, avoiding moves ducking and so on, the 
conclusion is that against a stupid jabber you might get this whole mix-up in on him, but 
against a thinking bully you won't get that far. Stop the string when you scense that your 
opponent will manage to break it.

As you probably have already seen there are many special mid left punches and quick 
recovery moves like WS+1 or WS+1+2 in these strings and mix-ups. In Tekken 4 you will 
need to use those "small" moves a lot to gain the advantage over the fight. Once you have 
momentum on your side you can go on your true offence using somewhat more long recovery 
moves with higher damage potential. Even if you find a string that connect on all hits and you 
think it is completely safe on block (at least against this one player) please don't do the same 
string once more, do another one instead. Reason for this is simply that you do not want to 
give your opponent the chance of learning and memorizing places to block and retaliate inside 
your strings. So wait one round or two and then surprise him with it once more. For instance, 
if you constantly get out jabbed after d/f+2 try to do this: d/f+2,d/b+1+2~any to avoid all 
highs hits and then stun and surprise him. This specific way of fighting also goes under the 
name baiting technique, when you learn to bait (mind reading) you WILL become a very 
efficient player.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7 Juggles
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Juggles are generally the safest way of inflicting damage (you have those unblockables 
though). Basically you just hit your enemy while he's floating in the air or is stunned. This is 
by many considered to be the safest tactic there is in T-4. What you do is bait/fight until you 
get an opening to launch him. Now playing with Yoshi this is not to hard. He's launchers have 
such high priority that they will soon be an integrated part of your gameplay, even if you 
don't juggle of the launchers they can be efficient.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.1 Normal juggle starters and juggles
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The low sword sweep and my three main juggles:

FC,d/f+1~F+3,3 
It's the low sword sweep followed by the ballerina kick. 48 points in damage, 52 on the CH. 
You should not always do this juggle after the sweep. This juggle will not connect from the 
side so it won't work every time. You might have some juggles that connect if you get him 
from the side, but who cares right? I tried to find one, but had no luck. If you find a juggle 
that works from the side e-mail me okay and I'll be sure to post it. If you hit him from the side 
you can always go for some okizeme moves instead of a juggle. This won't hit Paul for some 
reason; try going for the poison wind to flea instead. If Paul escapes this (by a rising low 3 
kick) next time you know this and instead just go straight in flea. I'm sorry, but I don't have 
any high damage guarantees on Paul after this move.

FC,d/f+1~d/f+1,1,1
OH HAPPY DAY! Well I finally found the better juggle off the sword sweep! Too my 
surprise my brother told me the other day that he connected the door knocker after the low 
sword sweep, well I tried it and found out that not only does it nearly as much damage as the 
regular oni-kick combo (ballerina kicks –3,3-), but it is actually a much more secure juggle. 
And it leaves you with very nice 100% guaranteed okizeme options as well. Oh and this 
juggle will connect even against Paul. It won't connect if you do it from the side 
unfortunately. Still this is a safe juggle and I now prefer this too the one above.

FC,d/f+1~D/B+1,f,f+4
And here you have the one juggle that always will connect on anyone anytime. From facing 
the opponent from straight forward or from any side, it doesn't matter as this will connect 
anyway. It doesn't have high damage, but it makes up for this in its safety and simplicity. If 
you are getting tired of whiffing the two juggles above do this one for 100% guaranteed 
damage instead. Leaves you with wake-up game options or okizeme.


The Lunging sweep kick and my three main juggles:

FC,d/f+3,WS+4,d/f+1,2 
The lunging sweep kick is followed up with a while rising right kick, once you get him 
airborne with this you immediately do the door knocker to backhand slap. This makes out 33 
points in easy damage, nice near walls where you can get other options afterwards. If you feel 
like it you can try to connect the d+1,N~D/B after the juggle. Just make sure that you take at 
least one step forward to close in on your opponent when loading up your sword before 
hitting him with it. If you like tech roll traps try this: 
FC,d/f+3,WS+4,d/f+1,2,d/b+2,2,FC+d/f+1

FC,d/f+3,WS+4,d+1 
The lunging sweep kick is followed up with a while rising right kick, once you get him 
airborne with this you immediately do the regular sword slice. This should connect before he 
hits the ground, tossing him up and away from you, hopefully near a wall. This makes out 41 
points in damage (45 on CH) and is your safest and easiest juggle from the lunging sweep 
kick.

FC,d/f+3,WS+4,u/f+3+4,b+1,1+2 
The lunging sweep kick is followed up with a while rising right kick, once you get him 
airborne with this you immediately do the Poison wind to backhand to poison wind combo. If 
all connects you get 50 in damage, 54 on CH. This is really über-sweet. I mean how often do 
you connect the lunging sweep kick, almost every time. There you go, you now can snuff 
someone out in no time at all if you always manage to connect this juggle. Hell, even the best 
players out there will fall for the sweep kick at one point or another. The downside of this 
juggle is that you'll have to be extremely fast when doing the poison wind combo for it to 
actually connect as a juggle, almost like a JF move (plus it can be techrolled before the last 
hit). This, simply put, means that if you don't do it quick enough and your opponent tech-
rolled at once (and they always will too since they fall down at a perfect tech-rolling distance 
for them to get away) you will spin away from them giving them the chance to retaliate 
bigtime. Still if this connects it just might be Yoshi's coolest juggle/okizeme so it's worth 
going for it if you are a crowd pleaser, or just a Tekken maniac who always manages to 
connect this juggle. I don't connect it every time, but because of it's so flashy and high in 
damage I always keep it in the back of my mind and throw it out once in a while.


The rising knee and my four main juggles:

u/f+3,1,d/f+3,1
The rising knee is followed up by a simple jab and then the wood cutter. It's a simple juggle 
that will connect every time you try it. I still use the one below more.

u/f+3,1,b+1,1,1,1,1,N,F+3,(3)
The rising knee is followed up by a simple jab and then the stone fists; and finally your 
normal spin kick or the ballerina kicks. I like this juggle cause you move your opponent over 
very large areas. If you finish it with near a wall you will connect with both kicks for extra 
damage, nice. It's a little tricky managing this juggle every time and the damage is not great, 
but acceptable. If your having troubles with this juggle do the one below or the one over 
instead. Oh, and if you have stolen a move try using it as a juggle ender instead of the F+3 
kick.

u/f+3,1,b+1,1,1,1,1,N,u/f+3
The rising knee is followed up by a simple jab, then the stone fists; and finally another rising 
knee. Not too much damage, but very annoying for your opponent. Plus you travel serious 
distances with this juggle, hopefully ending it near a wall for additional damage.

u/f+3,1,d/f+,1,1,1,d/f+3 (or D/F+3 –the normal sweeping kick)
If all connect (they usually do) you get 47 points in damage. If he tries to roll away at the end 
you get 51 points in damage. What you see is The rising knee is followed up by a simple jab, 
then the first three hits of the door knocker and finally a lunging sweep kick or a normal 
sweep kick (this cannot be blocked). The lunging sweep kick can unfortunately be blocked, 
but it rarely happens though.


Shrine lift and its three main juggles:

SS+2,1,d/f+3,1
This is the simplest juggle to perform and usually the one that I use. After the shrine lift you 
do a simple jab to stabilize him in the air before you follow up with the wood cutter. This 
makes out 39 points in damage.

SS+2,d/f+1,2,D/B+2,2
The shrine lift is followed up with the door knocker to backhand slap. After this hits you 
immediately follow it up with two manji spin slaps. 39 points in damage, but you recover 
faster from this juggle than the one above. (thanx to Tenshimitsu for this juggle)

SS+2,d/f+1,1,d+1
The shrine lift is followed up with the two first punches in the door knocker and then you 
immediately do the normal sword slice. Without the sword slice this makes out 36 points in 
damage. (thanx to Tenshimitsu for this juggle)


Other launchers and juggles:

1+2,3+4,b~b,f+3,3
First you go in flea, then you do the Kangaroo kick from flea and finally the ballerina kicks. 
This makes out 58 points in damage and is an easy juggle. Your camera angle will not be 
funky after the kangaroo kick like with a normal 4~3 and the juggles here are much easier. 
Just remember to tap back before the ballerina kicks or you'll miss.

4~3~N~U,f+3,3
What you see is the kangaroo kick followed up with the ballerina kicks. This makes out 58 
points in damage. When you do the normal ballerina kicks your camera angle will be very 
funky, for a second it seems that back is forward and then back again. It's easy to miscalculate 
the juggles due to this fact. I managed to find a easy way to work around it though. When you 
hit him with the kangaroo kicks, press N, then press U right after the N input. Now you 
simply press F (remember that F means forward to where he stood before you launched him) 
and HOLD F. After holding F for something that in battles feels like an eternity you calmly 
press 3,3 for both ballerina kicks to hit. This is the easiest way of knowing you'll track him in 
the air instead of doing your moves behind his back. I suggest you get used to this method or 
try to find some juggles that you don't need the directional buttons to perform.

d/f+2,b+1,1,1,1,1,F+3,(3)
This launches your opponent so high that you don't need to stabilize him in the air before 
doing the stonefists. It doesn't do high damage, but it moves your opponent over large areas. I 
believe this makes out 38 points in damage. However since this launches so high you can do 
almost any other juggle you feel like after it hits. You can of course stop inside the spins and 
start them up again before your opponent hits the ground to travel even further distances, or as 
a simple but damaging wall juggle.


Countherhit juggles:

CH SS+1,1,d/f+3,1
Another easy to perform juggle. This is 44 points in damage. After launch you stabilize your 
floating opponent by pressing 1, then you do the wood cutter.

CH SS+1,d/f+1,2,D/B+2,2,D/F+3
This is my favourite juggle of the Inner palm. It totals with 49 points in damage and is not that 
hard to do. After launch do the start of the door knocker, go into the manji spin slaps and then 
finally a low sweep kick (not lunging sweep kick).

CH SS+1,1,d/f+1,1,1
This is a bit more tricky than the one above, but not hard or anything. After launch you 
stabilize your floating opponent by pressing 1, then you do the first three hits of the door 
knocker. This makes out 48 points in damage. Try connecting a low sweep kick after this or 
just one of the poison wind combos.

7.2 Stun juggles
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is fun. When you learn to juggle of stuns you become the deadly player everyone fear to 
fight against. You have fought a match against a good Kazuya haven't you? Well if you have, 
you know you should fear moves that stun. Yoshi don't have those badass juggles out of stuns 
like Kazuya, but he's still a better stun juggler than many others.


The poison breath juggles and the Flea cutter special properties. Check out the flea cutters 
properties below to learn more about it's special ways of inflicting damage.

D/B+1+2~any button,1+2,N,1+2
This makes out 47 points in damage, 51 on CH. The moves you see are your poison breath 
followed up with the flea stance and finally the scull splitter. This juggle only works at very 
close range (0-1), if you are further away the whole juggle WILL whiff. Remember that the 
longer you let him slide down the edge of your sword the greater the damage, that's why the 
N input and stalling the second 1+2 input is so important. It is also very important you 
remember that the sooner you press 1+2 and mount your sword after the poison breath the 
longer your enemy will slide down that sharp edge, this meaning you'll inflict even higher 
damage. If you do this juggle at it's fastest I think you'll end up with about 33 lousy points in 
damage. In this particular juggle stalling the late moves are extremely important to make the 
full 47 points combo. It's not hard when you get the hang of it. Oh and you can connect a 
f,f+4 after this juggle for additional 6 points in damage if your quick. 

D/B+1+2~any button,1+2~U
This actually makes out 49 points in damage, 55 if it doesn't connect as a juggle (very nice for 
a two hit combo). This will only work at distance 0-1. What you do is the poison breath 
followed up with the Flea stance, and immediately after entering flea you start loading your 
sword. Your enemy will be hit and tossed away by the increased power in your sword. It takes 
somewhat exact timing, but it's really not any harder than the one above –looks cooler too if 
you ask me.

D/B+1+2~any button,F+3,3
The poison breath once again, but now you follow it up with the ballerina kick. I think you 
have to hold F before and during the ballerina kick in order to hit with both. This also makes 
out 47 points in damage, 51 on the CH. This is your main juggle out of the poison breath, but 
it will only work at distance 1-2. Luckily this is where you usually use it. If you do the poison 
breath up close (range 0-1) the ballerina kick will whiff giving your opponent time to get up. 
Learn when to use this juggle and when to use the one above. It gets easier after a while.

SS+4 (on CH) Well, basically you have the same options as a poison breath that hits from 
range1-2. This means you could -and should- do the ballerina (f+3,3) kick as a stun juggle. 
You can of course also dash in and go in flea, load your sword or just headbutt him for about 
the same damage I think. The breakdown here is:  (CH),SS+4,f,f~B,N,1+2~U (or N,1+2)

8 VS the Soul stealer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Yoshi has the ability to steal moves from your opponent. Now at first I didn't use this move a 
lot simply because I didn't realised it's wonderful properties. It is extremely useful. It will for 
instance break Jin's 1,2,3 pressure string bullshit right in between the 2 and the 3 input (!) 
AND steal this string! If this doesn't convince you to start using it at least as a defensive 
move and a set-up for strings, throws and juggles I just don't now what will. How about 
breaking Law's 1,2,3,1,2,3 pressure string – does that help? Also the soul stealer is the fastest 
move in the game.

I've made a small list of some of the most useful moves you can steal; now Yoshi can steal so 
many moves and use them in so many different situations (strings/mix-
ups/juggles/okizemes/juggle starters) that the soul stealer should be considered one of your 
greatest weapons.

*Note: If you see a move you can steal that's marked with (  ) it means that the input here is 
not necessary for you to steal the entire string.*

*Note: Stolen moves will be executed as fast as possible. This simply means that you should 
be somewhat close when using moves like Jin's f,d,d/f+2 too avoid whiffing it, the same goes 
for ducking and SS moves in which the initial SS many times looks as it disappears*

Yoshimitsu VS Jin

First I feel have too say that I do NOT find Jin to be so cheesy as everyone else seem to think 
he is. All characters in Tekken are very well balanced and if they have some quick power 
moves it is simply because they need it to survive. I play quite a bit with Jin and even if he is 
somewhat boring he is also a fun character too learn if you don't only rely on quick pokes and 
bullying, but use some more mind-games and baiting techniques as well. You should not be 
scared facing the Jin-man, you can beat him as quick as he can beat you. I think that the 
reason for him being so powerful and quick is a fine mix-up of his devil genes and Mishima 
genes.

Okay now let's get going. When facing Jin you must expect constant pressure throughout the 
entire match. You might get frustrated because often your most intelligent set-ups just won't 
work on him. Jin relies on quick, mostly linear poking tools and the occasional outburst of 
high power weapons like his right JF-uppercut and the JF Laser scraper. Jin doesn't care if he 
takes some damage since he's style compels to a straight up beat èm down quick bullying 
kind of mentality. So when Jin is fighting against Yoshi he can easily control the match if you 
let him, or if you just start thinking about your set-ups and strings for too long. You must 
usually play like Jin when facing him, using a lot of quick pokes and kicks to chip away on 
his healthbar. Try using a lot of SS in between your hits cause many of his most used up close 
moves don't snag sidesteppers. SS+1 and the flash are two very helpful things against Jin. 

If Jin constantly keeps pressuring you with mids and highs like the 1,2 and 2,1 and d/f+1,(4,4) 
and of course he's 1,2,4 and the1,2,3 set-up string you usually should sidestep to your left. 
After the sidestep go for a d/f+2, a SS+1, a SS+4, a normal duck or a flash, or simply just 
press d/b+1 to poke to annoy him. If you SEE the 1,2,4  or 1,2,3 string coming at you either 
sidestep to your left or flash and steal it and stop Jin cold right in between his 2 and the 3 (or 
between 2 and 4) input (right punch to any kick). Remember too either kick with 3, SS+1, 
1,2,1 or just a d/f+2 after you stopped him with the flash if you want to go on an offence, if 
not just turtle some more. It shouldn't be too hard stealing this (1,2,3) string, due too it's 
power and high priority almost all Jin players will want too use this at least a couple of times 
in a VS match (three rounds), even if it's main use is in juggles. Once you have stolen the 
move and gained momentum go on a short custom string frenzie with a set-up for either the 
u/f+3, d/b+1+2~any or the low sword sweep at the end of your string. I often pretend that I 
simply have forgotten that I have stolen a move or just fake it so it seems that I never use the 
flash as an offence, so normally I wait before unleashing the stolen move. Stolen moves have 
a strange effect on opponents as well. Many starts to turtle for a second when your sword is 
red, it seems they are genially afraid of getting hit by their own move more so than Yoshi's 
moves for some reason –this does not apply so much for Jin though-. I usually save my stolen 
move until the next round. Try this match opener: d/b+1,WS+1(+2),1+4 (Jin's 1,2,3),f+3,3 
The ballerina kicks are a juggle of the launch if you manage to connect all the three hits of the 
stolen move, it makes out 72 points in damage so at least try it once okay.

If you find yourself blocking the laser scraper you must wait until he has finished his second 
punch and then sidestep to your right (Jin's left) to get out of harms way. Always do this 
when facing the scraper. Even if he does the normal without the uppercut at the end or 
quickest JF (small blue lights on his right hand) you should be able to SS it easily as long as 
you blocked the earlier hits. Don't forget to either launch (d/f+2) or throw him after the SS. 
Oh and against Jin the flash can be used with success as an match opener to push him back 
and make him doubt his style –I often steal his d,d/f,f+2 when doing this and that specific 
punch is great for either juggle enders when close or inside your customs so use it if you got it 
okay-.

*Note: If you ever see Jin charging up and starts to glow red, punish him for even thinking 
that he could pull that flashy shit on you. Remember that he can't block when glowing so any 
move that stops him and removes the glow is a good move (quick pokes and so on). If you 
block while he is glowing you will take some guard damage and you will usually loose the 
momentum, advanced players sometimes does his punch or kick reversal out of the glow to 
get people like me who goes in for a jab/kick and catch us with a reversal -but it rarely 
happens though*

      B+2,3,(4)
      d/b+4 (Yoshi does not suffer from guard stagger)

Yoshimitsu VS Law

Against Law Yoshi usually can play as he was ment to. Confusing and CH baiting. Law is 
quick, but he still is a good thinker and a considering player nonetheless. He will usually not 
attack you blindly because many of his high priority moves have long wind up time and are 
easily punished on block. On the other hand you cannot attack blindly yourself, just because 
he doesn't attack you don't mean that you should attack him. Law is in T4 not as offensive as 
he used too be, but he has become a great CH baiter. Watch out for those DSS cancels. Still, 
they can come out of so many different moves that you must take the risk from time to time. 
Mostly common DSS cancel are as follows: 1,2~b,f   the: b+2,3,4~b,f   the: WS+3~b,f   the: 
4,3,4~b,f   and the b+1(,2,1)~b,f.

If he starts pressuring you with 1,2,3,1,2,3 and some set-ups after this, a SS or the flash is the 
easiest and safest way out, plus you even might steal the 1,2,3 string he has. Oh if you ever 
steal Law's d/b+4 sweep use it. This move gives you great okizeme options on hit and you 
will not get that damn guard stagger on block either so it's pretty safe. Law also has punch 
parries and a kick reversal if he is real fast (b~F+1 after he's normal b+2+4 parry) so don't get 
predictable, at least not with your punches. The poison breath works well against Law.

Yoshimitsu VS Bryan

Don't just attack blindly when facing Bryan. He has a mean parry reversal, ducking and 
avoiding moves that punish nearly all high attacks, very high priority launchers from crouch 
and swaying and a real ugly sweep with simply great juggle follow-ups from that specific 
move. Don't get caught up against walls fighting him, he is very though to beat when you 
can't backdash or sidestep. Bryan is like an old locomotive, it takes some time to start it up, 
but once you get it going it's damn hard too stop it. I don't know of any other character in T4 
who manages to get so many perfects as Bryan does (not wins though). But Bryan is mainly 
made to stop bullies like Jin and Paul, not punishing thinking players as Yoshi, so if he tries 
too use his normal high priority moves and set-ups many will whiff (due to your SS, stance 
switching, ha-ha step and so on) so be sure to punish him when this happens. 

The upside when fighting Bryan is that when you start to control the pace of the match Yoshi 
normally wins. Ducking and duckjabbing and the SS+1 (sidestep to you left if far away and 
right if up close) is highly recommended against Bryan; you need to stop him before he starts 
so to speak. The flash is not that useful against him (mostly semi good juggle enders anyway, 
the d/f+1,1,1,1,1,2 is a good "normal" move too steal and can be useful against walls and 
inside your own mix-ups and strings). If you block his d/f+3 be sure to juggle him with your 
u/f+3 afterwards. The same d/f+3 also makes it VERY unsafe for you to go in IND when semi 
close or close to him cause he don't need too think twice about what hit's low, he knows that 
his high priority d/f+3 kills on the ground. Try using you small poking and kicking custom 
strings and always worry about those parries he got. If you expect a parry or maybe just did 
the same custom a moment ago switch for instance the WS+1+2 into a WS+4 to catch him 
while he is parrying. 
 
Against Bryan the poison breath is very good, try starting a match with it or just ducking the 
last or first high kicks in a string with it. Your 1,2,1 jabs are useless on block where he always 
will parry your last 1 punch. The SS+1 to poison breath can work wonders if he's feeling 
aggressive. If you find yourself at a distance Bryan usually has the upper hand with the mach 
punch and kick (you still have fubuki –the fastest knee in the game- though), the f,f+3 which 
can be stalled for confusion and of course he's taunt which he sometimes uses to load himself 
up for a mean 7 hit combo, he can wait to execute this combo for about five seconds after the 
taunt so watch out, and on top of this it is unblockable if it connects and takes away 60 
damage points; he also sometimes uses the taunt to make you miscalculate your incoming 
attack and CH you instead. If you decide to sidestep against Bryan when at a distance NEVER 
SS to your right (Bryans left), the moves he has that get sidesteppers are usually on that side 
so sidestep to your left instead. Unfortunately the d/f+1,2,D/B+2,2 to any WS or FC move- 
string you have is almost useless as he can (and usually will) punch parry your manji spin 
slap. Concentrate on quick kicks some poking and your unblockables.

Yoshimitsu VS Paul

Paul has many high priority and easy too execute moves, this makes him one of the toughest 
fights in the game. His d+4,2,1+2 JF for instance can be abused bigtime and murder anyone in 
seconds. He also has a ok okizeme and distance game, but Paul likes to be up close where he 
can jab, and jab, maybe grab you and then jab some more. You cannot match Paul in a 
jabbing contest, he has vicious set-ups from the jabs and duckers and duck-jabbers usually 
don't cause him big troubles. What does cause Paul some troubles though is sidestepping. 
Many of his up close and distance moves will not catch SS, but don't SS when your just 
inside of jabbing reach, this is usually the distance where that damn d+4,2,1+2 comes out so 
be careful. Your u/f+4 (avoiding the puddle) works well sometimes if you time it so Paul 
misses the initial d+4 low kick and is in general a good move against Paul right along with 
your universal life saver the SS+1. Try this against Paul to avoid his d+4,2: 
f+2~d/b+2,2,u/f+4

The flash don't have that many uses against Paul, but still the SS+3, the b,f+1, d,d/f,f+1, 
d,d/f,f+2 and the f+1+4 are moves that is fairly easy too steal and is useful inside your own 
mix-ups or juggles. You can also steal the d+1,4,2, but this many times relies on Paul 
whiffing this move so don't count on it. If Paul does his easy just frame move -the 
d+1,4,2,1+2- you can launch him with your d/f+2 uppercut in between the last 2 and 1+2 due 
to a funny bug. Also Paul himself is like a giant bug, many, many juggles simply won't 
connect on him so go for your safest and easiest juggles. This also applies for many other 
characters when trying their CH juggles on Paul. Hwoarangs CH juggles for instance will 
always whiff on him for some reason (well I guess the reason for those bugs that works in 
Paul's favour is that Paul is one of the creators of Tekken favourite character, or so I've been 
told. I guess he lost some matches with him and decided to make him even better).

In closing you should SS at a distance and when very close to him, use the u/f+4 from time to 
time, launch him with your uppercut (d/f+2) every time you block his d+1+2 shoulder and in 
between the easy JF move, and steal his deathfist whenever you get the chance. Watch out for 
his swaying, try a U/F+4 when you see him swaying. The poison breath can be good against 
him and your Indian sit arts are not so useful against him. Paul's most used special throw is 
the d/f+1+2, this has a 1+2 escape button so hopefully you manage too escape it now that you 
know what it is. If you ever find yourself blocking a deathfist AND you have stolen a 
deathfist from him from earlier you can with success press 1+4 after block and laugh in his 
face as he get struck with his own deathfist, this is unblockable if done quick enough (thanks 
to Tenshi's Yoshi faq).

Yoshimitsu VS Steve

When I play against Steve I play a strictly turtling game and rely very much on the flash. My 
brother plays Steve a lot and when he starts with his evil mix-ups it's extremely hard to get out 
of them (guard stagger, turns you to the side on block, stuns and so on). It is also very hard to 
bulldogg Steve so I normally don't bother even trying. Steve also has some low start mix-ups 
that start with d+2,1, and he has the cheesy 1,2,1,d+2 which hits low on the last hit. I find it 
easy to block both of these lows on reaction and therefore I usually just active block when 
he's throwing punches at me. If you block the 1,2,1,d+2 you should launch him with u/f+3. 
Ducking, sidestepping and even duckjabbing can be extremely dangerous against Steve. 

I flash him almost as much as possible and every time i expect the d/f+1+2 which is 
extremely fast and damaging, I then throw some punches/kicks (d/f+4) to buy some time 
before unleashing the stolen move (the d/f+1+2) back at him. I never play a distance game 
with Steve (except when I feel like using Fubuki that is), which I find to be very dangerous 
when being Yoshi. 

If I am at a distance I simply let him get up in my face to throw punches at me. Be patient and 
simply block them all until you get an opening for the flash or a quick custom string. Play 
boring and cheap. Let him use so many moves that he just don't know what more to do and 
then retaliate or flash him. If he gets in his flicker stance I never attack or duck or duckjab. 
Simply block and wait him out until he's finished, or flash and steal the flicker stance, or do 
nothing at all and wait until he gets out of flicker by himself. Attacking Steve when he's in 
flicker is asking for trouble. Going low can be successful at times since many Steve's have a 
hard time blocking low. Every time I see Steve ducking (not much) or swaying (more often) I 
do the Fubuki or the samurai knee to punish him.

My three main rules VS steve:
1: Active guard
2: Flash him
3: Don't duck"

Yoshimitsu VS Lei

I love this guy. He has very sophisticated set-ups and can go through a whole match just 
switching in and out of different stances and never doing the same move more than once. He 
is -like Yoshi- one of the most confusing characters in the game. He is one of my favourite 
characters and is very versatile in his gameplay. Every one who plays Lei has made up his 
own style unlike the Paul's and Mishimas where people tend to use the same patterns as 
others.

However, even if Lei is a kung fu master who can dance around you all day he has many 
weaknesses also, mainly speed. You are the quicker one and you should be the one placing 
the pressure, not him. Lei simply has to many great set-ups against turtlers so you can and 
should play as a bully. One of his other weaknesses is that he very often tends to lie down on 
the ground thus making opponents whiff moves and/or stop to think what will hit him lying 
down there. Well you being Yoshi will of course hope that he lies down in front of you. When 
he does (and he will) do either one of the poison wind combos or mix-ups on him, slice him 
with the d+1, the d+1+2 or the U/F+1+2. If you decide to do the deathcopter I suggest you 
either press D very quickly or press B so you turn 180 degrees in the air and hopefully hit him 
in the back.

Your Med stance is useful, along with the flea stance. Indian sit arts is more or less unsafe 
cause he has many high priority mids and lows that will get you and poison breath is not safe 
at all against Lei. Lei will also usually go for a low mid guessing game. If you ever block his 
d/b+4 be sure too launch him with u/f+3 afterwards.

The flash is sometimes useful against him sometimes not so useful. The easiest moves too 
steal are his razor rush, the 4~4,3,3 and the d/b+4 which he uses quite often. You can also 
stop the razor rush when he's stance switching out of it by pressing d/b+1.

      f,f,N,3+4

Yoshimitsu VS Lee

Lee is one of those characters that people tend too either diss or too praise. You either love 
him or hate him. I find it somewhat strange that Namco felt they had to have a posh guy in a 
dinner outfit with stripes or those tight black leather pants with a sky blue top in a hardcore 
testosterone filled fighting game, but I still genially like his style. He is in my book a great 
character that also is amusing to play with even if he doesn't have that many moves.

Lee has mist step set-ups. Usually you can duckjab to escape them once he starts stepping 
forward (1,2 mist step 1,2 miststep or a mid kick that can leave him in hitman). He also has 
great juggles (maybe the best and easiest infinities in the game) and a fairly fast jab and good 
duckjabbing mix-ups. He will sometimes enter the hitman stance and usually go for a special 
hitman throw, a low sweep that's very easy too spot and a somewhat tougher to spot launcher 
that hits mid, or he can just sidestep when in this stance. He can also block anything when in 
this stance. You on the other hand can either do your poison breath on him, flash and steal the 
stance AND the moves out of this stance which is a great addition that you seldom find when 
stealing stances, or you can try to hop over him or simply just go low with d+3 to annoy him 
and kick him in the shin.

Lee also relies very much on a psycho quick launching right knee similar to your own u/f+3. 
From this launcher he can juggle you too death if he gets you near a wall, so avoid ducking 
too much when close and instead go for a sidestep. Don't worry about damaging lows since 
he just don't have such moves. What he has instead is annoying low kicks that either is three 
lows and one mid (d+4,4,4,4) or one low and then two highs and one mid (d+4,N,4,3,3). If 
you block the initial low kick it is easy to duckjab (or block on hit) your way out of the 
l,h,h,m kicks and it's very easy to block the l,l,l,m kicks if that's what comes out instead. He 
also has a quick sweep that don't knock down on CH, but turns you too the side for more 
options if your not a good blocker.

Lee is another one of those characters that the flash isn't that useful against. However your 
poison breath is good against him and your Med stance and Indian sit arts are not that bad 
either. You should avoid using flea too much since Lee has a great juggle opportunity by 
simply pressing 1,2 and going in his mist step madness juggles. The easiest move too steal 
from Lee is the machine gun kicks (4,4,4 or d+4,4,4,4) and the b+4.

Custom strings and mix-ups with Lee's stolen moves:

Kuma/Panda

      3+4 Hunting bear stance (Yoshi will go in the stance and blow poison breath with 1 or 2 
or he will do the bear tackle by pressing 3 or 4

Yoshimitsu VS Kuma/Panda

Ah the bear. I am sure that in their spare time between fights Yoshi and the bear are out 
fishing together, or just walking and/or training in the woods together. Anyway the bear is a 
formidable opponent. He is very powerful, has great okizeme and is not that slow for a huge 
bear.

Kuma will try too keep you at some distance for him too be efficient and for his jabs to out 
priority your kicks. He will not sidestep too much and go in his hunting stance as often as 
possible. He will duck high kicks and start a low-mid jabbing string while ducking or rise 
with WS+1+2 or WS+1,2.

Since you have the greater speed you should try to bully the teddybear from the get-go. Use 
all your set-ups and quick recovery moves so that you never allow him to hit you with a 
power move. If you fall too the ground or get launched with the f,f+2 you will take massive 
damage and must struggle to gain advantage once more.

If you see Kuma going in hunting bear stance you probably should try to hop over him, do a 
moonsault slayer (only if at a distance) or go in flea if he is close to the wall. When in flea 
press U/F and hop towards him sword first, if the sword connects press f,f (or just 1+2) as 
soon as possible to do the running flea as a small wall juggle and to get some more damage in 
on him.

Against Kuma the flash is only as important as you make it. Against him you don't really 
NEED to steal moves, but the moves you CAN steal from kuma are quite good moves (except 
for lessened range that is). If you ever see his unblockable turning into a rolling bear you 
should still flash and steal this specific move. Use it as a wake-up game after a knockdown 
later in the game. Against Kuma all of your stances are great and should be used from time to 
time, and as far as unblockables go the poison breath is usually the best alternative against 
him when he's on his feet and the spinning sword or flea when he's grounded.

      d+3+4,2

      F+1+2
      f,f+4 (If this hits on CH Yoshi will do the convict kick-throw)

Yoshimitsu VS King

Against King Yoshi is usually the stronger one. He has loads of simple moves that many, 
many Kings just don't know how to cope with. Try playing as a bully and use a lot of quick 
punches. Do I even need to say that you should watch out for grab combos! If King ever starts 
up that 1,2,1 jabbing game of his there are two things to worry about, jab and grab and the 10 
hit combos. All jab and grab combos can be escaped with pressing 2 and all the 10 hit combos 
can be escaped by waiting for the first low and the parry it. Do this every time and your doing 
fine.

If you are at a distance the black shoulder rush is what's most likely to come out. You should 
flash this. It is extremely hard to SS it and almost any attempt made by you trying to catch 
him on the CH will not work, this move is very useful once stolen so use it in the same 
situation or as a wake-up game. Don't SS at a distance, don't duck too much, don't rely on too 
much kicking and use your f,f+4 knee and you should be doing fine. 

The poison breath is OK against King, the Flea stance is also just OK, your Med stance is 
usually unsafe against him and Indian sit arts is great facing King. The flash is not that useful 
against King except at a distance or if you are panicking when you see a grab combo coming 
your way somewhat late in the animation, and finally your 1,2,1 jabs are simply great against 
him cause he has a hard time ducking them and go for a grab combo as he usually does 
against 1,2 punches.

      d/f+4,4
      u/f+4,(4),(4),(4) (Yoshi will do the whole string)

Yoshimitsu VS Kazuya

Mister stun himself. Watch out for moves that stun, if Kazuya connects a stun prepare too see 
as much as 80 points of your lifebar disappear in about two seconds. Kazuya has power, but 
that is about it. He doesn't have avoiding and/or ducking moves, he doesn't have any defence 
moves, he doesn't have SS moves and he is way slower than you. Play as you usually do, you 
are faster then him so exploit that fact by constantly throwing jabs at his face and go for your 
custom strings and mix-ups.

Kazuya must bully to be efficient. Watch out for hell sweeps, SS that cancels into a regular 4 
kick, 1,1,2's, left and right heavy uppercuts, 1,2 to 1,2,4 and 1,2 to d/f+1,f+2 mix-ups and of 
course wall pushes. If Kazuya get in a wall push on you prepare to loose about 55 points in 
damage, so be careful when you are close to walls. Don't duck too much when playing 
against Kazuya, if you expect a hellsweep try too flash instead.

Against Kazuya the Med stance is unsafe. Flea is also unsafe. You should avoid sidestepping 
and moves that he can easily duck under. Your poison breath is quite good against him and 
Indian sit arts can also be helpful, but is not to be considered your greatest weapon. Your 
u/f+2 uppercut is usually great against him. Kazuya doesn't have many moves, which means 
that your flash is extremely efficient against him and only steal very useful moves. You can 
steal all his uppercuts, his hellsweeps, his WS+2 stunner and his 1,2,4 string so there you go, 
this your number one flash man, so flash him OK.

      RFF 4,3

      RFF 2,b+4 (Yoshi will do RFF b+4)

Yoshimitsu VS Hwoarang

Well you don't want too get caught up in his infinitive flamingo combo that's for sure, but if 
you play someone good you will be very soon since you don't have any kick reversals. He 
never thinks, just attacks with high priority kicks. If he starts up with the infinitive flamingo 
combo try to duckjab during the high 4 kick of his d+3,4 or after his flamingo right punch 
d+3,4,2 or simply flash him to stop him cold in the spot. Don't let him get started, stop him as 
soon as possible! Watch out for 2,3,d,3,4 strings and 2,3,3,3,4 strings. If you are on the 
ground let him hit you once and stand up, if you techroll or backroll (or anything else than just 
lie still) you will be caught up in a techroll trap and another okizeme.

Your jabs are quicker than his so use them ok. Try to keep him inside jabbing range for you to 
be efficient and for your jabs to out prioritise his kicks.

Your Poison breath is very good against him. The flea stance is not that good along with Med. 
Indian sit arts can be useful at times, but be careful as he just might d+3,4,N,3 on you while 
your sitting down, thus creating a small juggle on you. Jabbing is highly recommended and 
SS if he don't have you in a string of some kind. SS at a distance and not so much when up-
close. Unfortunately the flash is almost useless against him except for stopping his offence. 
You can however steal the f,Nd,d/f+4 launcher which is by far the easiest and best move you 
can steal from him.

      b,b,N,3+4 ) (Yoshi will do the poison breath and then run away)

Yoshimitsu  VS Heiachi

Well Heiachi used to be the button mashers number 1 choice, and he still is even if he is toned 
down a bit. He has many high priority kicks and punches with great damage. Watch out for 
SS cancels into a 4 kick, it will stun on CH and give him a free stun juggle. Like his son he is 
very dangerous against walls and if he connects a walls push on you he can sometimes do a 
68 points unescapable wall combo on you. DO NOT SS against Heiachi, he has so many 
moves that catch SS and duckers with such high priority that is asking for trouble. Usually he 
will want to end the match quick with power moves and some poking tools as well.

You are quicker than him so place your pressure in fast jabs and custom strings. Try to avoid 
ducking against him except when near walls (I still recommend the flash near walls). The 
d/f+2 is useful against him and so is Flea and Med stances to. The poison breath and the 
Indian sit arts is not that useful. The flash can be helpful against him, but not so much as with 
Kazuya. You usually end up stealing the d/f+1,2 and the f,N,d,d/f+2 uppercut, none of these 
are bad moves so use them if you got them ok.

      FC,d/f+4

Yoshimitsu  VS Marduk

Tekken is very well balanced. Each player has power instead of speed and similar things that 
evens him or her out with the other players. So why did Namco decide to put in a brute bigger 
than the bear(!) who has great small jabs and set-ups from these, the best ever distance game, 
great punishing moves, reversals and extreme power! If there is one character that is 
overpowered in T4 it is this guy, in my opinion he shouldn't be so strong and he should be 
waay slower. The only safe way to kill this guy is too start using Paul, Hwoarang, Ling or Jin.

You are faster than him so use that to your advantage. If you don't bully him too death soon 
you'll most likely have some troubles beating a good Marduk. I love to play him and hate to 
play VS him so too speak. Don't even think about baiting, if Marduk ever see you 
intentionally whiff a move you will be tackled so just forget your distance game all together, 
go close. The worst Maduk to play is the repeated thinking tackler. He will tackle you on 
every chance he gets, but he wont use the same set-up for it twice. Every time he is at a 
distance he'll run in to tackle you, after every knockdown roll away, after every juggle and 
every time he sees you turtle, aouch, that's gotta hurt.

So why is Yoshi so hard to play against a good Marduk, well his damn b+4 will hit you out of 
anything so too speak. In this custom string for instance: d/f+1,2,d/b+2,2,u/f+3 you will be hit 
by this kick between the last 2 and the rising knee (u/f+3) for some reason so use a WS+1+2 
or a crouching punch followed by WS+1+2 at the end instead to be safer. Also when using 
stances it means that your using time, this time should have been used to bully him, not too 
set-up strings and other fancy shit. If you are in flea he'll kick you out of it with the b+4. The 
same goes for meditation stance and unfortunately your poison breath as well. If he sees you 
in Indian sit arts he'll try his b+1 okizeme tool to inflict major damage.

The Flea is almost useless against Marduk. Med is also useless. The poison breath can be 
good at times but is not all that safe. Indian sit arts can also work, but is not to be considered 
safe either. The flash can be useful to stop his tackle (that's about all it's uses when it comes 
too this guy due too the range of his other moves), but I actually recommend you hop over 
him instead and get behind him or kick him with 3 from the hop. If you steal the tackle you 
must use it as SOON as possible to gain psychological advantage over him, even if the 
damage is not that great when you do it. The fubuki (f,f+4) is one of your best friends when 
fighting Marduk. Remember that you can't low parry his d+4 low kick so block it instead and 
watch out for his special juggling throw – the release is 1+2 (same as the tackle). After you 
have been knocked down you should roll to the side and then back to be safe from his power 
okizeme tools, beware of tackles once you rise up, try a normal hop over if he comes at you.

Yoshimitsu VS Christie

Well Christie is a dancer, however confusing you find her to be she is still nothing more than 
a dancer, this simply means that she dances a lot between moves and is extremely vulnerable 
in that exact stage of her animation. Still she is a strong character and can easily snuff you out 
very quick if you let her. She is like Hwoarang in a way, she uses mostly high priority kicking 
strings and mix-ups with the occasional punch and punch to kick combos to win her frames or 
set her up for a kicking combo from another stance, also she resembles Lei in the fact that she 
has a mid low guess-up game, but hers is definitely better, that is if you don't look at the time 
she uses when switching in and out of stances and between moves. Christie is actually a slow 
character even if she has an 8 frames fast jab, use that fact.

Try to block her lows in her strings and retaliate immediately afterwards with for instance a 
WS+4 or d/b+1 before she is set up for a mid kick. She stays on the ground a lot so don't 
commit your self to high attacks unless she is standing and even then many will whiff cause 
Christie loves to dodge high attack by going in her stances. She relies somewhat on you 
thinking "What too do, what too do?" when she is dancing so the worst you can do is to be 
confused and try to block your way out of it. Remember, if she dances a lot she is open for 
retaliation a lot. Try to keep your distance, either be very close or far away from her.

Your poison breath is almost completely useless against Christie, the flash is only helpful to 
stop her in her tracks, she doesn't have that many useful moves to steal (except the 3~4 that 
is), but the flash can save your life against Christie. If you can't think of something that will 
hit her down there fast enough simply flash her to gain the momentum of the fight. Flea 
stance can be very useful as she's on the ground. Simply mount your sword, load it and let 
Christie dance her way into pain, follow up with the flea headbutt and a wake-up game. Your 
d+1+2 can also be used with some success and many times this launches her so high you can 
do a juggle of your choice afterwards. Also a simple d+1 and the deathcopter can murder any 
Christie. In closing Use flea a lot, Poison wind combos are great, sword slices, door knocker 
and the samurai knee are also useful moves against her.

Yoshimitsu VS Julia

Julia Chang. She is the other competitor in the King of Iron Fist Tournament that has joined 
for unselfish reasons. She is fast as hell and has plenty of quick mids and lows. She can be 
real dangerous in the right hands. Julia's main offence is in her elbows, beware of that f+1 
which can stop you in many of your more sophisticated set-ups like the d/b+2,2,2 mix-ups 
you have. She is also a very powerful character at a distance so try to go close as much as you 
can.

Her lows are pretty much kind of slow and easy to spot and parry or to block, so do that. Do 
not duck too much against her and almost never if she's crouching. Watch out for the special 
throw with a 1+2 release button and the SS+2 she has. Julia is fast but she is no bully like 
Paul and Jin. She will want to control the pace of the match so stress her as much as possible 
to get the upper hand, watch out for that 1,1,1 though –it hits hard.

The flash can be extremely useful against Julia, she has tons of useful moves too steal, and 
even a throw. The sword spin will grant you success from time to time when at some distance 
and the poison breath is an OK move. Low sword sweep can be efficient right along with the 
lunging sweep kick and SS+1. Flea will most likely grant you success if used right (punish 
many of her elbows and low kicks with this). Indian sit arts are quite unsafe, but your med 
stance is somewhat safer (make her whiff a move and then punish).

Ling
      1,(2),(1) (Yoshi will do 1,2,1)
      d/f+1 (Yoshi will go in BT after this)

              breath by pressing 1 or 2)
      u+1+2,(2),(1) (Yoshi will do u+1+2,2,1)
      f,f+1+2,(1+2) or f,f+2,1(Yoshi will do f,f+1+2,1+2)

      AOP 2,(1)
      f+3

Yoshimitsu VS Ling

This fine little Japanese schoolgirl can be very hard indeed. She, like you, relies on mainly 
confusing mix-ups and strings and simply loves that small poking terror of hers. She is faster 
than you in almost any situation and she is many peoples favourite character. She stands high 
in tournaments and usually possesses one of the top three places at the end of it. I love this 
girl. I love to play her and I love to play against her and see she how fluidly she moves around 
the floor trying to set you up for a juggle or okizeme. She is a poking character and will stay 
in your face where she is most efficient.

Watch out for that low punch when she's back turned and that WS+4 kick she has. If she 
connects this kick on you she has a real mean okizeme and wake up game from that specific 
move. Don't worry too much about throws, they usually just have a 2 punch release button. If 
she ever does that no damage guard stunning low "kick" (d/b+3) on you, you should either 
block afterwards or flash her, if you flash you usually steal a move cause this is a set-up she 
has to connect high damage moves.

Don't let her be in your face. If she starts those low mid guess-ups she has you have serious 
problems. Try too keep your distance and use fubuki (f,f+4) a lot. Your samurai knee (u/f+3) 
and the SS+1 can be very useful too. SS a lot when playing VS Ling. The poison breath is not 
that good against her, but your Flea stance is actually, try hopping at her when in flea, and 
avoid her hitting you by pressing 3 or 4 repeated times. The lunging sweep kick can work 
well at some distance and sometimes a quick deathcopter (u/f+1+2~D) also does the trick. 
The flash can be used as a safe way to stop her when she is dangerously close, but there is not 
too many useful moves too steal from her unfortunately, well except for f,f+3+4 d/f+1 to BT 
d/b+3 and d+1 to AOP that is, still not too much though.

Custom strings and mix-ups with Ling's stolen moves:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nina
      d/f+1,2,1,(2) or 1,2,1,(2) (Yoshi will do 2,1,2,f+1+2)
      1,2,1,2,f+1+2 (Yoshi will do f+1+2
      SS~1,f+3 (Yoshi will do f,f+3)
      SS~1,f+4 (Yoshi will do f,f+4)
      d/f+1+2
      b+2,(2)
      f,f+3
      d/b+3+4
      d/b+4,(3) (Yoshi will do d/b+4,3)
      d,d/f+4

The German lady can be hard for anyone to beat. She has multithrows, good poking abilities, 
long range high priority kicks, very good set-ups, a sweep with nice okizeme and wake-up 
game follow-ups, kick and punch reversals and of course speed.

Nina will want to control the match. She is good up close and at medium distances and this is 
where she will be most of the time, in your face or just outside of kicking range. Watch out 
for her 1+4 punch kick combo, if she connects this she will either do another one, some kick 
series or most common a special throw with a 1+2 release button. It plain sucks to be hit by 
the 1+4 she has cause she has such a strong frame advantage once that happens and so many 
follow-ups you just never can be sure what will come out. Flashing can work against this 
sometimes if timed correctly, but still it's only recommended on block where you push her 
away and your safe again. If it hits I usually hold B and try to see if it's a throw that comes 
out (1+2 release button most common). Also be careful when she is crouchdashing, she can 
cancel it into a low kick, do a mid kick if she please or just go for a multithrow combo. If she 
tries that multithrow the release button is the 1 punch button I believe.

Your poison breath is quite good against her, Med stance can also grant you success if you 
manage to make her whiff something. Your Flea stance is not that great against her, but try to 
go in flea and right in Indian sit arts making her whiff a high move. Indian sit arts alone is 
also useful at times, but not your best offence. SS a lot when playing VS Nina, use your SS+1 
up close and Fubuki when at some distance. Jabbing is recommended against her, and you 
will often connect the low sword sweep too so use it. The flash can be used to stop her, but 
she don't have that many useful moves to steal so don't concentrate on just stopping her with 
the flash, a simple SS works well many times and sometimes set you up for a d/f+2 and a 
juggle for instance.

Custom strings and mix-ups with Nina's stolen moves:



* Note: There are some other special properties about the soul stealer. For instance you can 
steal the crouchdash (f,N,d,d/f) moves from Nina and King, but when you use it Yoshi just 
does the crouchdash move, then sits down in the indian sit arts and from there you can puff 
out small poison breaths by pressing 1 or 2 (maybe it's 1+2).*
