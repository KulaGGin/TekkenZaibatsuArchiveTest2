[3XL] "A good Hwoarang is a stylish Hwoarang."

This was definitely true in previous Tekkens; those who played Hwoarang already
knew he had quick, flashy, and powerful moves, but above all, he had the most 
movement options available outside of Xiaoyu.  But it was always an uphill 
battle.  There were no safe, damaging, abusable launchers Hwoarang had.  Many
power moves hit high or had bad recovery.  Given the amount of stuns induced 
from counterhits, one might say he needed them as much as Bruce did, only the 
pay-offs weren't quite that big.  Hwoarang players had to take advantage of 
every opportunity, often baiting and creating their own.  Thus mind reading 
played a more crucial role than that of the Mishima players.

All this changed in Tekken 4.  In the early days of playing, one might have
noticed how the "accepted" style of Hwoarang changed from "movement, counter-
hits and planning" to "juggles, bulldogging, and guessing."  Properties for 
many moves that gave guaranteed damage (namely 4, RFF 4~f CH, b+4, d+3,4,b+3) 
were either watered down or eliminated completely.  Triple sidesteps weren't
nearly as effective.  Even the command low parry was gone!

Fast forward a few months and it becomes apparent that the boring DoA-style
string-based gameplay becomes the new, wildly popular, and (unfortunately)
only style of gameplay.  Creativity with Hwoarang is effectively shunned upon 
as the only moves one really needs to remember are the Flamingo mix-ups, b+3,
and d/b+4,4, with other moves and juggle starters thrown in "for variety."
It is here that the two "factions" of Hwoarang players were established: one
was for dumbed-downed bulldogging like the more popular Baek style (apropos,
I play Baek in TTT as well and I don't play like this), and the other was
for the old school, thinking man's Hwoarang.  There were vids here and there
only showing the visually boring Hwoarang, but the Japanese "nachi" vids were
the nail in the coffin for movement-based Hwoarangs, now the dissenters.

This FAQ aims to correct this by putting Hwoarang in a new light.  Usage of 
moves and movement will be shown in several ways, as well as including a very
general style of gameplay for beginners, culminating in a style that is known 
as "Liquid."


[D14] Hwoarang is one of the few characters that give you multiple ways of 
using him. He has pokes, strings, juggles, advanced movements , cancels, a 
shitty JF( well at least compared to other JF’s), good okizeme, excellent 
throw game. I believe that the key to using everything effectively, is to use 
it in balance. 

When I see people just using pokes/strings they tend to do the same things 
over and over, which is fine, but your Hwoarang will be stuck on the same 
level after a while.

When I use too much movement and try to use a Fox Step at predictable moments, 
I begin to get punished.

Different juggles have their own time and place in his game, but if you try 
to juggle all the time you become predictable.

Throws can somewhat be overused, but getting predictable with them wont help 
you out.

When everything is used in conjunction, different things start to have their 
time and place and Hwoarang not only becomes a stronger character, but a fun 
character to play as.


[3XL]

* The term "Liquid" comes from WCMaxi (then "Jarney").  The general idea is
  to attack instead of block, and when you can't, dodge instead of block.  In
  fact, here's an email from about 3 years ago (1999), back when I was still 
  learning Tekken 3 stuff beyond the Versus Books guide:

   "Well my fighting style has changed dramatically since the book, to say 
    the least. Everyone fights annoyance/poking style now. So I created the 
    counter style known as "Liquid". And Ling, King, Hwoa, and Nina a 
    slick as oil when it come to the flow. I'll explain "Liquid" sometime 
    but to be brief it is a style based on constant offensive motions... 
    even the defense is offense based. Every motion is with a purpose and 
    the purpose is to break down your defense. Poking is like that but 
    they do it though attacking... since I am in motion I can not be 
    poked. The first time you fight it you will be a bit shocked... it is 
    weird but when I played Ling I DO NOT block, EVER. I don't need to, if 
    I can't beat it I will dodge it."

  Since the release of Soul Calibur, however, WCMaxi has turned into such an
  unbelievable bastard.  Just ask anyone except tragic, Castel, Srayer, and
  RedfooT!  And if WCMaxi or one of his SC cohorts is reading this, then I'm 
  sorry, but you shouldn't have turned into such an unbelievable bastard.  I
  say this with the utmost respect of course; one does not become a Tekken
  Zaibatsu administrator without holding at least a little bit of clout in
  the community.  And of course he makes great Skill Project videos.

Throughout this FAQ you will see comments from both myself and deftones14.
This approach has been proven with Dayful's & ILuvMomo's TTT Julia FAQ.  A
character like Hwoarang allows for myriad fighting styles, so different
commentaries can only help.

* If, by the end of the FAQ, the style doesn't turn out to be truly Liquid
(according to Nuts' standards), then... bleh.  I was just trying to make the
most complete Hwoarang FAQ, along the lines of Red King's quality work.

==============================================================================

This movelist is taken from Tekken Zaibatsu, but the formatting is exclusive
to this FAQ.  For example, the Damage column has been removed in all sections
to faciliate formatting and printing.  All move stats (damage, frame data, etc)
are included in the Move Analysis page.  (Hint: use the "Find" function, done
with Ctrl+F)  Don't steal this, lest you be flamed to hell and back by the 
growing number of Hwoarang players.  You can ask, though. 


The Stance Column indicates which Stance Hwoarang is in after a move. No entry 
in the Stance Column equals LFF, Hwoarang's default Stance. Double check the 
Legend for Stance abbreviations.

[3XL] Hwoarang has a great throw game.  I personally like using them when I
can; they're damaging and easy to mix-up, especially considering the variety 
of movements Hwoarang already has.  The fact that they're the best looking 
in the game is just an added bonus!


[D14] I have to agree completely.  Besides having fancy throws Hwoarang has 
great Okizeme opportunities after some of them. His throws also have a great 
reach and different escape buttons to make the guessing game even greater.  
I consider his throws to be his best low attacks and sometimes even 
interruptors. Ducking an attack and then retaliating with a throw gives you 
the breathing space and time that you may need at the moment.

LFF 2+4               front     Falcon Dive Kick                2

  Damage: 20,10
  F Hit: 12
  Advantage After Escape: 0 

Your opponent ends in FCD.


[3XL] This throw is very nice in that you have a high chance of tacking on
more damage - you can do b+3 if they lie still.  However the "stun" you
give when this move hits is NOT the same as it was in TTT, where you had
(I think) a free U,(land)+3.  That kick isn't in Tekken 4 anyway.

An old TTT trick was to SS (I forget which way) and you can do the d/b+3+4 
unblockable.  It was supposed to be inescapable, but it was escapable by 
simply rolling (passing through the leg); I never bothered with this.  

One more use for this throw is by doing it BT.  The same 2+4 throw comes out
if you're BT LFF or BT RFF.  This trick may have been around since Tekken 3, 
but I think the potential was fully realized in Tekken 4 (or Tag), with Fox 
Steps (explained later) and BT launcher mix-ups.  Credit for that, though
indirectly, goes to deftones14.


[D14] Even though getting out of this throw is easier than others it is still 
one of his best.  db+4/b+3/another throw are Okizeme follow-ups.  In order to 
get out of db+4 follow-up they have to roll to the side right away, however it 
takes practice to do so and would rarely happen in a heated battle.  B+3 is a 
tad slower than db+4(escaping this is easier also), however if they screw up 
and roll forward or backward they should be kissing the sky at this point. A 
throw is for those who stand up and like to block your oki moves.  B+3/a throw 
is a very good combination in this situation.  Your opponent can't interrupt 
db+4/ B+3 after this throw!

  F Hit: 12
  Advantage After Escape: 0 

Your opponent ends in FCD.


[3XL] Well, it's a throw, with the same damage as the other one.  Doing
d/b+4,4 -immediately- may yield some success, as it did on a "Guard All"
opponent.  Walls can only help!


[D14] I am no frame expert, but it seems that this throw has less of an escape 
window than 2+4.  No Oki follow-ups unless the opponent is next to a wall.
You can execute this throw by pressing 2+4~f.

RFF (1+3_2+4)         front     Anti Sub Rocket      RFF        17 

  Damage: 40
  F Hit: 17
  Advantage After Escape: 0 

Your opponent ends in PLD.


[3XL] Also known as the "Ass Lock" (or "Ass Rock," depending on the trans-
lation), this is a good throw in that it's 40 damage and a double punch
escape, but it's a RFF-only throw, so you'll have to be a bit creative if 
you don't want it escaped.  It's also a bit slower at 17 frames.  It is not 
the only throw from RFF (RFF f,f+2 still does the regular f,f+2), and the 
other command throws come out the same, so now you have something to look
forward to when mixing up.

Hwoarang literally throws his opponent with the left leg to the other side.  
You end in RFF, but the distance is too wide to matter... unless done 
opposite a wall.  Either way, this has got to be the sweetest throw in
the game.  (Jin's u/f+1+2 was cool for about two seconds, and then it just
became overused and expected)


[D14] This throw is Excellent in terms of damage, escape buttons and
looks, but very slow.  Uninterruptable after rff 2 hits, but this tactic 
alone won't get you far.

A nice little trick that I came across is 3+4~2.  A RFF throw out of LFF.
This version of the throw is more than 17 frames and should only be used
for style points.

f,f+2                 front     Roll & Choke                    2 

  Damage: 30
  F Hit: 12
  Advantage After Escape: 0 

Your opponent ends in PLD; you end in BT.


[3XL] This is easily the most versatile throw Hwoarang has.  The "f,f"
command means it's delayable.  And that means you have a throw that has
great distance, though the dash forward might be a clue that a throw
is coming up, and that its escape is 2.  I don't think it's a big problem
if you can mix it up.  Ways you can mix it up are:

f+3+4,f+2 - Quick stance switch into f,f+2
f+3+4,F, 2 - Delayed stance switch into f,f+2
f,N,d,d/f, f+2 - Crouchdash into f,f+2

The last one is two separate commands (hence the space), not one rolling 
motion.  It might be a bit confusing when snakedashing (explained later), 
but if it's confusing to you, it's definitely even more confusing to your 
opponent!

All this plus the fact that you switch sides and stand up BT means you can
Shadow Step and Fox Step, pretty much with impunity!  And yes, those will
be explained later.


[D14] Triple Lei pretty much explained everything, but I would like to add 
Okizeme strategy. Even though we are encouraging creativity and style in this 
faq sometimes you just need that tiny bit of health to win.

1. Turn around(F) and d+4,4. This will get the rollers as well as those who 
stand up. This will yield a juggling opportunity unless they roll to the side, 
interrupt, or lie there.  If they roll to the side they still get hit with d+4, 
but if they lie there they will avoid it( That is when you should use b+3 or 
db+4).

In order to interrupt , they have to do the rising kick as fast as possible.  
Db+4,4 will take care of those that do.

Overall the best mix-up is between d+4,4 and db+4,4.

qcb+3                 front     Door Mat                        1 

  Damage: 40
  F Hit: 11 
  Advantage After Escape: 0 

Your opponent ends in PLD.


[3XL] Due to its command, it's not a throw you can just... well, throw out,
but you should always keep it as an option.  The escape is 1, the damage is
40, and you might be able to add a d/b+4 (which is great), but the command 
isn't as easy as Paul's Deathfist.  In fact, it's -very- easy to mess up.  
You can make this easier on yourself by holding 1 so that it's qcb+1+3.  
Even if you mess up, you'll get another throw, which is excellent in itself 
with a double punch escape.  It comes out in 11 frames instead of the usual
12, but the command makes it pretty much impossible to take advantage of
that fact.  It's a very pretty throw, though.


[D14] Damn, this throw has a lot of sparks. A good throw for mix-up , but
yields very little oki in your favor. Anything you throw out can be escaped
by rolling  back. If they don't you can add damage with db+4 and B+3.
Nonetheless, one of his best!

  F Hit: 12
  Advantage After Escape: -6

Your opponent ends in PLD.


[3XL] Well, that "Advantage After Escape" had to be for -something-, and
here it is... a whopping -6.  Honestly, it wasn't ever a problem for me,
since the double punch escape made escapes much less frequent, and pretty
much no one knows it's -6 (I know I didn't until I started writing this
FAQ!), so forget about it.  It's a weird command, but it's worth it.

Your opponent also ends up in a very dangerous situation.  Anyone who played
Jin in Tekken 3 (and who didn't!) knew the joys of landing a single Hell
Sweep, what with d+1 (OB), WS+2 madness.  Try a whiffed d/f+1+2, and then
interrupt a PLD 3 with your d+3,4, b+3; a combo that's all guaranteed.


[D14] db+4 is guaranteed after to make this throw 42 points of damage!!!

  Damage: 30
  F Hit: 12
  Advantage After Escape: 0 

Your opponent ends in PLD.


[3XL] This is a fine, fine throw; a throw which I should use more often.
It's another double punch escape, and it has some buffer ability. The fact 
that it requires a f and 2 motion may hinder your ability to perform it, 
since f,f+2 is the command for another throw.  When buffering, be sure to 
hold 2 and press 3, -and not the other way around.-

(hold 2), f,f+3
(hold 2), f,N,d,d/f, f+3


[D14] To all the people that customize the R1,R2,L1,L2 buttons that 2+3 is not 
one of the commands you can perform this throw by pressing F+ 2+4 or 1+2 while 
buffering 3.You can do this throw without buffering by pressing F~3~2+4/1+2 

NOTE: You will not be able to do things that Triple Lei mentions above with 
this method.

has the much better RFF 2.  And don't even think about doing multiple left
jabs in juggles like Jin or Bryan... the recovery is pretty poor.  If you
must, you can chain into the 1,2,3 and 1,2,4 strings, but even still, you'd
be better off starting with 2,3 or 2,4.


[D14] Against 10 framers on block, this can be used as a set-up for CH 2,f+4.
But considering that all of the moves are high, this should be used VERY rarely.
Also the tactic above is interruptable by anyone's low punch.

[3XL] It's the better of the LFF jabs, if you're into that sort of thing.
The opponent has a much harder time seeing the 1,2,3 and 1,2,4 strings from
just 2, so stuff like 2,3, f+3 and 2,4, 2 makes for a quick offense.


[D14] CH 2,f+4(2,f+3 if it is not CH and they duck) can come out of this.

[3XL] It's a move Hwoarang needs, especially against bulldoggers.  After it
hits you can go into WS+4,4, mixing up with other low moves and basic throws.  
But you probably don't need -me- to tell you this.  u/b+4 can be a nice move
to throw out as well... and you don't even have to crouch cancel!


[D14] The fastest jab that Hwoarang has. A universal interruptor that will 
get you out of very tight situations. Can be low parried if used in a 
predictable manor. You can mix up between D/B+4,WS+4,4 and even a throw after 
the jab hits. Even though this move has 0% flash, it is a must sometimes.

[3XL] No, you definitely don't want to do this move by itself.  It's high
and slow, but you might have some success stringing the rest of the attacks.
3,3,3,3, however, just tells everyone that your level of scrubbery is coming
along nicely...  Honestly, I don't even know why I'm putting this down...


[D14] Don't use this move by itself.

[3XL] Sadly, this move doesn't give you that catch combo on CH... you know,
4 CH, f,f+4, d/f+2, etc.  No stagger or anything.  You'd be better off
stringing and mixing up the full attack, though 4,4,f+4 does pretty good
damage for juggles.


[D14] By itself, a bad move.

[3XL] It's just as crappy as the standard 1 (maybe even worse, looking at the
frame data), but it does one more point of damage.  You don't even get any
special, magical properties...


[D14] Hwoarang dashes in a little more to get that 1 point of damage he 
desperately needs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[3XL] Not much to say here... these are pretty much all great moves since
you can do them from either LFF or RFF.  Great for having an offensive flow,
but the Liquid Style frowns on using these moves exclusively.


[D14] Exactly, using these moves without using spacing, movement and style
in NOT what this Faq is about. The funny thing is some of these moves never 
get used while you are in RFF. When was the last time you did a Sky Rocket 
or The Hunting Hawk out of RFF?

[3XL] By itself it's not much, but you can definitely go for a psychological
game here.  Hwoarang has a quick launcher from LFF 1+2 with 3 (4 from RFF 
1+2 which launches unlike in TTT).  A BT 2+4  throw comes out very quick, 
with very surprising range.  Last but not least, you can start the Jinguu 
style Fox Step, where you can start the whole mind game over again.  Don't
forget that you can SS from this; deftones14 cover this later.

There was also the idea of 1+2~B into RFF 3~4, but meh...  Hwoarang turns 
around two different ways, and only one of the ways disguises the Backlash.
Eh...


[D14] Love  this move  due  to  the  opportunity of a FOX STEP.  The  above 
mentioned tactics by Triple Lei also apply.  If you want a flashy non-sense 
combination from this that get's you nowhere press 1+2(wait for the animation 
to finish) 1+3.  Hwoarang is definetely the best dancer in T4!!!

[3XL] Oh, you all know what this is.  But no one just uses 3+4 alone.  The
most frequent use of 3+4, besides Crazy Legs (explained later), is with a 
buffered dash.

f+3+4,f
b+3+4,b

The former allows for a dash RFF attack, and the latter is most often used
to make attacks whiff for a free RFF 3~4.  As far as stance switches go, 
sidesteps serve that purpose (RFF to LFF) even better.  That's not even
getting into the u/b RFF cancel...


[D14] I second that :)

[3XL] Personally, I don't use this move that much.  That's not to say it's a
bad move.  In fact, it's just as good as Paul's d/f+1 (having the same
animation and all) - maybe even moreso for Hwoarang, since it is, after all,
a mid punch.  On a hit, it's a great set up for throws.  qcb+3 may work well 
for you here.


[D14] A far reaching body blow. f+2 is uninterruptable by a standing jab after
df+1+2 is blocked(Credit goes indirectly to Tbuxton ) I like df+1 over this, 
due to +1 on block.

[3XL] So it juggles on CH.  Big freakin deal.  It's not a WGF by any means; 
it's just a WS+2 from a crouch dash. It doesn't have the range, power, or
overall priority of the Sky Rocket, which is only one frame more.  And since
it's only good on CH, you could have done something really good, something
spectacular... something marvelous... but if you use this move, it shall
never be.


[D14] This move will go under high jabs(and juggle on CH) if timed right due 
to the crouch dashing motion as well as the jab avoidance on  certain frames 
of d/f+2.

In all honesty I'd rather do f,N,d,d/f+4 over this, because of the greater 
damage potential.  In order for this move to make contact you only need to 
reach the extended limb of the other character. A pretty good move overall.

[3XL] I like this better than that crouch dash uppercut.  If you're close to
your opponent and -not- in Flamingo, you can try this move in hopes that it
will duck jabs, hit on CH, and launch.


[D14] This is one of Hwoarang's better defensive moves. The animation is the 
same as the version above, but without the crouch dash motion. This move is 
used for defense, unlike the crouch dashing version which is primarily used 
for offense.

This move will override certain jab combinations done consecutively. Just a 
few examples where this move becomes a useful tool.

Jin's 2,1, 2,1 (d/f+2 will interrupt in-between)
Laws's 1,2,3, 1,2,3 (d/f+2 w.i.i.)

[3XL] Hwoarang jumps and does a high overhead attack.  Really, there is always
a better move for each time this could ever hit.


f,N,d,d/f+4, u/f+2
 - b+3 is NOT guaranteed if this hits.  Besides, 3+4, 3~4 does more damage.

3+4, 3~4 (wall), u/f+2
 - Same thing.

Jumping over low attacks and grounded attacks
 - This will hit stuff like Paul's d+4,2, but if you anticipated it in the
   first place, u/f+3,4,3 could have done much more.
 

The surprise from the move being thrown out in the first place could have
been worth something, but it's not quick enough for stuff like baiting and
parrying KND 3s, like Kazuya's f+4.  Pass...


[D14] I really haven't seen too many people use this move as their primary 
strategy, although the frame advantage is enough for anyone to start some form 
of offensive. It comes out very slow, doesn't do too much damage and also can 
be ducked; but for a surprise tactic can be used to some effect.

[3XL] Although this move has range, it's best when you anticipate something
so you can do this move out of a SSR and hit the side.  Your opponent will
go flying!

It also seems that this move's hit range is different, depending on if your
opponent is close or far (kinda like Kuma's f+1+2).  But you shouldn't have
to worry about this.


[D14] This move along with f+2 are the best jab interceptors. This move will 
beat out any jab string just outside the 1st jabs reach. This move becomes 
even more effective when a SSR proceeds it. It will give you the breathing 
space that you sometimes desperately need and put you back on offensive. 

On CH/sideturned/backturned you will get a knockdown along with space. On a 
regular hit you only get space. On block however you are a sitting duck for 
just about any power shot that has range. Use this move at the right time and 
place and you won't be faced with too many situations where you are a sitting 
duck.

[3XL] This jumping kick knocks down and puts you in Flamingo, but it's not 
all that safe or flashy... or damaging.  If you are feeling cocky you can 
hop over your opponent's KND 3.  But I like doing u/b+4 in that case, and 
it'll hit.


[D14] This can be used as part of the wake-up game , but shouldn't be used 
for primary offense. It's both slow and hits high, you definitely have better 
options. Parabellum Kicks(PBK(LFS f+3)) are uninterruptable after this on 
block and on a laying opponent a whiffed U+3, LFS d+3,4 can be used. Probably 
one of Hwoarang's worst moves in terms of set-ups. This move creates a minor 
wall stun.

[3XL] This move looks good on paper, but most of the time it won't hit.  This
has a tendency to whiff, even when it shouldn't.  It's damaging and knocks
down, but it's a bit slower to execute.

To give you an example of how slow this move executes (or how fast RFF 3~4
recovers), let me say that in a Hwoarang VS Hwoarang match, I ducked a
RFF 3~4, hoping for a free WS+3.  This happened twice, and both times, he
was able to duck!  Now, it may be guaranteed, but as far as reaction time
goes, just settle for WS+4,4.

Far out applications of this move include CD cancels into WS+3 and juggle
enders.  But WS+4,4 better here, too.


[D14] Even though WS+4,4 gives you better results this is still a good move 
if you ducked a high attack. If you the reaction skills to pull this move 
out at the earliest possible frame of animation you can punish everyone's 
1,2 and even interrupt some jab strings.

Paul's 1,2,3 (very hard)
Heihachi's and Kazuya's 1,2,2 , 1,2,4 (medium)

Unlike WS+4,4 however this gives you a Knockdown and space, the trade-off is 
extra 3 frames of animation.

[3XL] Two kicks; delayable, damaging kicks that hit mid, are guaranteed CH...
and are boring.  This kills your momentum, but I think it works surprisingly 
well from LFS, such as mixing up d+3,4 with 3,4.


[D14] It's a safe, powerful, mid hitting, delayable move. On CH both kicks 
connect and give you great damage. Personally I rarely throw this one out, 
because it doesn't have good reach; it's very easy to whiff the first kick
and finding yourself eating a CH power shot. Overall a good move, but this 
will slow your momentum down a lot.

[3XL] Low (looking) kick, high kick.  This TTT move strings d+3 and f+4.
Unless you know you're going to hit and interrupt a BT opponent (like
when interrupting PLD 3 for a free d+3,4, b+3 combo), don't just throw this
out.  What you want is to do this move from LFS so the first kick hits low
instead of special mid.  The fastest, easiest way to do this is with 2,3,
but that may be a sign that you're going to do this.  Well, you all know how
to mix up, right?


[D14] This shouldn't be used to start your offense. The two main uses of this 
not so good move is either to pick up your opponent from the ground when they 
roll or to hit them from the side or the back. If you manage to connect this 
from the side or the back I recommend following this move with RFS b+3 and a 
juggle. You can press F after this move to end it quickly in LFF and block a 
rising attack if the opponent ducks the move.

[3XL] Baek's signature kick (well, IMO).  This jumps over low attacks and
delivers three guaranteed, damaging kicks, but this move has poor recovery
on whiff, and has no tracking ability at all!  You can even be jabbed out of
this for a juggle.

While this is safe on block, the poor tracking ability can sometimes throw
you off course if this was blocked off axis.  (it happens).  And NO, that
JF u/f+3:4:3 thing is in Tekken 3 only!!!! (...I think.)


[D14] Although this move is slow it has very good range. This is definitely 
one of Hwoarang's flashier moves as the two kicks hit in the air and the 
third smacks the opponent on the ground like a baseball bat. If the first 
two kicks are blocked you gain good advantage to start a strong offensive, 
however it's very easy to sidestep the first kick. Never use this on top of
the wall, because the third hit always misses for some reason. If you do 
manage to pull this off, your Okizeme consists of b+3 or f+any throw. If 
they roll back sometimes B+3 will miss, but f,f+3 will work in those rare 
situations.

Even though the numbers above look pretty good, don't forget about the damage 
formula in a juggle. (100%,80%,40%...) In reality this move does 36 points of
damage.

[3XL] One of the few Class 1 launchers in the game.  3+4, 3~4 is the most
reliable juggle ender, and it's still one of the most damaging.  Overused,
but what can you do.

Something I found out in Tekken 3 that is infinitely more useful in Tekken 4
is this little doozy:

f,N,d,d/f+4, f,f,f+4, 2 (© 2002 Triple Lei)

f,f,f+4 is really a dash f+4.  By the time the RFS 2 hits, you switch sides.
If you do this when your back is against against a wall, you can pull off
a RFF f,f+3 just as the guy's front hits the wall!  I have yet to do this
in an actual match, but hey... it's supremely awesome by itself.

Oh yes, the move's only bad point is its recovery, since on block you can
eat pretty much any quick power strike.  Luckly the JF version is completely
safe on block, and on my stick, at home, on the 1P side, I don't think it's
TOO hard!


[D14] This is Hwoarang's second best juggle starter. The combos out of this 
move do the most damage. The only weakness that the Sky Rocket has is the 
recovery time. Paul's Deathfist along with the Mach Breaker will be flying 
your way, unless... ... you can do the JF version. In that case you have a 
retaliation-proof launcher.

[3XL] Hits low and then high for a juggle.  But if you don't do this on CH,
go buy yourself a nice Vanilla Coke and reward your curiosity, since it's
Game Over.  By now everyone knows to duck the second hit.  And no, you can't
just throw out the first hit; by itself it has crappy execution AND recovery
time.  The juggles from this move aren't as good as a regular b+3.  d/b+4,4
is just quicker, safer, and more rewarding for a low kick guaranteed on CH.


[D14] This move is not that good in terms of actually getting both hits to 
connect. Not only is this slow, but the second kick is ducked on reaction by 
most and you are at -6 even if the first kick hits. If your opponent doesn't 
give you breathing space, forget you even have this move at your disposal. 
However with a little distance and CH hunting this can used to some effect. 
The first kick does have a long reach.

[3XL] This move replaces the crappy d/b+4,4 from previous games with a double
kick!  The first kick is the same animation wise, but it doesn't turn the
opponent sideways anymore for that somewhat-guaranteed f+3~3... but hell,
d/b+4,4 is guaranteed by itself on CH (and b+3 after that)!

On block it turns opponents sideways and I'm sure there is some good stuff
there, but if you only use this move the way you're supposed to (that is,
on CH only!), you shouldn't have to worry.

The 2nd kick is high, not mid, so again... CH ONLY!


[D14] This is one of Hwoarang's best weapons at a medium distance. It's fast 
for a low attack and the damage is also pretty good. You can follow this up 
with B+3 to make this combo 53 points of damage on CH. If they block the 
second kick they are side turned so you can continue with your offense. The 
first kick hits grounded and if they are trying to roll the second will hit 
as well. The second kick tracks side-steppers very nicely.

The only downside of this move is that if the opponent ducks the 1st kick and 
you continue with the 2nd kick, you will be eating a rising attack. When this 
is thrown out when anticipated by the other player, even if the 1st kick hits, 
the 2nd will get ducked. Don't overuse this and this will be a terrific weapon 
at a medium distance.

[3XL] I know I'm in the minority, but I absolutely love this new move.  When
I thought about what this move really is - an attack that retreats and attacks
at the same time - I started using this move a lot more.  And at least against
WeaponX, it connected a LOT, most often on CH for that nice blue sparkle of
pure Hwoarang ass-kicking power.  Baiting is easy... when your opponent starts
bulldogging, you do this move!

It's not invincible; the move has poor recovery (poorer than you think), and
if anticipated, your opponent can just jab and you'll pop up for a juggle.
However it's that property that allows you to escape Jin's quick JFLS on hit
using this move!  (I don't know who to credit for that)


[D14] Hwoarang jumps back and does a roundhouse kick.  This is a purely 
defensive move, but doesn't have that many uses. On block you are screwed, 
but you are more likely to whiff this than get it blocked. This is not the
fastest attack that he has,  so anticipation is needed to use this move 
effectively. This works effectively against wave dashers before they get 
into your range to do an attack.  As a surprise attack this move is alright,
as an overused move (I've never met anyone who overuses this) this will get
you into trouble. Using this effectively is hard, because the kick itself 
has very little priority, so you are more likely to get hit in the process
than actually land this attack.

[3XL] Hwoarang always has a better move for every situation you would ever
want to use this move.  Like practically every other move in the game.  
However I did find out that from a blocked RFF 3~4, u/f+4 turns them around
(!) if they neutral blocked (which avoids b+3 if they active block).  That 
doesn't happen if they're anywhere near walls for some reason.


[D14] Personally I never use this, because Hwoarang has way better options. 
The kick is high and once ducked you are screwed. You do get a good amount 
of frames on block, but nothing guaranteed due to the distance that is 
created. By the walls however, this can have some use. This will turn your 
opponent backwards if they block while side-turned (credit indirectly goes
to Triple Lei). I don't recommend this version of the move. If you are by 
the wall a d/b+1 is guaranteed, if you can pull it off.

[3XL] Double axe kicks that hit mid (the 2nd one also hitting grounded).  It
doesn't have the meaty damage of Heihachi's WS+4,4, nor does it knock down,
but it's quicker than WS+3 - quick enough to interrupt - and it puts you in
RFF.  Crouch dash cancelling into WS+4,4 is still just as good as ever; truly
the lost Tekken 4 art.  

However, this move has absolutely no tracking.  If your opponent techrolled,
that would be a sufficient SS in itself.  Despite that, it's been a staple
of Hwoarang players since Tekken 3, because the move is just really good!


[D14] This is one of the better moves in the game. Not only does Hwoarang 
have the best version of the Tsunami kicks, it also puts him in his better 
stance (RFF). This you best interrupter/punisher after ducking a high attack 
or after blocking a low attack. It's extremely easy to interrupt jab strings 
with this move after ducking the high punches(well at least a lot easier than 
with WS+3).This move can be done without ducking by inputting d~d/f(d/b)~N,4,4. 
A lot of times this will be one of the few moves that you will be able to use 
if you are under pressure.

You can buffer this move out of just about anything Hwoarang has. If you hold 
D/B before Hwoarang finishes the proceeding move and release D/B and press 4,4 
right as you see him duck a little you should get his fastest version of the 
Tsunami Kicks. This is faster than IWS (Instant While Standing), because you 
skip not only the d,d/f,N motion, but also frames of ducking animation. The 
interesting thing about this way of doing the move, is that you control how 
much you want Hwoarang to duck, before releasing the tsunami kicks.

If you want to do this move with the above method by itself, you will have to 
duck a bit more than if you would have done it after a move. So I recommend 
the IWS method if you want to do the tsunami kicks from a standing position.

This move is a must in your play.

[3XL] Simply put, you'd only really want to use 1,2,(3_4) in juggles, or on
absoltely petrified opponents.  2,(3_4) is always the better choice for a
close assault, since people can now expect that you do 2,3, d+3,4.


[D14] The most often used Flamingo starter. Some people like using one punch 
to give the opponent less time to react, others( like me ;) like to do 2 to 
tell the opponent that a mix-up is coming. On hit the mix up from flamingo is 
much more effective than on block. 1,2 has more range than 2 and looks a bit 
flashier, but IMO 2 is still a better starter for a surprise. 

1,2,3 b+4 is guaranteed from the back. By itself 1,2,3,N can be used to create
Fl.cancels.

A great new addition to Hwoarang's jab game that is being overused by a 
lot of Hwoarang players.

[3XL] Even if these moves -are- safe (and I'm sure they are), your flow stops

better.


[D14] A good move. Not as useful as it was in TTT, because now Hwoarang can 
get into flamingo from the punches. The last hit which is Mid is uninterrupt-
able after 1,2/(2) is blocked. It's a safe move, but you can loose your 
momentum is it's blocked.

[3XL] These moves are still pretty good.  In TTT these were the equivalent
the "I can't stop to think so I'll just do this move for good damage" juggle
enders, but now you have plenty more options.  You can get 1,2,f+4 with this:

RFF d/f+4~f CH, b+3, 2,3, 1, f,f, 1,2,f+4

Which, as far as I know, is the most "fulfilling" juggle ender in that case 
(unless you're near a wall).  And of course 2,f+4 (formerly TTT's 2,4) is
still great on CH for a meaty two-hit knockdown.  It may be a little harder
to do, but it's not EWGF hard or anything.  But if you're not absolutely,
positively, 100% sure it WILL hit on CH, 2,3, f+3 or 2,4, f+4 would be best.


[D14] Same as above, only this move does more damage and can be ducked.2,f+4 
is guaranteed on CH and will do somewhere from 56 points to 60 (if you CH an
unblockable). Other than that, it shouldn't be used at all.

[3XL] This is a fun move that, IMO, is rarely seen.  It's sort of slow, but
it's nice, pretty powerful, and if it happens to hit, your opponent is at 
your mercy.  To top it off it hits mid and is a punch attack!  It's nice for
that surprise factor... and the move is actually good!


[D14] A nice addition to Hwoarang's game. Forget the 15 frames that this move 
takes. Look at the 10 frames that you get if you hit someone with this move.

A pure mix-up is possible after a hit.
F+2+3,F+2+4, CD+b+Qcb+3, CD+F+2   or   B+3,f+1+2,CD+4-interruptable 
If they block standing, throw them.
If they backdash or duck use a medium attack mentioned above.

If this move is blocked, the worst thing that can happen to you is a 3 hit 
strings starting with an 8 frame jab. Personally I never worry about this 
move being blocked.

[3XL] Let's face it: Hwoarang would have been that much better in past games
if he had aquick, mid juggle launcher that DIDN'T require a CH.  The answer 
to this isa LFF version of his RFF f+4~4 kick!  It's 100% guaranteed after 
parrying low kicks (giving you a small opportunity for a side wall stun), 
and it hits grounded, off-axis or not!

However it's extremely punishable when blocked, so please don't just throw 
this out like an EWGF.  If you can interrupt with this, then great; otherwise
just make this your secret weapon or something.  (Well -that- is not exactly
true; you -will- use this move a lot)



[D14] The best new addition to Hwoarang's punishing game. Can be used for 
Okizeme in certain situations (when you have enough time to use it). Can be 
used after low-parrying a kick attack. A rather slow kick with tremendous 
range.

Moves that can be punished with b+3:
Paul:qcf+2(only if blocked at close to medium distance),ws+2,d+1+2,1,2,3
Jin:d+3+4

[3XL] Ugh.  Two jabs, low kick, high kick...  I've always found that 1,1 by
itself was the best part.  In fact one of the things I used to do was this:
1,1, d/f+1, d/f+1+2 - It was easy to chicken, so hey.  However with the new
1,2 into Flamingo, I don't know why anyone would want to do this move.  I'm
sure at some point in the string, the rest is guaranteed, but who the hell
cares.  You certainly shouldn't.  It might have limited success with walls 
if it wasn't so predictable...


[D14] An ugly ass move. Not effective by itself, because everyone and their 
grandma knows when to parry the low kick. Quite effective when a mix-up is 
introduced.  1,1,3,3-for those who will interrupt, or are introduced to the 
mix-up.

1,1,d/f+1- for those that will duck/low parry/block. d/f+1 gives you +1 on 
block, so a d/b+1 in uninterruptable (once again mix up d/b+1 with a mid 
attack if your opponent has caught on and keeps parrying you).

1,1, any throw- for those who use the d/f~n method (the df~n method is used

[3XL] This move may have had its uses in previous Tekkens, but I don't care
for it.  It's fairly safe, and theoretically, you can mix up those RFF 
attacks... but I always prefer iWS+4,4 of cd~b+4,4.  As a fast mid attack,
I always prefer d/f+1, especially against walls.  No one really uses this,
so no one really sees this, which means it's great for variety.

Ok, so I lied.  If you're feeling confident, you can do this move after a
RFF f+4~4.  Just try RFF f+4~4, u/b, f+2.  If the built-in mini SS from 
RFF f+4~4 was big enough, f+2 would send your opponent spinning to the side.
Tech roll trap?  You'd better belive it.

So why would anyone ever want to do F+2 to recover in LFF?  I'm still working
on that one myself...


[D14] Excellent move! Paul's cheesy ass 1,1,1,1 crap is stopped by this. This 
move ducks the jab's at certain frames of animation that leads to a hit. I 
would say great against Jabs if you are at -1 on block. Against jabbers this 
is one of the 4 moves that can help you out tremedously.

On hit rff 2 is uninterruptable and rff df+4 seems to tie with an 8 frame jab
(In a heated battle you have an advantage, because you know what you are 
going to do, while they have to think about their action first).

"Last i forgot to mention d/f+2 or f+2 interrupting lees ss+2~f+1,2,44 after
the ss+2."

[3XL] A downward axe kick that puts you in RFF.  In past Tekkens, as much as
we wanted it to, it didn't hit grounded opponents lying absolutely still (it
got everyone if they flinch). Now in Tekken 4, it hits Kuma and Marduk lying
still (though I wouldn't call Marduk a "biggie"), and it gets everyone if
they are on a slope, or at least on raised ground!  Experiment with those
bumpy windows on Building C.  

But honestly, you probably won't get to see that happening to much.  f,f+3
used to be almost guaranteed after a blocked RFF 3~4, but there are better
mix-ups in Tekken 4 in this situation.

Hrmm... tensaikun likes to catch techrollers on the rise with a f,f+3 from
a crouch dash... it doesn't work all the time, but hey.


[D14] This is more of a variety attack rather than something used very often.
You get good frame advantage on block and you can buffer then f+2+3 out of 
this. This move catches those who twitch on the ground and can be used as 
Okizeme. Somewhat easily avoided if expected and rather slow. It is up to you
where to use this move, because it doesn't have that much priority.

[3XL] A damaging, probably physically impossible, mid-hitting double kick.
Don't worry about the chicken command (according to tragic's Tekken 3 Manual
Act. 1, both kicks needed two separate chicken commands), since it's hard and
weird to reverse in the first place.  And it's usally the first kick (3) that
would get reversed.  Anyway, this is a great juggle filler or ender.

Since you jump a little before you start kicking, be careful not to get jabbed
since that's a free floater right there.  That also means it's best when used
at a distance... which is why I like doing this after Fox Steps.  If you're
lucky enough to connect with this against walls, a Backlash is guaranteed.


[D14] This is a pretty good move for Hwoarang in this Tekken. In juggles it 
can be used either as the 2nd and the 3rd hit(B+3,cd+4,BT4/3,rff f+4~4) or 
the juggle finisher.

Both hits are mid and nothing is guarateed on block for your opponent. However
at 21 frames, this move comes out fairly slow. The trick to this move is that 
the starting animation makes the opponent block rather than interrupt. If you
do get interrupted with a jab, get ready for a floating combo.

This move creates a Wall stun, so you can quickly switch stances and do a 
backlash(3+4,3~4).

[3XL] One of two mashable kick strings.  Thankfully they pretty much suck.
I won't bother going into detail (since I'm sure deftones14 will do that,
and better), but you can try to make your opponent stand up backwards after
a baited PLD 3 from d,D/B+1+3 with (3,3),d+3,4, b+3.

You could return to LFF after certain right kicks in these strings, but who
cares.


[D14] 3,3,3<3-This version is excellent when you have your opponent against 
the wall with their back to you(This string is un-techable and does a 
tremendous amount of damage). It can be used in regular combos for minimal 
damage, but by itself do not use this. The only thing you can do with this 
is delay the last kick to catch impatient players. However everyone knows 
that they can duck the last hit.

3,3,3<4,4-End this on the first 4 and you are in RFS, end this on the second 
4 and you are in RFF. A lot safer than the above string, but doesn’t get you 
anywhere unless they interrupt in-between or you end this at an unexpected 
point. They can still duck the 1st 4 and interrupt you with a WS(very hard 
in a heated battle)or a d/b+1(easy).

3,3,d+3,4,4-If the 3rd hit connect so does the 4th.You can start an insane 
mix-up from RFS(end the string at the 4th hit),because you get an insane 
frame advantage(+21).This string and the one above can’t be used as a true 
mix-up because the df~n method works against both strings.

3,3,4,4-This version is used if your opponent reverses the above strings at 
the 4th hit.

Honestly, I rarely use the above strings as part of my main offense. They are 
all somewhat safe, but at the end they don’t get you very far in terms of 
damage/set-ups and flow. The more you use these, the crappier your Hwoarang 
looks.

[3XL] One of the two RFF f+4~4 look-alike BT launchers.  Unlike in TTT, this
launches, and without a tag!  (hold for applause... 3... 2...)  This can 
sorta be used as a surprise, but probably only once, if that.  Good after
Fox Stepping, but try not to make it obvious.


[D14] The best version of Grand Theft that he has. At 14 frames this move is 
a killer for it’s range. I mostly use this move when I start messing with my 
opponent in the mind-game department.1+2,(BT)3 will get those who impatiently
for the trick. The main use for this is after a successful Fox Step(when they
whiffed a move).Doesn’t cover as much ground as it’s LFF cousin, but still 
more then it’s RFF Cousin.

[3XL] Although it's powerful and kinda quick, there are only two place where
you'd want to use this over any other move.  The first is after a wall push
(medium / far).  The second is to try for some nasty crap if b+4 hits on CH.
I don't want to make deftones14 sound like a broken record, so I'll just let
him explain.


[D14] The only bad thing about this move is that it hits high. 28 points of 
damage, comes out in 12 frames and side-turns the opponent on CH are it’s 
good points. The fact that you SS left within the animation is also a plus. 
Some consider it a must in their play, but I hardly use this move. Still one 
of Hwoarang’s best.

By the wall, a CH b+4,2,f+4~4,3~4 is almost guaranteed unless they duck. In 
case that use CH b+4,f+4~4,3~4. (credit indirectly goes to Tensaikun)

[3XL] Ok, there is absolutely no time you'd want to do a full f+4,4 string
unless your opponent hasn't seen it in over two years and you want to go
for the surprise K.O.  And f+4 by itself is ok since it's sorta safe, but
then again it's not the fastest move.  A note on the properties here: the
2nd hit only knocks down if f+4 whiffed!  So (f+4),4 CH probably won't
happen in THIS lifetime.


[D14] Some people like to use the first part of the string to get into RFS. 
On block you get +7, so a lot of things are possible. If you choose to use 
the whole strings you are safe on block, but loose your momentum. Never 
really use this.

[3XL] f,f+4 soars over floored opponents, and since you would normally end 
BT, you would now face forward after body crossing.  In my experience, I've 
done this move after knocking down someone (buffered from a crouch dash).
When he wanted to hit me with a KND 4, he stood up backwards, and I had 
enough time for a back throw (though d+3,4, b+3 + combo would be better). 
The fact that it has zero tracking can be a good thing or a bad thing.  Just
remember that you buffer this from a crouch dash with f,N,d,d/f, N, f+4.

It's also a stylish juggle ender, and if you're close enough, you can try a
Reverse Fox Step so when they tech, you're in prime throwing postion from BT.
And who suspects that??


[D14] Considered crap by many I actually like to use this move. If you are 
within range(after this hits) and they don’t react fast enough d+3,4,b+3 is 
possible from the back. A good combo ended as well as a Wall Combo-ender.

I sometimes use this as part of my Oki strategy. At close range this will go 
over them and they might rise with a kicking attack in the wrong direction.

[3XL] The only other mashable kick string.  Oh no!

4,4,4,(3_4) - Equivalent to Jun's 1+4,2,(4_d+4) string mix-up, only it's not
quite as fast.  I'm surprised at how people don't expect a low kick, and the
payoff is great! (free d/b+4,4).  Once your opponent expects this, try to go
for 4,4,4,4 against walls.  The last hit gives a wall stun and puts you in 
RFF for your free RFF 3~4.  Only 4,4,4,3 is punishable on block.

4,4,(b+4_4_f+4) - 4,4,b+4 puts you in LFF.  Nice to know I suppose, and in
TTT there was a NICE combo on Jacks using this (RFF f+4~4 CH, u/b, 4,4,b+4,
f,f+4 if you must know), but there aren't times Tekken 4 where is supremely
advantageous (I hope I'm wrong).  4,4,4... you might as well do a full mix-up
with 4,4,4,4 or 4,4,4,3.  4,4,f+4 does nice damage; HHH's combo video has
RFS d/f+4, 4,4,f+4 on Xiaoyu.

You shouldn't really care about the rest...


[D14] 4,4,4,4/4,4,4,3- If the opponent blocks the 1st 3 hits of either string 
a mix-up is possible. The last 4 is mid(1st string) and the last 3 is low(2nd
string). If you trip them(3) d/b+4,4 is guaranteed. If you get the 4,4,4,3 
string on CH or by the wall,IWS+4,4(My method) is possible. If the opponent 
block the 4, you are at a safe disadvantage, if he/she blocks the 3, you are 
eating a WS attack.

4,4,f+4/4,4,b+4- The 1st string ends in RFF, the 2nd one in LFF. Use these 
strings as a set-up for wall juggles and your overall wall game. In juggles 
the 3 kicks do a good amount of damage, but by themselves their use should be 
minimal.

4,4,4- This strings ends in RFS. A good version of the string that can create 
a confusion as you enter Flamingo. On block you are at –1 as you enter 
flamingo, but no one should interrupt(unless you get predictable), because 
they might be expecting you to finish the string.

4,f+4- This string end in RFF.The only use for this that I can think of is 
using this if your opponent ducks the initial kick.

4,3/4,f+3- The 1st string is better than the 2nd one, because you get more 
frame advantage on hit and less disadvantage on block. Both variations hit 
h,m so this is move is perfect for those that duck/SS the initial kick. On 
block you can Isw(Instant Side Walk(D/U)to escape a linear retaliation 
attempt.

This is Hwoarang’s better stance. You have more movement options, and your

B or F you will return to LFF. So the only way basic movement you have is the

[3XL] RFF 2,1 would be the equivalent of everyone else's 1,2 punch (more on
that later), but what you really want to pay attention to is just the RFF 2.
Frame advantage on everything = totally, unquestionably safe!  In previous
Tekkens, f,f,N, 2 was the combo filler for the more stylish juggles, but 
once again, 1,2,(3_4) makes this quite unnecessary.

Back to RFF 2,1.  Well, since RFF 2,1 is like everyone's 1,2, and after a
while, people tire of your jab annoyance and start ducking, this is a great
set up for RFF f+4~4!  Stuff like RFF 2~1, 2, f+4~4, etc.


[D14] The first hit itself will give you great frame advantage on block. 
Continuing the string won’t get you too far. Most people including myself 
rarely do the 1st 2 hits. A good string, but you definitely waste an RFF 
opportunity after you finish the string, because it is most likely to get 
blocked.

[3XL] Well, if you're in RFF and you think you're going to CH something, it
might not be a bad idea.  But as a juggle ender from LFS b+4... I still say
cancelling with u/b, then doing 2,4, 2, f,f, 3~4 [wall] would be better.


[D14] This is our good friend from RFF. On CH the opponent can duck the 2nd 
hit (very unlikely, unless conditioned), but CAN’T block it. So basically 2,3 
is like  LFF 2,f+4 , but better. You are safe on block, if you do miscalculate
the mind games. In other words, this should be used when you think the 
opponent will interrupt. What makes this a good choice for interruption is the 
insane frame advantage you get after RFF 2 on block.

This move is really useful in combos. Any time you launch with the right heel
lance (LFS b+4), do this and your opponent’s back is to you. If your opponent
happens to be by the wall, a properly timed 3,3,3<3 will take off a half of 
his/her life.

[3XL] RFF 2,4,(3_4) string together the RFF 2 jab into the respective RFF 4
chains.  RFF 2,4,3 was an ok juggle ender in TTT (IMO ugly and not damaging
enough), and I can't imagine RFF 2,4,4 ever hitting, since you can just duck
until you see the RFF 4,3 string, in which case you block high.  RFF 2,4,3
might be the best option as a juggle ender if you think your opponent might
wall tech before you're able to finish the juggle for Tony - T's patented
wall catch.


[D14] These strings can be used in juggles, but they give you minimal damage. 
The 2,4,3 version can be used for Oki (if someone blocks the last hit, you 
shall see a deathfist coming your way). The last kick hits grounded for 20 
points of damage. The 2,4<4 string has a delayable last kick, which will get
impatient people. Some people like to enter flamingo after 2,4,(2,4~F,U,D,B) 
although the frame advantage on this Flamingo entrance is definitely working 
against you.

2,4<4 creates a major wall stun if you get the last kick to connect. I use
these strings sometimes to create a variety of moves that I use. If not 
overused, these can have some value.

[3XL] The only, only application where this move is clearly the best option
is in this combo, courtesy of HHH's combo vid:

RFF 4~SSL CH, 2, f,f,N, 2,b+4


[D14] This move is for the people that like to attack after you finish your
jabs (2). Since your next jab (2) is uninterruptable, this move looses it’s
value.

This version of the b+4 has an automatic SS built in, so in case you whiff 
with your jab, you are likely to connect the kick, if they throw a linear 
attack.

I use this in juggles to add flash, but that’s about it.

[3XL] Generally, when people see you stay in RFF, they expect some RFF 2 jab
annoyance, or they stay cautious, not wanting to be juggled off a CH RFF 4, 
or they prepare for a double punch throw escape.  (RFF 3~4s should be thrown
out instantaneously).  RFF 3,3 is a slow, stupid low kick, followed by a
damaging high kick that telegraphs itself all over, has bad recovery, and is 
in no way guaranteed.

Obviously you should use just the first kick, but very, very sparingly, and as
a round finisher at that.  If you know exactly how your opponent is going to
block, then you can have a crappy mix-up of RFF 3 and RFF f+4,4.  The thought
of it never occurs to me in matches because neither of those moves has decent
recovery.

Perhaps the 2nd hit of RFF 3,3 may be "uninterruptible" if the first RFF 3 hit
near a wall for a stun, but meh.


[D14] A lot of people say that they can see the first 3 coming. I think if you
don’t overuse this, no one will see it. Sadly, the 2nd kick is interruptable 
even after the 1st one hits. What does that mean? Only use one kick. For a low
attack this has a good reach, but you are at a disadvatange after the first 
kick hits.

IMO, still a good move, it just doesn’t have ABUSABLE written all over it.

[3XL] For Hwoarang, this is -the- damaging move you look forward to after
meticulous planning, be it juggles or just punishing whiffed moves.  On
block, it can be just as good, as there is an evil mind game you can try:

.------------------------------------._.------------------------------------.

| u/b~N, Active Guard                |_| f,f, b+3                           |
`------------------------------------' `------------------------------------'

Credit for most of this goes to deftones14 (I think; it was in a PM).  I'm
sure he'll just cover this many times over, but I think this is important,
and I like tables.

Don't worry about the move hitting high; it has surprisingly good recovery.
Besides, if you're using it correctly - this is DEFINITELY not a move you
can just throw out - you shouldn't worry about that anyway.


[D14] Even though the damage got toned down, you can now run in and B+3 to 
add extra damage. The main use for this move is in the cd+4 juggle (cd+4,3+4,
3~4). It will give you the same 66 points of damage from earlier games. The 
other use for this move is when it gets blocked up-close. The correct way of
getting out of this mix-up is ub~B.

However most people press B to block. In this case do b+3, it will launch 
them and give you a free juggle. Some people like to leave the character in 
neutral to block b+3, in that case do a really fast cd+4. However you can be 
interrupted by a back kick from your opponent. In that case you have to wait 
for them to finish the kick and then juggle them. The mix-up is not as 
Hwoarang-friendly as I once thought it was, nonetheless things still work in
your favor.

This move also creates a Major Wall Stun. You can do two of these in a row 
to get around 110 points of damage. If the wall is on your right side, it is
more likely you will get a wall stun , because the move knocks you in that 
direction.

A lot of times you can be about 2-3 characters away and still get a wall stun. 
This move, being one of the slowest kicks Hwoarang posses recovers on a whiff
like no other. A lot of times you can block whatever your opponent throws out
after a whiff and punish them (depending on the move they throw out). Also 
the animation while this move can hit is very large, sometimes ducking 
impatient players will try to do a rising attack before the animation is 
finished, only to find themselves being knocked very, very far.

[3XL] Really good due to its frame godliness.  If your opponent is afraid
of ducking for some reason, you can try f+4, 2, f+3, 1, d/f+1...  I'm quite
sure this is uninterruptible.

I'd like to stress the fact that this can be done almost instantly in LFF!
I got the idea from Tekken Zone's Hwoarang Act. 6 (TTT).  Here it is:

F+3+4, 3

This isn't a 100% accurate notation (but heck, Zaibatsu's notation isn't
either), so I'll just explain.  You have to HOLD FORWARD the whole time, 
and then quickly press 3+4, then 3.  Sounds simple enough, but of course 
the part that requires some hand dexterity is the follow-ups.

f+3, 1
f+3, 3,4
f+3, d/f+3
f+3, 3+4, d/f+4
f+3, d+3,4
f+3, f+3

I have to say, the instant RFF f+3, d+3,4, f+4 is my signature string, so
don't be stealing. :D


[D14] Check out the frame advantage on hit.;) A very good way to get into 
LFS , even on block. You can practically do any more you want without being 
interrupted. That gives you the freedom to create a mix-up from the moves 
that you want to use. On CH PBK are guaranteed if done really fast. After 
this move you can press ~B to retreat and create a little bit of space. This
is one Hwoarang’s best, besides the fact that it hits high.

[3XL] Though I'm sure you can sorta set it up with 1+2 alone, this is neat
to do after a Fox Step.  deftones14 covers this pretty well later on.


[D14] This I use after a successful Fox Step. The range is terrific and this 
move executes in 14 frames. Punches are still guaranteed in blocked up-close.

[3XL] I think this is more useful on block.  It's slow, hits high, and has 
obvious wind-up, but at least he jumps.  On block, your opponent turns to
the side.  At this point you can expect a d+1 or some sort of retaliation.
It'll whiff entirely when you do a RFF b+4, which is -the- perfect follow-up.
I don't consciously do this move, but when I throw it out (and it's blocked),
I'm happy I did it.

There may be some nasty wall crap due to the way the opponent flies, but...


[D14] This kick has range and a side turn. You have the initiative ,because
they are off-axis. By the wall if you CH someone, you get a Major Wall Stun.
Has some uses, but not too many.

[3XL] Eh... so many good things from RFF.  Why have hamburger when you can
have steak?  LFF b+4 is great because it gets you into RFF and it has great
follow-ups on CH.  RFF b+3 gets you into LFF (like pretty much any other
move), and if there's a nasty follow-up, I haven't heard about it.


[D14] Umm, this is not as good as it’s brother, because you end up in LFF 
where you don’t have punches that give you frame advantage. A good move, but 
I think RFF 2,3 is better.

[D14] This move avoids linear attacks very well. It can be used after a RFF 
back step or just when you think they will jab you. Too bad it hits high, 
which makes this a dangerous attack to use if anticipated.

[3XL] I'm not too fond of either move.  I'm going to skip RFF 4,3 entirely,
and I'll just say that you have to delay the RFF 4,4 if you want both kicks
to hit on CH.


[D14] Remember the 2,4,3 and 2,4<4 strings?? Take away the punch and this is 
what you get. 

The only difference that’s worth noting is that after you get into Flamingo 
(4~F,U,D,B) you are at 0 frame advantage. This means that in a heated battle
your PBK(4~f,f+4) are most likely to hit someone who decides to interrupt.

[D14] This is the move of the Gods. After this always enter Flamingo. You 
have so many options, even on block. On CH and if you are close enough RFS 
b+3,d/f+4 are guaranteed (credit goes indirectly to Tensaikun). Hits mid, 
gives you advantage no matter what, guaranteed damage on CH, you couldn’t 
ask for more.

[3XL] RFF 3~4 can now hit from this launcher on off axis / fully side-turned
opponents, and directly on certain characters (King, Steve), and on everyone
against walls, so that's a plus.  I know deftones14 has written plenty on 
this, but I'll just say that besides the RFF jab annoyance mentioned in the 
RFF 2,1,1 comments, this is part of a new, sorta-guaranteed CH catch combo 
(by walls, anyway) by tensaikun.  :/

b+4 CH, 2, f+4~4, 3~4


[D14] This move is really good. After a successful RFF back-step you can 
throws this one out. I even think it avoids certain moves on certain frames. 
You are not safe on block, so certain characters can squeeze in a jab string
(though you have to be fast). However, you shouldn’t have this blocked too 
often, and if you are... you are not using this at the right moments.

[3XL] On CH, both hits connect... otherwise I don't see much use for this.
It's duckable otherwise, and the first kick by itself has unbelievably poor
recovery, so I pass.


[D14] The only move that Hwoarang has that gives you guaranteed RFF f+3 and 
RFF b+3. Too bad almost everyone ducks the last kick, even on hit. On CH , 
both kicks connect, but this move is easy to see coming. If you do use this,
use only the first kick and start using the second when they begin to punish
you after the first kick. It also gives you a Major Wall Stun.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: 3.6  Left Flamingo Arts (LFS) :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[3XL] This is probably the most used Flamingo stance.  Not only because it's
so easy to get into: triple sidesteps, quick interrupting attacks, and the 
ever-popular LFS d+3,4 (the first hit being low, not special mid) are also
available.


[D14] Considered by many the better of the two stances, I think I have to 
agree. The mix-up in this stance is very effective, but other than that the
two stances remain similar. The main difference between this stance and RFS
is the addition of d+3,4 and the lack of a juggling Axe-kick(d/f+4). This 
stance is somewhat more string-based.

[3XL] You can do f,f moves from this!  ...ok, this isn't -that- great.  jjt /
KOFTEKKEN's "Advanced TTT Techniques" FAQ said to do f+3, and then when his
foot touches the ground, you press f+[button].  There is perhaps only one
good use for this, and it's one of those things where you have to rely on
the surprise factor for something that will probably work once on the same
person (credit: Jinguu): f+3, N, f+4 = f,f+4.  I actually did this at SHGL
- Southern Hills Golfland, home of the fiercest SoCal comp - and it hit
(surprise!) WeaponX.  And what a surprise it was... it got "ooh's" and "ah's"
from TieTYT and / or White Rob! :)


[D14] By doing this you can do Fl.cancels. However, only after certain ways 
of getting into flamingo.

[3XL] The more obvious use of this is for flashy combos (most often starting
with RFF f+4~4, f+3).  The latent abilities are confusion and feigning attack
recovery to punish with Parabellum Kicks.  More on that later (by deftones14).


[D14] Use this to switch stances, create confusion, add flash or cover ground.

[3XL] It's the old f+2.  Since it's from LFS, you can do the 10-string.  It's
not totally useless from the side; a good part of the 10-string will juggle!
Credit goes to chittan for his TTT combo vid, and HoustonHardHitt for his
(unfortunately titled) T4 combo movie.  This is his combo:

LFS 2,2,3,4,3,4,3


[D14] It’s the rusty knife out of Flamingo. A good, safe mid move that covers
ground better than a punch. End a juggle with this before the opponent hits
the wall and tech-rolls. You are now in RFF and your good friends, the 
backlash(3~4) and Grand Theft(f+4~4) can be used to create some Wall Okizeme
( credit goes to Smaksu)

[3XL] Yes, well, I have a little history with this move.  Long believed to
be useless, I had posted in a thread titled "Frame Data can suck a fat one!"
saying that it's not amazingly good because it hits high.  Against the CPU
at least, I was punished every time.  But then I decided to use it because,
heck, since the move "sucked," it would be flashy to use it.  However, in
the back of my mind, those kicks were always fun to do for some reason, and
they were always great juggle enders against walls.  I guess I just hated
the move since abuse of it commits yourself to that boring, string-based 
style I hate even more.

So after a brief hiatus, WeaponX came over and I started using it, and I 
started testing.  I then realized three things:

 1) People, by default, block high.  That means you don't have to fear that
    match-ending WS+2 from Kazuya.  That is -the- WS move you have to worry
    about, but it's the slowest.  Even if Kazuya ducks the PB Kicks, chances
    are your opponent doesn't know how fast it recovers, so unless he does
    that WS+2 AS SOON AS the exact attack frames of your PB Kick are over,
    you'll interrupt it with another PB Kick.

 2) People don't realize how fast this move is, both execution and recovery.
    That means you not only can, but -will- interrupt a standing or ducking
    jab with those kicks if done consecutively - at least for a little while.
    One time I did it three times and interrupted twice, because my opponent
    thought it had crappy recovery.  His clearly audible, frustated grunt 
    made it all worthwhile. (my opponent was of course WeaponX, so ha ha :p
    ha ha omg he got hit by the same thing three times in a row rotflmao!)

 3) This move strengthens the LFS mix-ups.  Now your opponent can't expect
    to stop your Flamingo flow with a jab.  This is in contrast to #2; you
    also inspire fear in addition to baiting to interrupt, all of which add
    to your opponent's frustation, which I find incredibly humorous.

Among other uses, it stops people trying to sidewalk out of Flamingo strings
(and you can, but only a certain way, so it's still 50 / 50).  If blocked,
and you anticipate a jab (it happens), a LFS b+4 will duck and juggle at the
same time.  This excellent strat was brought up by some guy in the strat 
thread.  I'd take the time to search the thread and find his name to credit
him, if he wasn't such an unbelievable asshole (to me, of all people!) later
in the thread. deftones14 will cover this move later in the Flamingo section.
>>> *UPDATE* - the asshole has a name: it's bazooie.

Basically, as long as it wasn't ducked to begin with, you have the advantage.
So use this move, but know what you're doing!  You can't just throw it out,
hoping it's the end-all, be-all solution to your problems like Kazuya's ewgf.
The payoff is good but it's not game-breakingly good.

Special thanks to SMAKSU for quoting me in the strat thread, making me look
like the bad guy.  He's now my #1 forum enemy.  (so if you're reading this
right now you can take that smile off your face)


[D14] The fastest kick in the game that is mostly used to stop interruptors
and keep the Flamingo flow alive. On block this still gives you plenty of
options to keep your offensive. These are great when you are juggling right
on top of the wall. For a last hit they do about 30 points.

[3XL] Compared to the other mid-hitting juggle starter from LFS (LFS b+4),
this one's a lot safer.  However it's not as good as RFS d/f+4; the best
you can do from this is d/b+4,4.  I've seen people do an iWS+4,4 for more
ground options, but meh.


[D14] A good move, but not as good as it’s RFS counterpart. It’s safe on 
block; I still think that there are better(yet more dangerous options). 
Pretty good for creating a mix up between it and LFS d+3,4. Get this blocked 
and your flow is gone.

[3XL] Ew... yuck... it's stupidly powerful, telegraphs like crazy, and hits
high, but it doesn't avoid stuff.  I suppose you can do this combo for fun:
RFF f+4~4, f+3, b+3 - but meh.


[D14] Can be used in juggles for flash. Turns the opponent around on block 
and any retaliation attempt from them will be off-axis. The only thing they
can do is throw you to actually realign themselves and interrupt anything 
you throw out that is linear. In that case you can duck and retaliate. 
Unlike it’s RFF brother, this doesn’t avoid linear attacks.

[3XL] This is -the- most overused move by people who dedicate themselves to
that unbeLIEVEeably boring style of LFS d+3,4, 3+4, d+3,4, 3+4, d+3,4, b+3.
That's effective... unless you know how to sidewalk.  Anyhoo you only want
to do this move from LFS since -this- version hits low (and grounded)!  And
of course both of those kicks are guaranteed on hit.  Use it but don't trap
yourself.


[D14] This move introduced a whole new concept to the Flamingo strings. If 
this hits you get an insane amount of frames to do a lot of things. The 
first kick hits grounded and if you are by the wall you can LFS d+3,4,d+4 
for about 20 Oki points.

Probably the best new addition to Hwoarang.

LFS b+4, f+3, 1, 2,3, 3,3,3 [wall]

But I'm sure this was back in the days when no one realized there was such
a back tech roll, and as such this is probably totally techable.  Thanks
anyway, HHH!


[D14] This is the same as the LFF 3,3,3,3 string, just without the 1st hit.

Don’t use this unless you want to chain this out of 1,2,3 (on a back-turned

[3XL] It's part 2 of the safe mix-up of that instant RFF f+3 stuff.

RFF f+3, d+3,4
RFF f+3, 3,4


[D14] A safe move that will connect both hits if on CH. Flamingo offers better
options IMO. Also once you do this and your opponent blocks it, your flow is
gone.

[3XL] Given the amount of awesome moves from LFS alone, ranging from major

b+3, 3~4, 1,2,3, 4


[D14] Deals out good damage at the ends of long combos. Catches those who SS
your Flamingo attacks. Not a bad move, but very limited use outside of 
juggles, because it hit’s high. This move creates a Major Wall Stun.

[3XL] A great mid-hitting launcher from LFS in TTT, made almost exponentially
better in T4 due to new properties and walls.  It turns the opponent around, 
and when walls are near, you can land some nasty damage with either: 

RFF f+3,3,3
u/b, 2,4, 2, f,f, 3~4

It also ducks jabs, though I can't exactly credit this fellow.  In all, the
gods smile upon you when you land this move.  


[D14] By the walls, this your #1 friend. As it juggles it flips them. Follow
this with a move that completely turns them with their back to you(RFF 2,3 
d/b+4,4) and let the 3,3,3<3 madness begin. On block you are likely to catch
some fast moves or jab strings. This is one of those moves that you have to 
use in order to have a strong mix-up game out of flamingo, but also can be 
retaliated against.

[3XL] This slow, ground-hitting trip knocks down, but has a noticable delay.
Usually, after a LFS d+3,4, 3+4 (etc) thing, when people notice the fact that
you didn't immediately do another boring LFS d+3,4, they expect the -other-
move, and that's this.  iWS+4,4 hits from here, so it's not too bad.


[D14] A very slow kick that trips. By itself not too good , with other moves
included this has a purpose. If this gets blocked, you are eating a rising 
attack. On hit WS+4,4 can follow along with d/b+4 following the rising attack.

:: 3.7  Right Flamingo Arts (RFS) ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This stance also has valuable tools. It has a jab that will get you into RFF
and a juggling ax-kick as well as a stunning side-kick.

[3XL] Meh... you can't do that LFS, f = f,f trick with this.  But Jung Gijae
showed that you can do f,N+4, 3~4 to cleverly disguise a RFF 3~4.  (so no,
SMAKSU doesn't get credit for this!)


[D14] Flamingo cancels are possible out of this.

I'm sure there's probably tons of great stuff that I haven't thought of (or
stuff tensaikun's already figured out, damn him), so I'll stop here.

[3XL] Mmm, look at them frame stats.  Always good with 2,4, 2 and stuff.


[D14] This gets used by a lot of people, due to the frame advantage and the 
fact that you end up in RFF where you continue the RFF 2,2,2,2,2,2,2 party. 
Can also be used to set your opponent up for Backlash / Grand mix-up at the 
end of a juggle (credit goes to Smaksu)

but this simply does not hit most of the time.  Quick enough to trap SSers
but not as safe as PB Kicks.  Meh.


[D14] This will catch people that SS and end your Juggles in style. This move 
creates a Major Wall Stun.

[3XL] Guaranteed with a RFF d/f+4~f (CH) setup.  And probably the only time
you'd use it, too; LFS b+4 is just that much more easier to do.


[D14] The safer of the two lances, but RFS doesn’t have LFS’s d+3,4, so this 
doesn’t get used as often (because the mix-up is not as strong as it is in 
LFS). However, still a very good move.

[3XL] Why?  Eiw.  Rarely used, so there's the surprise factor... and it DOES
knockdown, but it's not that quick (i.e., it's damn slow), and it has a huge
guard stun, so... I dunno.


[D14] By itself, this sucks, however this has a use in a certain Flamingo 
mix-up. WS+4,4 can follow this if it hits. Sometimes both hits connect, esp 
if you are on an upward hill.

[3XL] Not very easy to get out.  It has a nice stun on CH, play with f,N+4.

Here was one of my (flashy!) TTT setups to get this to hit:

RFF f~b~f~b... 4~f, 2, f,f,N, 2, f,f,N, 2, cd~b+4, low parry, f,N+4, 4

I can guarantee it -won't- work in Tekken 4... you just can't sweep.


[D14] The tightest side-kick in the game;) It will stun on CH, but the stun 
can be escaped by someone who has really good reflexes.

You can either d/b+3+4 (can be interrupted), f,f+4,3, u/f+3,4,3, (only up 
close) d+3,4,3 after the stun.

it's used exactly the same way.


[d14] If it’s 8 frames and it keeps my Flamingo game alive, I like it... 
...and you should too;)Like it’s LFS counterpart, can be used in combos as 
the last hit on the wall.

[3XL] Much better than LFS d/f+3; this move juggles nicely on CH and is easy
to get out, what with Flamingo mix-ups and all.  Luckily this move will most
likely CH if it DOES hit (it's that type of move), and if blocked, you're 
safe too.


[D14] This is a powerful weapon. It juggles on both regular and CH hits. 
Although the juggle opportunities are better on CH. Gives you frame advantage
on block , hit’s mid, juggles, what else do you want? The only thing that is
completely uninterruptable is your d/b+1 after this, but advanced movement 
may yield greater options.

[3XL] ...


[D14] A decent move that I use once in a while. It hits grounded, so it can 
be used for Oki. It is faster than the sweep and even does more damage, so 
it can be used as a surprise attack.



==============================================================================
 4.  M O V E M E N T  A N D  B U F F E R I N G
==============================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: 4.1  Basic Movement :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Triple Sidesteps

  Well, this didn't take a genius to figure out.  In Tekken 3 at least, you
  had enough frame advantage for a guaranteed throw attempt after LFS 1 hit
  (at least according to that guy you love to hate, WCMaxi), but clearly not
  anymore.  But it still has its uses.


  Command:

  SSR, f+3, SSR
  SSL, f,N+4, SSL


  Uses:

  Of the two, the triple SSR is more useful.  Not only is it easier and 
  quicker to pull off than the triple SSL, you have more useful moves from
  the LFS.  I HAVE TO SAY, THOUGH, that Double Sidesteps (f+3, SSR) seem to
  work a lot better for avoiding attacks.  Dunno why.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


- f,f+4

  Yeah, this is just a regular move, but its properties are too good to 
  ignore.


  Command: f,f+4 (f,N,d,d/f, N, f+4)


  Uses:

  f,f+4 soars over floored opponents, and since you would normally end BT,
  you would now face forward after body crossing.  In my experience, I've 
  done this move after knocking down someone (buffered from a crouch dash).
  When he wanted to hit me with a KND 4, he stood up backwards, and I had 
  enough time for a back throw (though d+3,4, b+3 + combo would be better).
  The fact that it has zero tracking can be a good thing or a bad thing...


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Stutter Step

  I just made up a name for this RFF quirk, since it wasn't acknowledged in any
  FAQ I've seen.  I am sure it's been known since Tekken 3, though.


  Command:

  RFF f~b~f~b~f~b...


  Uses:

  If done correctly, you remain in RFF the whole time, sort of shifting back
  and forth.  IMO it's just as fun as Crazy Legs, and you look incredibly
  spazzed out.  In Tekken Tag, I would use this as a part of a RFF 4~f CH set
  up, but since that's harder in Tekken 4, you'll have to settle for RFF 4,4
  CH, delayed, since it won't combo otherwise.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Shuffle Step

  Kinda dumb, but I discovered this in Tekken 3 and Joshimitsu discovered it
  sometime later, claiming it as his own, which I don't mind, because I don't
  care too much about it.  I just made up a name for this move too, since I
  -know- it wasn't formally documented.


  Command:

  f+3+4,f+3+4,f+3+4,f+3+4
  b+3+4,b+3+4,b+3+4,b+3+4


  Uses:

  If done correctly, you switch stances and 'hop' forward quickly.  But it has
  to be done -so- quickly, you really have to know what you're doing.  That has
  to be bad for the opponent, too, so...


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: 4.2  Advanced Movement ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Crazy Legs

  Pioneered by Seok Dong-min in the TTT World Finals, it's actually a very
  simple concept: cancelling dash-buffered stance switches into sidesteps.
  The idea never occured to me that you'd go back into LFF as soon as you
  sidestep, and I never realized that dash-buffered stance switches (via
  b+3+4,b and f+3+4,f) get you into RFF quicker than the simple 3+4 stance
  switch.  


  Command:

  SSL, f+3+4,f, SSR, b+3+4,b [repeat]


  Uses:

  There's always the possibility of pulling out a RFF 3~4 on some of the less
  experienced players, especially those who don't know much about Hwoarang.
  Also, since you're in RFF half the time, you can sneak in a throw.  Since
  you're sidestepping the other half of the time, you can try a triple side-
  step to avoid attacks when your opponent thinks your vulnerable.  Above all,
  it's damn cool, and you will definitely use at least a little bit when
  disguising other attacks.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Snakedash

  This is a command made a LOT easier since Jung Gijae pulled it off faster
  than any lightdash in one old TTT Tekken Central vid.  It's simply crouch
  dashes followed by sidesteps up (and ONLY up, on EITHER side).


  Command:

  1P: f,N,d,d/f, N, SSL 
      f,N,d,d/f, N, f, N, SSR
  2P: f,N,d,d/f, N, SSR
      f,N,d,d/f, N, f, N, SSL


  Uses:

  It's always great for faking out an opponent, since you can choose to do the
  crouch dash longer than the sidestep for a psuedo-waveddash.

  Before the round starts, it's always a good idea to snakedash into b+2 (your
  opponent, if not knocked down on CH, will show his side or back, the latter
  giving a free BT LFF 4 launcher).  You can also snakedash one way, and when
  you can attack, triple sidestep the other way for some added confusion.


- Fox Step

  Well, I -did- write a whole damn FAQ for this, and deftones14 wrote a great
  supplement, so just read on.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: 4.3  More Stuff by deftones14 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[D14] This FAQ  is not for everyone.  There was a point  in my game  where 
movement seemed obsolete and a Fox Step was some stupid shit that Triple Lei 
did. It was not until I started using Hwoarang's strings/pokes effectively 
when I realized that my game was stuck on one level. My Hwoarang was the same
as everyone else’s. Nothing I did stood out. Hwoarang seemed as boring and 
close-minded as Jin.

That is when I decided to learn the Fox Step and try to use it effectively, 
not just for flash. Other kinds of movement began to evolve into my gameplay.
I saw the options for Hwoarang when  movement was involved and I saw a brand
new character to learn. 

Why  should you use movement?  IMO to  open  up the possibilities of  the 
character.


 - more space gives you a better opportunity to use his slower, but more 
   powerful moves.

 - you have more freedom to control the fight.

 - you are not stuck in your opponent's pressure tactics.

 - more space gives you a better opportunity to create more space ;)

 - you are using Hwoarang, a character with the ability to space himself, 
   unlike Kaz, Hei, King or even Jin.

 - to create flash and excitement in your gameplay, or you can just 1,2,1 over
   and over with Steve.


Imagine not using any form of movement. No side stepping, no back-dashing, no
dashing, no walking or running. Imagine just standing there and throwing out 
punches and kicks. That's a primitive fighting game. It's a boring and a very
unfair game, at least for Hwoarang. People that don't use movement are heading
in that direction in T4.

Although standard movement is used by many people, advanced movement is used 
by a few. In this section we will discuss the different options and the use of
standard and advanced movement altogether.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


SSR,f+3,SSR                        Triple SS


[D14] This move doesn’t work as well as it did in Tag, because the initial SS 
lost a lot of it’s priority. You can’t just throw this out and hope that you 
will SS anything your opponent will throw out. When timed properly however 
this works quite well. Since LFS now has d+3,4 and d+3,4, b+3 is guaranteed 
from the side (credit indirectly goes to Hwoarang77)or the back, the 3xSS 
gives you good ways to inflict damage. The 3xSS can be done if you are back 
turned. Even though the initial SS is very small the 2nd part should avoid 
linear moves when properly timed. Sometimes the opponent will not do very 
lagging attacks, so you might want to cut the last SS out and bust out the 
heel lance(LFS b+4).Sometimes you wont even SS to your opponents side, in that
case you should use your regular Flamingo tactics. It all depends on what move
you SS. This is good technique to learn and use.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


b+3+4~b                            RFF back-step

[D14] Quite possibly the fastest/most distance-covering and opportunity giving
back step in T4. If you keep holding B, you will end up in LFF, if not then 
RFF. This back step is best used with distance to bait your opponent to whiff
an attack. In other words this will make the opponent attacks have less range.
The key  to  using this effectively  is  to  know the opponent's  range and 
predicting  an attack and anticipating.  If you use this up-close you  are 
putting yourself in danger, because this is still a back-step and will only 
place you about 2 to 3 characters back.

You can SS either way after the back-dash and repeat the process as many times
as  you want for a useful  way to avoid an attack if the  opponent throws  a 
linear move out.  When you successfully executed this, you have a number of 
options at your disposal.


 1) RFF f+4~4 is probably the best choice. It covers ground, executes in 17 
    frames and also hits mid, just in case you don’t execute this fast enough 
    and your opponent blocks. When you do pull this move of you get a free 
    juggle of your choice.

 2) RFF 3~4 is for pure style. Since this move is slow and can be ducked, use 
    this only when your opponent whiffs a very lagging move. Paul’s Deathfist 
    is a good example.

 3) RFF 3 is only for times when your opponent executes attacks that recover 
    fast.  This only gives you 15 points of damage,  but it’s better to get 
    something than have punches flying your way.


You also have a good amount of things to do when the bait fails.


 1) You can continue doing the back-step into SS

 2) You can RFF flamingo SS(RFF f+4~N) into d/f+4. This is a surprise tactic 
    for 2 reasons:

    A: they were expecting RFF f+4~4, but instead saw a Flamingo feint, which
       gave them a reason to attack.

    B: they( and you ) underestimated the range of RFF f+4,d/f+4. Give it a 
       try and you will see how far this combination reaches.

 3) You can do a Fox Step to create more distance or just show off.

The Fox Step

[D14] The hardest advanced movement to use effectively IMO.

    NOTE: THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE FAQ I WILL BE REFFERING TO THE 
    1+2(bf3)U/F,4,f,f method of doing the FOX STEP unless otherwise noted) 

The wind-up time is slow compared to the actual step even if done very fast.
So why use this?


I  am not going to tell you how this  will save your Hwoarang from all  the 
jabbing/poking, because it will not. This is another baiting move that when 
used at a correct time and place will reward you as a Hwoarang player. After
getting a successful Fox Step you have a lot of options(as well as a lot of
props) to inflict good damage on your competition. If you can use this move
in a battle with positive effect, then you truly do have skill.

The more you like this method, the more you will want to use it. When this 
happens, you will try to use it at every opportunity and your opponent might
learn not to fall for the bait. When you blend this technique with everything
else that you have the opponent will fall for this a lot more often. 

The  basic philosophy behind the Fox Step  is baiting your opponent into  at 
attacking with a long reaching and also a very lagging move. When they see 
you switch into a backwards stance, they decide if they are close enough to 
attack. If they do decide to attack, by the time they throw out a move you 
should be dashing backwards and creating a whiff for them.

Why use this, when you have the b+3+4~b step? Even though they are the same 
kinds of movement(backward dashes) the back step doesn’t cover as much ground
and also doesn’t give the opponent a certain amount of time to think about 
their actions.  It is just a way to avoid moves. The Fox Step on the other 
hand gives the opponent a little amount of time to think and act. When you do
the F.S. you initiate the battle sequence, when you do the back-dash they 
initiate it.

Why is this so hard to use?  First,  you need distance,  without a certain 
amount of distance you will catch Deathfists while turned backwards. Second, 
the initial Stance switching might not be done fast enough( if you are worried
about getting hit and looking at your opponents actions too much) or you may 
mess up the motion. In other words once you initiate the motion you have to 
stick to the whole thing blindly, unless you sense danger right away in the 
case you can 3xSS.

Here is an example of good distancing while using the Fox Step. Sometimes you
can do a F.S. a little closer, it all depends on your situation.

You can control the distance of you Fox Step, but most of the time you are 
going to need it all. The better the bait, the riskier the situation, the 
better pay-off.


Here are your options from a successful Fox Step.

 1) 1+2(bf3),u/b,4,f,f~b~N+3 -

This is Hwoarang’s Plasma Blade, it is his BT version of LFF b+3. It is faster
than b+3, but doesn’t cover as much ground, also has less retaliation time 
against. This is probably the number one move to use after a successful F.S. 
The juggles you can do from this Plasma Blade are the same as his b+3 juggles.


 2) 1+2(bf3),u/b,4,f,f~uf~N~3 - (CREDIT GOES TO TRIPLE LEI)

This is another good option if you are further away from them. The good thing
about this kick is that it tracks really well and you have a medium and a low
version at your disposal. Both kicks have and extended range( a range that is
longer than you expected it to be) and the medium version stuns on a regular 
hit. Even though your opponent can escapes the stun it is extremely unlikely 
that they do so. The low version hits from 15 points of damage, but WS+4,4 is 
uninterruptible after it (even thought it doesn’t look like it). This move is
best used by the walls, because they can’t back-dash out of its range. They 
also have to guess either mid or low. Sometimes you can bait the opponent and
just do the uf~N hop, if they get smart and wait for you to whiff your kick if
they are out in the open.  You can block any retaliation attempts or do a 
rising attack (since you do recover crouching). NOTE: you can be jabbed out of
this move for a floating combo, if not used at the right time.


After you get the uf~N~3(M)to hit, you can do the following combos:

                                         
.------------------------------------._.------------------------------------.
| COMBO                              |_| NOTE                               |

| 3~4, 1,2,3, 4                      |_| you have to be in-close to land the|
|                                    |_| 1st 2 kicks. Most damaging         |
|------------------------------------|_|------------------------------------|
| f,f+3, d/b+4                       |_|most damaging for a guaranteed combo|

| f,f+4                              |_| Triple Lei’s combo, he usually uses|
|                                    |_| this by the wall.                  |

`------------------------------------' `------------------------------------'


 3) 1+2,SSR,f+3,SSR - 

This version of the 3xSS can be used when you know you are going to get hit 
out of your Fox Step attempt. The first SS is very small, but the 2nd one 
should be timed so that you avoid linear attacks. This is also good to do if
you want to add variations to your F.S. game, so they won’t get used to just
one tactic.


 4) 1+2(bf3),u/b,4,f,f,f,u/b,4,f,f,f - ( Credit goes directly to ILIKETEKKEN)

This is the fastest way to do continuos Fox Steps and also the best way to 
get rammed in the back. This is used simply for flash.

I’ll leave it up to Triple Lei to describe the different methods of doing the
Fox Step and tell you about even more opportunities to get it on someone.

Sometimes you can hit your opponent out of the air with a punch. This is what
I call a floater combo;)

Example of this is Kazuya’s TGF,3- we all know there is a brief moment when 
he can be hit. Usually I start with 1,2,3,1 and then continue from there.

Another example is when the opponent rolls back and you somehow picked him 
up with d/f+1+2. If you do a punch fast enough you can get a floater combo.

However these are rare and shouldn’t be thought of as part of the main combo
strategy.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


BT 3 - 

This is another version of b+3, the same combos apply plus 2 (WOOHOO) points
more damage.


BT RFF 4 - 

This is another version of RFF f+4~4, so guess what... the same combos apply
with (complete silence) NOT 1, BUT 2 more points of damage(YAAAAAYYYY).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Another interesting idea is to SS slightly after a launcher(except for d/f+2)
and begin your juggle with a punch string. You might get a side-wall stun if
you properly align yourself with a wall.


NOTE:TO DO THIS YOU NEED TO BE EXPERIENCED WITH WALLS AND DIFFERENT JUGGLING
POSSIBILTIES, SO ONLY ADVANCED PLAYERS WILL GET FULL BENEFIT OUT OF THIS 
TECHNIQUE.


[3XL] This is especially true after parrying a low kick and following with
b+3.  The best (well, only) thing would be something like 1,2,3, 1, f,f, 1,2.
Then just hope you find a wall, somewhere.  I thought of this after seeing
Raijin's 150% damage wall stun combo.

:: 5.3  Wall Stun Combos :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMAND                 DAMAGE     NOTES

LFF 3~4, 3+4, 3~4       87         This one is not that hard to get. All they
                                   have to do is guess wrong by the wall.


RFF 3~4, 3+4, 3~4       101        This one is very hard to get. You have to
                                   be a really good baiter with RFF 3~4. 
                                   Sometimes if you are by the corner you 
                                   can add even more damage, but those 
                                   opportunities are rare.


2,f+4 CH, f,f+3         75         This is  somewhat hard to get, because 
                                   you have to aligned on a 90 degree angle 
                                   with the wall. If you are off , even by a 
                                   little bit, the Wall Stun will not happen.


RFF f,f+3, b+3          53         This is hard to get, simply because f,f+3 
                                   is not that fast of a move to catch someone
                                   chillin by the wall with.


RFF f,f+4,3, 4          57         Same here, pretty hard to get.


u+3, f+3                46         If you actually use this move, then it is
                                   not hard to get.


LFS 4, 3                57         Somewhat easy to get, if they keep SS by 
                                   the wall.


RFS 3, 4                56         Somewhat easy to get, if they keep SS by
                                   the wall.


4,4,4,4, 3~4            103        A lot of times they will block your 1st 3
                                   hits and then they have to guess wrong at
                                   the mix-up between 4,4,4,4 and 4,4,4,3. If
                                   they guess low, they will loose about 40%
                                   of their life.

:: 6.1  Basic Idea / Philosophies ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[D14] Flamingo Stances introduce a whole new level of playing a character. 
Besides a couple of others in the Tekken World, no one else has the potential
to reach the deadly attack flow and evasiveness as Hwoarang does. While at 
first Flamingo game might be confusing to you, eventually you will find what 
works, what doesn’t and what leads to what. After a while Flamingo will be a 
natural thing that will strengthen your level of playing.

Flamingo stances are Hwoarang’s “better” stances, as some could say. You have 
all kinds of useful moves at your disposal in two nifty packages(LFS,RFS). 
You have the fastest kicks in the game(PBK (LFS f+3/RFS f+4) which also match
the fastest jabs in the game),you have the best(not the fastest) punches in 
the game, and an enormous amount of frame advantage, even on block.

Which stance is better? Well they are both useful, just for different things.
In LFS you have more mix-up options, because of the new version of d+3,4. In
RFS you have frame advantage options. The jabs from RFS put you in RFF where 
you have RFF 2, which is another jab that gives you +4 on block. The new 
addition  to  Hwoarang is FL. stance switching(3+4) that can confuse your 
opponent as well as give you greater mix-up options.

Even though your attacks are around 13 to 17 frames, the amount of frames you
get when you enter flamingo makes it possible to use those attacks without 
the fear of interruption. Even when you have your attack blocked certain moves
can take over jabs.


Example:

PBK on block give you –3 disadvantage , so naturally jabs(high 8 frame) can 
interrupt your next set of PBK. However a heel lance from that stance will 
take over the jabs 80% of the time(credit goes to Bazzoie). After a while 
your opponent learns not to attack with jabs, so will either back-step or do 
a low jab. In case of a low jab you should pause your attack, since the 
distance a blocked PBK gives you makes all low jab attempts whiff. In case of
a back step you can continue with your Flamingo offense.  Some characters 
(Julia) has very fast moves that take over the heel lance, namely f,f+1. In 
that case I am pretty sure a quick backstep from flamingo into another set of
PBK will interrupt that. The interesting thing about the Blocked PBK>b~f+3/4
(depending on your stance) is that it can interrupt jabs as well. So you have
two reliable options from blocked PBK to continue your Flamingo Flow. Also 
don’t forget that you can SS attacks up-close. In order to SS jabs you have 
to FL.SS to your right.

There are many reasons why people use Flamingo. Some like continuing stringing
to frustrate opponents(ILIKTEKKEN;) and have a nice flow to their Fl. Game. 
Others like me like to get in Flamingo either launch or trip their opponent 
and get back into regular stances.

The fundamental reasoning behind the STRINGING FLAMINGO GAME is to apply 
pressure by using attacks that give you frame advantage, mostly Flamingo Jabs.
Since the jabs hit high the opponent is going to be anticipating them and 
ducking, that is when all other attacks start to have their time and place. 
After they guess wrong you can enter Flamingo again and repeat the process.

 
 Flamingo strings>  Flamingo cancel>  Flamingo entrance>   repeat...


Of course for this to work the opponent has to guess wrong at certain points
of the strings. I really don’t use too much of this, so I can’t give you a 
detailed description.

The fundamental reasoning behind the MOVE FLAMINGO GAME is using moves that 
either trip, launch, or hit, without the long strings. NO bullshit, just do 
what you go to do and get out (of the flamingo stances). I will compare the
T4 MISHIMA crouchdash game to Flamingo.


PBK is WGF 
 - Both are interruptors, extremely fast but hit HIGH.

HEEL LANCE is TGF 
 - Both are slow, but give you a lot of damage opportunity if they hit and are
   both MID.

d+3,4 (LFS ONLY) is the sweep kick 
 - Hits LOW and gives you frame advantage.

TEASE TRIP is the delayed sweep-kick 
 - Think of this as a delayed sweep kick for those that use the d/f~N method 
   to stop mix-ups.


When you get into flamingo from 1,2 on block you have these options:

1) Do a quick set of PBK to interrupt anything coming your way.
2) Do a Heel lance if they will duck.
3) Do a d+3,4 if they block standing.
4) Do a Teaser tip if they use the d/f~N method to disable the mix-up between
   a heel lance and d+3,4.

So, as you can see you have the right move for any situation. In case that 
they try to SS you Fl. game use PBK and jumping spinning-hook kicks (LFS 4 /
RFS 3)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: 6.2  Flamingo Flow ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is something that comes with experience and luck. This simply means that
you know what moves to use and you predicting your opponent defensive tactics
and countering with your own. This is important due to the psychological 
damage that you will make your opponent encounter. When you break down their 
mental defense with a sharp flow they may freeze and just stand blocking. At
this point you have won the match on a mental level.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: 6.3  True Flamingo Cancels ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am not going to say that I have discovered this. But I think I can say that
I was the first to bring this up on the boards on TZ.

If you press 1,2,3,N you can see that Hwoarang will do 1-2 punch follow by a 
chamber. A chamber is when Hwoarang brings his knee up to his body. If you 
leave the control in Neutral you will see Hwoarang dropping his leg. At this 
point you can enter any LFF command. If you press 1,2,4,N you can enter any 
RFF command. What does this mean? It means you can buffer moves and have them
unleashed before Hwoarang’s foot drops. This sounds pretty good on paper, but
it takes about 15 frames for his foot to drop. In other words try this only 
if the initial Flamingo Entrance connects, because the opponent has less time
to react and he is more likely to just block. You can use this in Okizeme, by
tricking your opponent into foolishly getting up or by the wall where the 
pressure is on.

This shouldn’t be used too often, because the opponent can catch on very fast,
but as an alternative mix-up this can have a use or two. Only certain versions
of Flamingo entrances can be used for this.

1,2,3  1,2,4  2,3  2,4  LFF f+3  RFF f+4

NOTE: EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE KNEW OF INPUTING F AFTER HIS FOOT DROPPED TO GET F,F
MOVES, I HAVEN’T HEARD OF THE IDEA OF BUFFERING ANY MOVE AFTER HIS FOOT DROPS,
SO I WILL GIVE MYSELF CREDIT FOR REALIZING IT. ALSO NO ONE HAS SAID ANYTHING 
TO ME AT TZ BOARDS.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: 6.4  Flamingo Cancels :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any move that get you out of Flamingo are  Flamingo Cancels. RFS 2, RFS d/f+4,
LFS 1  are the  moves  that he has that give you  frame advantage when  you 
Flamingo Cancel. There are other moves that can be used (LFS 2, RFS 1, LFS 
d/f+4) but if you get them blocked your cancel becomes worthless.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: 6.5  The Idea of Strings ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea behind using strings is to give yourself frame advantage to create a
mix-up that either way punishes your opponent. Since Hwoarang is blessed with
moves out Flamingo that give him frame advantage even on block this game 
becomes more Hwoarang-friendly.


RULE #1

After d+3,4 hits you can switch stances(3+4) and still have an uninterruptable
string.  Use f+3(PBK) after the switch to interrupt any jab attempt and 
continue your flow. In case that they do not interrupt you can d+3,4(L) again,
Teaser-trip(l) them or heel lance them(M). This is probably the most used 
Flamingo offensive.


RULE #2

After PBK hits your heel lance in uninterruptable. So if you are in LFS you 
can d+3,4 (this is interruptable, from my experience), or heel lance them. 
Thus, a pretty effective mix-up is created.


RULE #3

After a blocked RFS 2 or LFS 1, you jabs are uninterruptable.


RULE #4

After RFS d/f+4 you get +2, your jabs are uninterruptable due to distance.


RULE #5

You don’t have to finish the switch-stance(3+4) animation in order to start 
putting in other commands.


RULE #7

d+3,4 (both versions) have two points of command input. The first point is 
right before Hwoarang goes into a chamber. The second is after the chamber is
entered. If you do d+3,4,b+3 and it registers as a 3 hit combo(even though it
is not) than you are entering the command at the first point. The first point
gives you more frame advantage.


RULE #8 

d+3,4,b+3 is guaranteed from the side and the back when done at their fastest
(see rule #7 for more details)


RULE #9 

1,2,3,b+4, 1,2,4,b+3 are guaranteed from the back when done at their fastest
(see rule #7 for more details)


With these in mind you should have an idea what to do while you are in 
Flamingo. The key to strings is knowing your opponent and being good at 
reading their mind. Make sure to vary speeds between strings(ONLY IF YOUR 
OPPONENT USES A LOT OF REVERSALS), so they will get confused even more. 
Certain opponents have parries and reversals. While fighting those people 
try to predict(or know if you have played them for a while) at which point 
they will reverse/parry you and either change the height of the attack or 
delay it.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: 6.6  Juggles of Flamingo ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flamingo offers a new twist on juggles in Tekken 4. As you know there are 
walls and if the opponent is facing towards a wall he has to press B to tech-
roll instead of 1,2,3,or 4. If they are side turned than the opponent can’t 
tech-roll. The two main Flamingo juggle starters are his heel lances. They 
both launch your opponent so that they flip in the air. If you follow-up the
heel lance with punches or d/b+4,4 notice that they are now facing the wall. 
What does this mean? It means you can do a variety of things to drain a half
of their life. The key to these juggles is the right distance to be at while 
you launch your opponent.


Here are examples of Juggles out of Flamingo by the wall:

f+3,b+4 

 - The opponent is now flipping, while you are in RFF-2,3-they are now facing
   the wall while you are in LFF-3,3,3,3-is un-techable by the wall-about 80 
   points of damage gone.


Another example is not a juggle but rather a set-up(credit goes indirectly to
Smaksu)

f+3,b+4

 - The opponent is flipping,while you are in RFF-2,3-they are now facing the 
   wall while you are in LFF,but you are too far away to hit them-d/b+3+4
   (Hwoarang’s unblockable)-this will give you good damage while they are
   laying/teching/trying to get away.


When you are right on top of the wall and launch with either heel lance you 
can do the Unblockable (d/b+3+4) and if they tech-roll (a lot of people will)
they will get caught in the set-up.


Here is a list of the juggles of the heel lances by the wall:

.------------------------------------._.------------------------------------.
| COMBO                              |_| NOTE                               |
|------------------------------------|_|------------------------------------|
| HEEL LANCE, d/b+4,4, 3,3,3,3       |_| This one needs correct distance.   |
|------------------------------------|_|------------------------------------|
| LFS HEEL LANCE, f+3, f+3           |_| You need to be on top of the wall  |
|                                    |_| to do this.                        |
|------------------------------------|_|------------------------------------|
| LFS HEEL LANCE, 4,4                |_| You need to be on top of the wall  |
|                                    |_| to do this.                        |
|------------------------------------|_|------------------------------------|
| RFS HEEL LANCE, 1,2,3, 3,3,3       |_| Needs timing and rhythm(experience |
|                                    |_| needed)                            |
|------------------------------------|_|------------------------------------|
| RFS HEEL LANCE, 1,2,3, f+3         |_| Needs exact spacing(experience is  |
|                                    |_| needed)                            |
`------------------------------------' `------------------------------------'

There are plenty of options from heel lances, as always try to experiment with
your own ideas to understand the wall game better.


Hwoarang also has d/f+4 out of RFS which will juggle on a regular and counter 
hits.


Some of the juggles from a regular hit:

RFS d/f+4, d+3,4, 3

RFS d/f+4, d/b+4,4

RFS d/f+4, IWS+4,4

RFS d/f+4, d/f+1+2, d/b+4,4

RFS d/f+4, d+4,4


Some of the juggles on counter hit:

RFS d/f+4, 1,2,3, 4

RFS d/f+4, 1,2,3, 1, f,f+4


Also any juggle that applies to the regular hit version.

stand right up for a free BT 4 juggle.

For things you should already know, go to www.tekkenzaibatsu.com and click on
the Legend link.  As for the terms exclusive to this FAQ:


cd -

Short for "crouch dash;" f,N,d,d/f.  Used by many for those non-Mishima moves,
though this isn't officially recognized by Zaibatsu, which is why the term is
still absent from the Legend.  Of course, it's used in VF too, and that's good
enough for me.


oki -

Short for "okizeme," the art of keeping your opponent floored.  Again, it's
used in VF.


Yomi Level X -

I sorta picked this up from sirlin.net.  Yomi translates to "mind reading."
And yup, it's a common term in VF.

[3XL] Playing Hwoarang is good for the soul.  If you don't fall into the trap
of LFS d+3,4,  Hwoarang is a very rewarding character.  And honestly, good
Hwoarang players ALWAYS get more props than good Jin players.  There are tons
of ways to play him, which means new ideas are always coming in.


[D14] IMO in order to use Hwoarang effectively you need to use everything he 
has. Pokes, movement, juggles, set-ups, strings all need to be used. When you 
find the balance while using all of the things I mentioned above, you will 
understand Hwoarang better and become a better player.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


[3XL] I've written some other FAQs, some of which are exclusive to Zaibatsu
and some are still on GameFAQs, though horribly outdated by now.  I'd like
to take the time to PROMOTE VF4 and VF4 Evolution, and to... sorta discourage
SC2.  Anyone who's anyone in the SC community knows that Cassandra's cheesy
infinite (which is actually NOT banned by WCMaxi, that bastard!) makes the
game broken beyond belief, far worse than Jin in any Tekken... and weapons!?
VF4 on the other hand is also good for the soul, what with no weapons, an
extremely solid throw and wall system, and even customizable characters (as
far as appearances go anyway).  I absolutely hated VF3 (and I can happily
tell you how much I hated it), but VF4 is so much better than VF3, visually
and otherwise.  I know the Tekken 4 players are splitting into two factions
(VF camp, SC camp), but with tomhilfiger exclusively playing VF4, why should
you play anything else?


[D14] This will be my last project(also my first) that has to do with Tekken4.
I, like a lot of other people have moved on to Soul Calibur. Personally I have
never liked it, and always preferred Tekken over it, but now my opinion has 
changed. I found a very rich, deep and fun experience that Tekken doesn’t 
offer anymore. I also suggest that anyone who is very tired of Tekken and in 
search of something new and just as good (IMO it’s wayyyy better though) to 
try to learn SC.

    Your #1 Tekken resource on the net!  Great selection of movies and the
    most popular Tekken forum.  As Tekken.Net, it started my fascination with
    BT attacks and strings with the Tekken Dance Video (not up anymore).


- http://www.electriccancel.com

    Fantastic tournament footage, nice layout, and a really popular forum
    with the cutest smilies... aw... :)  KOFTEKKEN, the one who showed the
    U.S. how to Fox Step, posts there (especially after tourneys).


- http://www.tekkencentral.com

    THIS. IS. HOW. YOU. PLAY. TEKKEN.  Although the site is now fully Korean,
    the match and combo movies will keep you coming back for more.


  Welp, those are the big 3.  There are tons of other great sites, but they
  probably aren't -too- Fox Step related. :P  Here are those:


- http://tekken.underactive.net (my site)
    
    I considered this site one of my main hobbies (and I need a new one...) - 
    I felt I had to share, though pics and descriptions, the classic / ground-
    breaking movies in the history of the post-Slikatel Tekken community.  It
    is extremely hard work putting up site and movie descriptions, taking pics
    of movies and then writing about them some more, so the site is on hiatus
    right now.  


- http://www.cdycus.com/~sdtekken

    SD TeKKeN, hosted by my bud CodEZ.  Info about the fastest growing Tekken
    community and much more!


- http://www.clubrichandcreamy.com/sdtekken

    The movie page for SD TeKKeN, and where my movies have been hosted.  A
    super duper ultra extreme alpha omega BIG ASS THANKS to PoiNtKiSMeT!
    ...although my "btomgwtflol.avi" vid is nowhere to be seen... hmm...


- http://www.arcadepimp.com

    Besides being a supremely high quality site, this site has Shukudai's
    Steve combo videos.  Act. 2 has a little Tekken Dance, yay!


- http://www.tekkenmania.com

    Formerly JustFrame.com!


- http://ina.tekken.org

    A Japanese movie post page.  It shouldn't be hard at all to navigate to
    find Hwoarang match movies, which are the most popular!

[3XL] I'd like to thank deftones14 for working with me on this project.  If
not for him, this FAQ would be nothing but a glorified movelist that would
have probably been only half done.  He caught everything I missed and added
loads of stuff, and he also confirmed quite a few things as well.  Although
the formatting was a NIGHTMARE (long story short, you can see the horribly
formatted FAQ at http://www.geocities.com/triple_lei/LQv.1.doc and see the
cardinal sins of FAQ writting being committed, such as, but not limited to,
using the 'TAB' key, having large and bold fonts, and inconsistencies all
over the place)... I wouldn't have it any other way.  It was fun! (eventually)

As far as "who did what," I came up with the section ideas (except for the   
"6.  Flamingo" section), formatting, data columns, and half of the move
analysis.  deftones14 did a very, VERY sizable amount, writing the other half
of the move analysis, the entire Flamingo section, and actually writing the
content for most of my ideas.  But I did the formatting!

Thanks to WeaponX for being my sparring partner, White Rob for being nice,
tensaikun for being mean (he gave me this real mean look at SHGL), bazooie
for being a dick, and SMAKSU for being the voice of reason most of the time,
outside of calling Hwoarang some other three-letter palindrome name like it
was cool.  (it's not, btw.)  The senior posters at the now shamefully long 
strat thread deserve honorable mentions to: Holden, HoustonHardHitt, D4M, 
tbuxton, hwoarang77, Joshimitsu, and some others I forgot.  ***IF YOU WANT 
YOUR NAME LISTED HERE FOR SOME REASON, HOPE THAT I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT TEKKEN
AND THIS FAQ AT THAT TIME AND I'LL PROBABLY ADD YOU.***
