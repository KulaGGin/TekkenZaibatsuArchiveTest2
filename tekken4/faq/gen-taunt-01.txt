I: Introduction
***********************
     If you're reading this you're probably a big fan of Tekken. I created this 
FAQ, or rather list, for those who like to be stylish as well as functional in 
their Tekken 4 bouts. Sure those infinite juggles, various strategies, and JF 
moves are part of that but that's not what I'm covering, especially since it's 
already been done(and much better than I could have done). Most people I play 
would rather not waste their time watching the character introductions, 
replays, or even care about the character costumes. But for those who do, the 
taunts and replays are the extra icing on the cake of victory(There's nothing I 
enjoy better than trashing an opponent with Lei and making them listen to "You 
are not good enough," in his silly accent or having Heihachi slam their face 
into ground after telling to come back when they're a better fighter.).

     The list corresponds to those taunts and costumes found in the PS2 version.
The arcade is pretty similar for the most part with a few exceptions like the 
Eddy palette swap for Christie when she's chosen with a RP, and maybe a few 
taunts were changed when NAMCO decided it'd be good if Hwoarang actually spoke 
Korean and Steve sounded like he was actually British. The button listings are 
the standard Tekken nomenclature( 1 = LP, 2 = RP, 3 = LK, 4 = RK, _ = OR, etc.)
but note that any change in the 4 buttons configuration(e.g. setting the "O" 
button on the PS2 to LP for example) will NOT change the costume select(e.g. if 
"O" was set to LP pressing it to select Heihachi will still get you his Black 
Gi instead of the diaper). I noticed this after getting a X-Arcade stick with 
PS2 adapter that stupidly rotates the 4 major buttons that corresponds to 
"Square","Triangle","X","O". With all that said lets begin...




II: Character Costumes
***********************
     The general rule for the costumes(with the exception of Brian and Jin) is 
that selecting with the punches will get you whatever the character is wearing 
in the CG rendered portrait and the right attacks will usually get you the PS2 
alternate character palette swaps(i.e. 4 = Miharu, 2 = Eddy, 2_4= Violet).

III: Character Taunts
***********************
     I'm not sure when exactly is it that inputting the button will make sure 
your character will do the taunt. The way I do it is I just hold down the 
button for the duration of the replay. Keep in mind if you hit the start button 
during the replay I think you may get the taunt corresponding to last button 
pressed or it might be random. There hasn't been any consistency with all the 
characters though there are some where it seems to work(e.g. Heihachi and Lee). 
There also seems to be some taunts that only happen with a combination of 
buttons. Or at least Jin has one(3+4). Maybe there are others but I haven't 
found any with the characters I've tried. 

     There are certainly some taunts that seem to only happen from pressing 
start to skip the replay. I want to say it's random when you get these taunts 
but there are some characters where that doesn't seem the case. I've tried many 
things to get these specific taunts to show up all the time, but the best I can 
do is get them to show up a "majority" of the time. I can't say these methods 
are definite but in my experience this has been the case. Here are some 
theories on what the "random" taunts are produced by. They're ranked (from most 
to least) by how relevant I think they might be to finding a definite way to 
get the desired taunt:


Directional Inputs: This was suggested by Alejandro to me in an email and it 
seems to have been the most helpful in getting random taunts to show up. It 
appears if you hold one of the directions while pressing start that a random 
taunt will show up. This seems to be in the case while playing as Heihachi for 
me. For example: holding B while hitting start has yielded many times Hei's one 
random taunt(more than the 20% that's for sure). This also seems to make sense 
given the fact that Lei and Law have both 4 random taunts which might 
correspond to the directional inputs.

Finishing move: I've finished many a match with Lee using a 3+4 move 
(e.g. u/f+3+4 or f,f, N+3+4) then pressed start and gotten ones of his random 
taunts.

Timing of pressing start:  I've noticed sometimes pressing start immediately 
yields more non-random taunts than the regular ones.

Pressing start when the character isn't attacking in the replay: Some how I 
think this relates to the previous theory about timing.

Health you finish with:   I noticed that on a string of perfects I would get 
the same random taunt when I pressed start.
 


     That's all the theories so far. I have yet to produce any results that are 
totally 100%. When/if I find a way to get the random taunts all the time I'll 
revise the FAQ. Until then it will remain a mystery. 

     Before I get to the the taunts I had a few last points of interest. The 
first is regarding the translations of those non-English characters. They 
aren't the exact literal translations. They've been rephrased in English to 
more accurately express, in English, the feeling of the taunt. With that in 
mind, don't take my FAQ as a definitive translation source. Lastly, if the 
character is from a previous Tekken most likely their random taunts are ones 
they had in a previous Tekken game. I've listed those random ones under "?"

IV: Closing
***********************

    I've played T4 at least hundreds and hundreds of hours since it hit the PS2 
so I think I've seen most of 'em all. If anyone has some more taunts found, or 
discovered what determines what taunt will get played when start is pressed 
during the replay I would gladly appreciate this info. Also, if you have any 
other questions, comments, etc. feel free to email 
mitaphane@stevesbackyardboxing.org. Props to NAMCO for making such a great 
fighting series, and the whole Tekken community in general.
