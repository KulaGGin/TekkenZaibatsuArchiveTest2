INTRODUCTION:

----------------------
WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 2.5:

V2.5 - 9.Feb.2003 - Tweaked movelist.  Added section on fighting Jin 
and 8-frames vs. 10-frames.  Added Wall games, Crouch Games, and 
Okizeme.
V2.0 - 23.July.2002 - This thing was so out of date that it was 
embarrassing me.  I changed a whack of stuff.
v1.2 - 28.May.2002 - Added Opponents Section and made a few more tweaks.
v1.1 - 25.May.2002 - I've tweaked little things here and there: I 
caught a few errors, and I've since tested some of the throws I was 
unfamiliar with. As well, I've added some beginning juggle pointers 
in Section I.
v1.0 - 13.May.2002 - Creation of this FAQ.

----------------------
ABOUT THIS FAQ:

This guide has been created with new Julia players in mind: this FAQ 
should contain everything you need to get a sturdy knowledge of her 
basics. Since I created this FAQ, Tekken Zaibatsu has created a Combo 
section where juggle lists for Julia can be found. I highly encourage 
you to check out this section once you are comfortable with Julia's 
basics: my Julia game has increased twofold since I began testing out 
some of these juggles! I will not bother to list any big juggles in 
this FAQ, so if that is what you are looking for, check out TZ.

If you are new to Tekken altogether, Julia is a great player to begin 
with. She is strong and quick (with a blistering 8-frame jab), and is 
adaptable for offensive or defensive players. Her moves are pretty 
straight-forward, making her quicker to learn than more complex 
players such as Lei or Hwoarang.

For disadvantages, though, Julia is very easy to avoid by 
sidewalking, as her moves are quite linear.  As well, a lot of moves 
leave her with an enormous disadvantage; a Julia player must be very 
adaptable and have a precise sense of timing.

Before you begin this guide, please make sure you are familiar with 
the basics of Tekken 4; sidestepping, sidewalking and the wall 
systems. There are plenty of FAQ's out there to get you started (try 
www.tekkenzaibatsu.com), and most people at your local arcade will be 
happy to give you advice if you ask.

I am still learning myself, so if anything here is inaccurate, please 
email kuni@kuni-bob.com, and I will rectify this FAQ as soon as 
possible.



SECTION I: JULIA'S MOVES

-------------------------

>>I) A: BASICS<<

This section is for people completely new to the Tekken system. If 
you have read any Tekken FAQ's before, chances are that you are 
familiar with the system for describing moves. Just in case:

1 = left punch (square on PS gamepad)
2 = right punch (triangle)
3 = left kick (x)
4 = right kick (o)
u = up (capitalized = hold)
d = down (capitalized = hold)
f = forward (capitalized = hold)
b = back (capitalized = hold)
qcf = quarter circle forward (d,d/f,f)
qcb = quarter circle back (d,d/b,b)
N = leave joystick/pad in neutral position
SS(R/L) = sidestep (right/left)
SW(R/L)=sidewalk (right/left)
FC = full crouch (D/B)
WS = while standing (from a crouch to a standing position)
WR = while running
~ = input the next button very quickly  (eg: f+1~2, the 2 is input 
very quickly after the 1)
h = high
m = mid
M = mid; hits grounded
Sm = special mid (can be blocked high or low)
L = low; hits grounded
l  = low; doesn't hit grounded
CH = counter hit (ie: your move interrupts the opponent's)
BT = back turned (your back faces the opponent)

Thus, d/f+1 would mean move the joystick to the diagonal position 
between down and forward, and press 1. Commas separate different 
movements; d/f+1, 2 would mean input d/f+1, then press 2.

Like most fighting games, Tekken uses a sliding motion for 
directional inputs.  Thus, d,d/f means press "d" and quickly slide to 
the "d/f" position without returning to neutral.

Other things you will want to become familiar with as you improve:
   -dashing vs. walking, back dash, crouch dash
   -tech rolls
   -throw escapes
   -blocking/defending/parries/reversals
   -tackles
   -high, mid and low hits
   -counter vs. normal hits

As well, I refer frequently to "frame data"...the amount of time a 
move takes to execute is measured in frames (with 60 frames per 
second). You'll quickly get the hang of how long 8 frames is as 
opposed to 12 frames; it just takes a bit of practice.  Check out TZ 
for more information.

Enough basics...onto the real thing!

----------------------------

>>I) B: SPECIAL<<

The moves are listed as follows:
button combination - move name - where move hits (h, m, L) - damage 
on a normal hit

If a move can be followed by another move, the second move is listed 
as "=" and then the move. A note that people refer to moves in 
different ways; trust the button input more than the move name!

*df+2 - Slow Power Punch - m - 10
  =Skyscraper Cannon - 1 - m - 21 - launcher
  =Low kick - 3 - L - 10
  =High Kick - 4 - h - 20
The Slow Power Punch is, as its name suggests, slow. I rarely use the 
Low/High Kick combos, as the Machine Gun Punch high/low combos are 
quicker -- however, d/f+2,4 does leave Julia safe if it is blocked. 
The Skyscraper Cannon is guaranteed after a low parry, so parry often 
and you'll get a free juggles.
   Another good time to use the d/f+2,1 is in okizeme (please see the 
okizeme section for details).

*f+1 - Flash Uppercut - m - 15 - launcher
Although it's a bit slow, the Flash Uppercut always juggles if it 
connects.  As it will go under many high moves, it makes a great 
"surprise" launcher.  Still, because of its slowness, use with 
caution - if it's blocked, Julia will be vulnerable.

*d,d/f+1 or WR+1 - Rapid Counter - m - 14
  = 2 - Flash Elbow - m - 21
The Rapid Counter is fast and does good damage; it can be used in 
juggles both on its own or with the Flash Elbow, depending on the 
setup. The WR version is great to use as a follow-up if a downed 
opponent is slow to rise -- you can time it to catch them just as 
they are standing, so they will be unable to block. However, the 
complete combo can sometimes lead Julia off-axis, leaving her 
vulnerable to side throws from an opponent. The complete Rapid 
Counter combo is often used to finish juggles, so make sure you
master the d,d/f version.
     As a note, the 2 can be delayed, and it stuns on a CH - leaving 
your opponent open to launchers such as d/f+2,1.  Try following the 
d,d/f+1 with a mixup of her Mad Axes or the 2 finisher.  If the 
opponent blocks in anticipation of the 2, her Mad Axes will catch 
him.  If the opponent tries to attack, expecting a MadAxes, the 2 can 
land as a CH.  Or, if he ducks and low jabs, you can parry after the 
d,d/f+1 and land a launcher.

*WR+2 or FC, d/f+2 - Flash Elbow - m - 20
Julia is notorious for her elbows, and with good reason. The Flash 
Elbow it fast, hits mid and knocks your opponent back.  On a CH, any 
of her standard juggles or throws can be used (so long as your 
opponent doesn't break the stun).  ...If blocked, however, Julia is 
vulnerable for 20 frames, so be cautious if your opponent is in a 
position to retaliate.

*1~2 - Machine Gun Punch - h, m - 10, 8
  = 1 - Skyscraper Cannon (only on a CH) - m - 21 - launcher
  = 3 - Low Kick - L - 10
  = 4 - High Kick - h - 20 - launcher(on a CH)
The Machine Gun Punch is simple, yet very effective. If the opening 
jab is a CH, then you can follow with a Skyscraper Cannon, which 
deals lots of damage and allows juggles. The High Kick and Low Kick 
can be thrown in randomly to keep the opponent guessing. It can also 
be used as a Mad Axes buffer (see Mad Axes buffers section).
   The 1,2,1 is great to use against opponents who like to start each 
round with a slow, heavy-hitting move. The leading jab is incredibly 
fast -- 8 frames! -- so it will knock your opponent out of their move 
and launch them with the Skyscraper Cannon.

*ff+1 - Party Crasher - m - 10
  = 4 - Skyscraper Kick - m - 15
This is arguably Julia's best move. The elbow launches your opponent 
backwards. It can't be parried by most opponents.  It's fast, with 11 
frames to hit and 2 to recover.  It can catch tech-rolling opponents, 
duck under some high moves, takes great priority as you dash at an 
opponent, and is great as a juggle filler.
     An old mixup that still works well is mixing between ff+1,4 and 
ff+1~Mad Axes (or any other quick throw).  If you perform the string 
often enough, you can train your opponent to block after the elbow in 
anticipation of the 4 -- and you might just catch them by surprise 
with the throw instead. ^_~  The 4 can be delayed, too, to catch your 
opponent off guard.
     After a blocked elbow, Julia is at -2 frames, so she is very 
safe.  Take note of what your opponent does after they block an 
elbow.  If they like to low jab (d/b+1 or FC+1), you can perform a 
low parry (hold d/f) to get a free d/f+2,1.  If they throw out a 
normal standing jab, you can either block and work from there, or, if 
it's a slower character, interrupt with 1,2,1 or 1,1,1 for a counter 
hit to juggle.  Sometimes, a well-timed f+1+2 will duck under a jab 
(even of the fast characters) and counter-hit.  If they like to keep 
blocking, you can use a throw such as Mad Axes or d,D/B+1+3.
     Of special note to newbies: the Party Crasher can be performed 
differently, and each option has different recovery properties.  The 
f,F+1 has good range, but recovers slowly.  The elbow you will want 
to use in juggles is more like f,f~N~1.  If you set the CPU on 
practice mode and test different execution speeds, you'll get the 
hang of it.

*f+1~2 - Palm Explosion - m - 21
The Palm explosion is slow and easy to see coming. However, it ducks 
under grabs and high moves, nailing Julia's opponent in the gut, and 
leaving them stunned long enough for follow-ups (on a CH, though the 
stun is escapable). So, if you're looking for something to disrupt a 
throw-happy player's momentum, you may want to time this in.  Good 
follow-ups are a 3,2,2, a d+4,1 or her standard elbow juggles.
     As well, the Palm Explosion catches tech-rolling opponents.  As 
your opponent rolls back and rises, there is a period of time where 
he/she is unable to block.  This is the perfect time for a Palm 
Explosion (though d/f+2,1 yields more damage).

*f,f+2 - Lashing Arrow - h - 25
One of Michelle's TTT moves. It's flashy, but the guard stun on this 
is horrendous -- 19 frames, much worse than the Palm Explosion. I 
would recommend using this *only* if you're looking to close a large 
gap between you and an attacking opponent, as the move will cover a 
lot of distance. Still, the opponent can easily duck under it and 
retaliate. Use with caution!

*f+1+2 - Shove It Up - m - 28 - launcher(CH)
A wonderful against-the-wall move; it slaps a falling opponent back 
into a standing position against the wall -- the perfect position for 
a beating. On a CH or from the side, Shove It Up juggles. As an added 
bonus, the Julia's recovery on a block is only 3 frames, so there is 
only a small chance for retaliation. The only real downfall is that 
the move takes 19 frames to hit and it's easy to anticipate. 
However, it goes underneath many high pokes (such as Nina's 1,2 or 
Steve's 1,2,1).

*1~1 - G-Clef Cannon - h, m - 10, 5
  = 1 - Flash Uppercut - m - 21 - launcher
  = 2 - Palm Explosion - m - 21
  = 4 - Bow Leg - L - 12
     = 3 - Arrow - m - 15
I will start by saying do not use the 1,1,1 string unless the first 
hit is a CH. All three moves hit mid, so they are easy to block. By 
the time your opponent has blocked the third hit, he/she will be 
ready with an attack while Julia is vulnerable. Not recommended 
unless you're playing against someone who has no idea how the 
blocking system works.  ...Worse yet, Jin can parry the first hit and 
SS around to get a free back throw!  NOT GOOD!
     On a CH, the 1~1,1 string is excellent: it deals lots of damage 
and is easy to juggle off of. It's especially good as a CH against 
aggressive slower characters, such as Hwoarang or the Mishimas.
     The Palm Explosion is a new addition to this string, and as it is 
part of this little combo, it's more likely to hit than just the Palm 
Explosion on its own. Experiment with this one a bit and you'll get a 
good sense of when you can get away with it and when you can't. If 
blocked, the Julia is at an 8-frame disadvantage - enough time for a 
fast opponent to get a jab in. Its stun properties are the same as 
the Palm Explosion on its own, so on a CH there are plenty of 
follow-ups - but with plenty of risks.
     The Bow & Arrow is a viable option against an opponent who blocks 
the 1,1 string but does not retaliate, in anticipation of the third 
1. If you are lucky, they will be blocking mid as you lash out with 
the Bow Leg. The Arrow knocks back your opponent; Julia can dash in 
for follow-ups, or take a breather.  Even at elite Tekken levels, 
Julias sometimes use 1~1,4 as a mixup to 1~1,1 -- but beware of 
opponents who like to low parry, as you will take a lot of damage if 
they do.

*df+1 - Mini G-Clef Cannon - m - 8
  = 1 - Flash Uppercut - m - 21 - launcher
  = 4 - Bow Leg - L - 12
     = 3 - Arrow - m - 15
The same as the full G-Clef Cannon, only without the first 1.  Slow as hell. :P

*1+4- Club Fist to Bow Leg - m,L - 12,12
   = 3 - Arrow - m -15
I used this move a lot when I was first learning Julia, until I 
figured out how to do her Bow & Arrow without the leading fist.  Once 
you reach an intermediate level, though, there's really no reason to 
use this anymore.

*1+2 - Rouge Orchid Palm - h - 15
A new move for Julia in Tekken 4, it's a lot faster than her 
traditional Twin Arrow, although the range is shorter. It's good for 
quick damage when your opponent is backed into a wall. If blocked 
she'll be at an 8 frame disadvantage, not bad but not wonderful -- 
use your judgement!

*b+1+2 - Twin Arrow - m - 21
Although slower than the Rouge Orchid Palm, the Twin Arrow covers a 
larger distance and does more damage. It now crumple-stuns instead of 
sending the opponent flying.  An Earthquake Stomp (u/f+3+4) is 
guaranteed to land afterwards.

*2~b or b+2 - Arm Whip - h - 12
= 1+2 - Push - n/a - n/a
If the 2 connects, Julia spins around to her opponent's back. The 
regular Arm Whip
leaves a 1-frame advantage; the Push does no damage, but stuns the 
opponent for a 4 frame advantage.
     Most opponents will either do a ducking low jab (FC or d/b+1) or 
a standing jab to turn around quickly.  If they low-jab, you can low 
parry and get a launcher.  If they use a standing jab, 1~1,1 will CH 
for juggles.

* 2+3,1 - Ultimate Cannon - Sm,m,m - 8,9,25 - launcher
or d+2,N+3,1 - Sm,m,m - 10,9,25 - launcher
It juggles but is very hard to pull off, as most experienced Tekken 
players know to expect the third blow. You can use this to your 
advantage. If your opponent seems to block all three hits before 
retaliating, perform the 2+3 string and then try a low hit, such as 
the Low Kick of the Spinning Razor Kicks combos (see below). You may 
just catch 'em by
surprise...
     Against some opponents, the first two hits of the Ultimate Cannon 
can be used as a juggle after a successful f+1.  But why bother, when 
you can use a normal juggle?  Meh, screw it.  Avoid this move!

*b+3 - Liquid Sweep - L - 12
   = 4 - Bow Leg - L - 10
The slow Liquid Sweep gets an improvement in Tekken 4! This move is 
great against opponents who like to lay on the ground. A Liquid Sweep 
followed by a Bow Leg will remind them that they aren't safe, and a 
WS Skyscraper Kick can be thrown in after for added fun...just press 
"4" after the Bow Leg connects.  You can even throw in the Liquid 
Sweep - Bow Leg after a Skyscraper Kick for mix-up fun. ^^
     Against standing opponents, a Liquid Sweep causes a Trip Stun -- 
it's great to follow up with a Shove It Up, or you can try for 
juggles. However, if the Liquid Sweep is blocked, Julia's recovery 
time is terrible -- 33 frames! -- and she is left vulnerable on her 
side on the ground. Use with caution.

*3 - Normal Left Kick - h - 25
Oh, the under-rated 3!  The range is deceptive, and it tracks well. 
Good against
opponents who charge towards you, as it hits on the 14th frame and 
knocks down.  Julia takes 16 frames to recover from a block, and the 
move can be ducked over, so use sparingly.

*FC,d/f+4 or d/f~N~4 - Bow Leg - L - 12
= 3 - Arrow - m - 15
The L/m combination makes it difficult for novice opponents to block 
or parry.  Good to
use after ducking under an opponent's attack.  Well-timed elbows will 
catch the opponent for juggles after this kick (and all the other Bow 
& Arrow combinations).  ...If you catch your opponent with a get-up 
low kick (press 3 when you are in a downed state), then a FC,d/f+4,3 
will almost always connect.

*u/f+4 - Hop Kick - m - 25 - launcher
This launches for sturdy juggle opportunities.  It recovers very 
poorly, however, so use only in situations against a spinning or 
crouched opponent.

*WS+4 - Skyscraper Kick - m - 15
Very fast, and takes good priority.

*b+4 - Heaven Shatter Kick - h - 17
This will skim right over small opponents, ducking opponents, or 
opponents who are out of range.  However, it tracks well (important 
if your opponents like to SS), and, if it connects on a CH, your 
opponent will be momentarily stunned.  Juggle time!

*u/f+3+4 - Earthquake Stomp - M - 35
Another move to use with caution. Easily blocked, difficult to aim, 
and terrible to recover from. The only times it is guaranteed to land 
are after the unblockable or b+1+2.  Don't just throw this out 
randomly; poor Julia looks ridiculous flailing her arms to regain her 
balance just as Hwoarang grabs her from behind...or whatever.

*d/f+4,2,b,f+1 - Mountain Crusher - m,m,m - 12,15,25
Very safe move to use.  All three can buffer in Mad Axes on block 
(some require a deeper "f" than others).  Julia recovers well on 
block.  And, d/f+4 can often hit grounded opponents.
     The second hit leaves Julia close if blocked, whereas the third 
pushes away. A blocked second hit can be followed by a Mad Axes throw 
or Machine Gun Punch combo; a blocked third hit can be followed by 
the 4,4 Kicks, or d,d/f+1, or other moves that bring Julia closer to 
her opponent. Julia does suffer some stun after a block, so beware of 
jab-happy opponents.
     If the third hit connects, your opponent will be knocked to the 
other end of the screen and Julia will make an annoying "yeh" sound. 
-_-

*2+3+4 - Wave Taunt - n/a - n/a
Taunts can be cancelled into regular moves, so the taunt can be used 
to lure an opponent towards you by making Julia appear vulnerable. As 
well, it's a great way to irk sore losers. ^_~



***Spinning Kick Combos***

*4,4 - Spinning Razor Kicks - h,L - 20,12
= 4 - High Kick -h - 23
= d+4 - Low Kick - L - 10
= 1 - Razor's Edge - m - 21 - launcher

*d+4 - Razor Sweep - L - 10
= 4 - High Kick -h - 23
= d+4 - Low Kick - L - 10
= 1 - Razor's Edge - m - 21 - launcher

*3+4 - Counter-Clockwise Spin - n/a - n/a
= Chains into any of the above combos

These combos have great variety and are wonderful for confusing your 
opponents, as well as chipping off plenty of damage. You can 
experiment with them, but just a couple of notes:

1) the Razor's Edge juggles, but leaves Julia very vulnerable if 
blocked. Do not abuse this move!

2) The Counter-Clockwise Spin leaves Julia vulnerable to attacks; use 
with caution against aggressive opponents. It can be used while SS or 
SW for confusion. ^_^

3) the d+4,1 is the Newbie Juggler's dream. It will connect after 
almost all launchers.

4) 3+4 is a bit slow on its own, but when used with SS or SW it can 
become dizzyingly confusing for your opponent.  After a SS, you must 
input "b+3+4" instead of 3+4, or you will get the SS+3,4 move instead.

5) on CH, a plain 4 will launch.  It is possible to juggle after it, 
but difficult.


***Tequila Sunrise Combos***

*WS+2 or 3,2 - Tequila Sunrise - m - 15
= 2 - Axe Elbow - m - 21
= 2, 2 - Delayed Elbow - m - 25
= 1 - Mini G-Clef Cannon - m - 8
     = 1 - Flash Uppercut - m - 21 - launcher
     = 4 - Bow Leg - L - 12
         = 3 - Arrow - m - 15
= 4 - Razor Sweep - L - 10
     = 4 - High Kick -h - 23
     = d+4 - Low Kick - L - 10
     = 1 - Razor's Edge - m - 21 - launcher

Another great confusing move: the Tequila Sunrise combos can be very 
confusing. The initial move is quite slow, so plan it well. They are 
often great to use on opponents who have been stunned, for example 
after a CH b+4...or after ducking an opponent's high move.  ...For 
the WS+2,4,1 variety, the 1 is guaranteed if the 4 connects, and you 
can juggle off of it.  However, your opponents may be watching for 
the 4 to block or parry it.



----------------------------

>>I) C: SIDESTEP MOVES<<

These can be input sometime between the initial SS motion to a few 
frames after the SS motion is complete.  Experiment to find different 
speeds of execution. ^_~

*SS+2 - Parting Fist - m - 21
A bit slow and short-range, but it causes a short stun on a connect. 
Julia steps towards her opponent, so make sure you aren't stepping 
into an attack!

*SS+3,4 - Twin Waking Kicks - m,h - 16,18 - launcher
Julia has inherited one of Michelle's best moves in TTT. The kicks 
are close-range, but they juggle on a normal hit. Although they don't 
launch very high, there are plenty of follow-up juggles. Again, check 
Tekken Zaibatsu's combo area for details.


----------------------------

>>I) D: UNBLOCKABLES<<

*f+1+4 - Heaven Cannon - 50 - launcher
=B - Cancel
Like all unblockables, this is slow and SSsable.  If you're going to 
risk it and use this move, make sure you cancel if you're in ANY 
danger. A follow-up Earthquake Stomp (uf+3+4) is guaranteed to hit an 
opponent that has been downed after the Heaven Cannon.



----------------------------

>>I) E: 10-HIT COMBOS<<
" = interrupt points


1) 2,1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,1 - h"mm"hLm"hh"Lm - 8,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,8,25

2) 2,1,1,2,3,3,2,3,2,1 - h"mm"hLm"mL"m! - 8,6,6,6,6,6,7,5,5,30

3) 2,1,1,2,3,3,2,1,4,3 - h"mm"hLm"mm"Lm -8,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,10,25

Like anyone's 10-hit combos, these work best against newbie 
opponents. Against more experienced players, you may face 
retaliation. Be wise. ^_~





======================
SECTION II: THROWS

The format here:
button command - name - damage - escape

>>II) A: Basic Throws<<

*1+3+direction - Position Change - n/a - 1
Good when you have your butt plastered to a wall.


*2+4 - Side Buster - 30 - 2
*F+2+4 - Death Valley Bomb - 35 - 2
Her standard 2+4 throws.


*B+2+4 - Seasaw Whip - n/a - 2
This throw will only do damage if Julia's opponent hits a wall. Her 
opponent lands on their feet if no wall is hit. ...On a wall hit, her 
opponent is pressed against the wall in a momentary stun; quick 
follow-ups area Shove It Up (f+1+2), Rouge Orchid Palm (1+2), or 
spinning kicks (4,4 series).  If you are at an angle, you can use 
elbows to juggle. TZ has some great wall combo lists to try.
     In some corners, repeated standing 4's can be timed as an 
infinite juggle, since the wall stun of the throw is inescapable. 
Just thought I'd mention it. *shrugs*

*Side/Back throws: f+2+4 or 2+4 from the...
   right = Twisted Sister - 45 - 2
   left = Running Bulldog - 40 - 1
   back = 2+4 = German Suplex - 50 - n/a; f+2+4 = Calf Branding - 50 - n/a
   The side throws are pretty much the same as in TTT. These are 
useful after an opponent misses a move that takes them off-axis, or 
after a SS.

*d,d/b+1+3 - Waist Suplex - 30 - 1
Practice hard to master this one, as it is a 1-escape, compared to 
the more common 2-escape.

*FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 - Cross Arm Lock - 45 - 1+2
A tiny bit slower than some of Julia's other throws, but look at the 
damage! ^_~ The 1+2 escape is great for opponents who mash "2" on a 
throw.
     Can also be performed as qcb,d,d/b+1+2 to do it from a standing 
position...though the best property of this throw is that it's 
performed from a FC.  Great to punish after ducking to avoid high 
moves.  Buffer from a jab!  FC+1 and hold the 1...then perform 
d/b,d,d/b+2.  Test this one out to find out if it works for you. ^^

*d/f+1+2 - Arm Lock Suplex - 37 - 1+2
Lots of damage, double-button escape.  Easier to perform than the MA 
for novices, although it's a titch slower.  Fun to use (very rarely) 
as an opening move. ^_~

*qcb,f+2 - Mad Axes - 14,14,14 - 1+2
This is Julia's signature throw. It's difficult to see coming, as 
it's quick (connecting 10 frames into the execution!); if it is 
escaped, Julia can usually recover quickly without being punished.
     The f+2 can be delayed after the qcb.  Try qcb~SS~f+2 or 
qcb,f,f+2, for example.  Since the f+2 will connect on 10 frames, 
it's nearly impossible to escape unless your opponent anticipates it.
     ABUSE THIS THROW!  More in the Mad Axes buffers section...


>>II) B: Mad Axes Buffers<<

The Mad Axes throw can be buffered in after other attacks. There are 
a whole host of MA buffers out there; a good place to check is on the 
Tekken Zaibatsu forums or in FAQ files. Some starter buffers are:

1) The Rapid Counter (WR+1 or d,df+1)

2) The Machine Gun Punch (1,2)

3) The first or second part of the Mountain Crusher (d/f+4,2)

4) Out of a SS

5) AFTER EVERY DAMN MOVE!!!

Experiment and you'll find set-ups that work for you.  Keep it fresh 
and your opponent will miss escapes.  As well, remember to mix up 
your throws so that they'll always be on their toes.

Oh, and the qcb of the Mad Axes can be buffered in before the "Fight" 
signal is called, if you want to be a cheap bastard. ^_~


===============================

SECTION III: Beyond the Basics

------------------------------

>>III) a: Juggles<<

A juggle is a series of moves that connect with an opponent's 
character before they can regain control.  Most juggles are done in 
the air, before an opponent touches the ground.

I was planning to have an entire juggles section, but now Tekken 
Zaibatsu has begun a combo compilation project: eventually, every 
Julia combo known to man (and woman) will be listed in her section. I 
encourage you to check it frequently for updates, and to experiment 
with the combos listed there. The Forums on the site are a great 
place to find combos, too.

If you want to experiment on your own, I've made a note of her 
primary launchers in the movelist. And, as I mentioned frequently in 
this FAQ, the elbow (f,f+1) is the main juggle filler.  Check out TZ 
to get a bit more creative.

Julia's standard juggles:
f,f~N~1, f,f~N~1, d,d/f+1,2
f,f~N~1, f,f~N~1, f,f~N~1, d,d/f+1,2  (sometimes, the 2 whiffs)
f,f~N~1, f,f~N~1, f,f~N~1, f,f+1,4
with f,f~N~1 being the juggling elbow discussed in the f,f+1 section.

As a note, sometimes the first f,f~N~1 will flip an opponent over 
your head (especially against a wall, after SS+3,4 or after f+1+2 
CH).  If this happens, you can continue the juggle in the opposite 
direction, but this is difficult to do.  A 3 will connect for less 
damage (but more damage than a whiffed follow-up ^_~).
Launcher, f,f~N~1 (flip), BT3.
-----------------------------

>>III) b: Wall Games<<

With the addition of walls to Tekken 4, wall combos are new to everyone, not just 
newbies! Again, Tekken Zaibatsu is a great place to find good combos.

i) After a close wall-push (f+1+3, near wall), Julia gets a free 4, 
and, in some cases, a free 1~1.  However, there are other setups you 
can use after a wall push.

ii) After a wall push, you can try for:
a) throw (preferably a quick one such as Mad Axes)
b) another wall push
c) a power move such as 1+2 or f+1+2 for a wall stun (risky)
d) a low move such as FC,d/f+4,3
e) pause, then, when the opponent thinks they are safe, 1~2,1 CH or 
1~1,1 CH, or, if they low jab, low parry to d/f+2,1
f) d/f+2,1.  Not guaranteed, so this is a bit risky, but it can get 
you a nice juggle off of it.
An opponent can tech-roll if they hit the wall at any angle but 
side-on.  Tracking moves such as b+4 will connect, as will Mad Axes 
if timed right.

iii) When your opponent is in a corner:
a) launcher to infinite 1-jabs -- this works only in certain corners, 
and is a bit cheap, but oh so much fun! ^_~
b) F+1+4 (very risky!)
c) wall push to wall push games.

iv) After a b+2+4 into a wall:
a) 1~1,1 (only connects from some angles)
b) d/f+4,2,b~f+1 (only from certain angles)
c) 4,4,1 (only from certain angles)
d) wall push to wall push games
The opponent CANNOT tech-roll after the b+2+4.
Like anything in Tekken, these must be mixed up to be effective.

v) When Julia is trapped against a wall:
a) Block.  This is the safest option, though if you are on the wall 
thanks to a wall push, you are going to eat a few hits.
b) Tech-roll (see TZ for the basics on this).  Rolling to the right 
can evade some follow-up attacks and put Julia at the opponent's side 
for a free 1~1,1.  This is risky, though, since some opponents will 
be looking for tech-rolls to punish.
c) Grab.  Very risky, as your opponent will be looking to take 
advantage of your
position.
d) 1~1,1 CH or 1~2,1 CH.  Do not try this if you have just been 
pushed into a wall, unless you see your opponent starting up a slow 
move.
e) Wall jump.  Every character has a wall jump (b,b,u/b), but they 
are considered too slow to use in most situations; hence, this is 
very risky, as well.

---------------------------

>>III) c: Crouch Games <<

First thing about the crouch game is how to get into a crouched state 
(apart from holding d/b).  Here is a list of moves that recover 
crouching (ie: leave you in a FC state for a short while, even if she 
appears to be standing).
  - a small or large hop (u/f or U/F)
  - Bow Leg - (FC,d/f+4 and variations, eg: chained from G-Clef punches)
  - G-Clef Cannon to Low Kick - (1,2,3)
  - Slow Power Punch to Low Kick (d/f+2,3)
  - Razor Sweep (d+4 and variations, eg: from Tequila Sunrise combos or from 4)
  - Razor Sweep to Low Kick (d+4,d+4 and variations, eg: 4,d+4,d+4)
  - Liquid Sweep (b+3)
  -d/b+3
  -d/b+4
  -d/b+1

Options from a Crouched State
a) mixup of FC,d/f+2 and FC,d/f+4,3.  Oldest trick in the book, but 
it still works pretty well.  The FC,d/f+2 is very punishable on 
block, and the FC,d/f+4,3 is parryable, so be careful with these 
mixups.

b) WS moves:
-WS+1: fast (11 frames), and safe (only leaves Julia at a 4 frame 
disadvantage when
blocked).  Does very little damage, but gives an impressive +7 
advantage to Julia on block, so it can be used as a setup tool.
-WS+2: Slow, and punishable on block, but good for mixups.
-WS+3: Slow and punishable, but it tracks fairly well.
-WS+4: Punishable on block, but quick (as fast as WS+1), and it 
knocks down for juggle damage!

c) Throws:  FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 is the obvious choice here, but any of 
her standard throws work nicely.

d) Any standard move.

e) Do nothing.  Laugh at the panic on your opponent's face as they 
wonder what you are planning.  Watch them throw out a mid move in an 
attempt to nail you; interrupt with d/b+1 and start the crouch games 
over again.  Can you feel the tension?  I SAID, CAN YOU?!??! ....erm, 
moving right along:

---------------------------

>>III) d: Okizeme<<

Okizeme is a fancy word for mix-ups when an opponent is down (or on a 
wall, but we'll ignore that part, since we already covered it ^_~). 
Okizeme is especially important for Julia because her primary move 
(elbow) knocks down.

i) If your opponent hesitates in getting up, or does the "quick rise" 
(mash 2+up):
a) b+3, d/b+3, or another move that will contact with an opponent on 
the ground.  Your opponent can use the "quick get up" and low parry, 
but only if they anticipate your move.  This puts you into FC, so use 
the FC mixups afterwards.
b) u/f+3+4.  DON'T USE THIS MOVE unless you've just connected a b+1+2 
or F+1+4.  You will suffer.
c) wait until the opponent rises, then throw.  If you practice 
enough, you can time the throw so that you grab your opponent before 
they even appear to be fully standing.
d) wait until the opponent rises, then throw out a mid-hitting move 
that will connect before they can block.  d/f+2,1 is the easiest to 
time this with, though F+1 and f+1~2 work, too, and d/f+4,2,b~f+1. 
There is a VERY short period time as an opponent rises where he/she 
will be *unable* to block.  Practice hard, and you'll nail them every 
time.

ii) If your opponent does a get-up kick:  (ie: 3, d+4, or 4 from a 
downed state)
a) parry (if it's 3 or d+4) into d/f+2,1
b) SS and throw.  I have been told that a SS to throw will interrupt 
a get up kick.
c) d/f+2,1 seems to interrupt a kick if you anticipate it; again, 
this is hard to time.
d) block (if it's a 4) and resume play.
e) a well-timed f,f+1 will interrupt and juggle.

iii) If your opponent tech-rolls forward or backward:
This is Julia's dream situation.  On an opponent's tech-roll she can land:
a) d/f+4,2,b~f+1, guaranteed if you time it correctly.
b) d/f+2,1: very easy to time.
c) F+1+4, if you're quick and you know your opponent will hesitate. 
This is a risky
option.
d) f,f+1 (will juggle if timed correctly)
...I think you get the idea.  Basically, when an opponent tech-rolls 
backwards, it as if they have set Julia up for a juggle.  Punish 
accordingly. ^_~

iv) If your opponent does a back-handspring get-up:
Wait until the handspring is about to finish, then land a throw or 
d/f+2,1 as they land.
Or, use d/f+4,2,b~f+1.

v) If your opponent rolls to the right or left:
I'm not too sure about okizeme options here; for now, I'll say, same 
as the hesitation or "quick rise" options.

---------------------------

>>III) e: Opponents<<

This section is intended for people looking for basic strats against 
different types of opponents.

i) *The Evasors & Turtles:*

Any opponent who enjoys side-walking and side-stepping, waiting with 
inhuman patience for you to make a mistake.  Quite honestly, Turtlers 
are Julia's worst enemy., since so many of her moves can be avoided 
with SSs.

Poke, poke, poke.  You know her 8-frame jab?  Use it!  Low kicks. 
Remember, one error on their part can lead to a CH juggle for 60+ 
damage.  Don't let them get to you; turtle back!  Makes for a boring 
match, but you may end up victorious.

For SWing opponents, Julia's best-tracking moves are the standing 3 
and b+4 (which has horrible range).  Most of her moves track better 
out of a SS.

ii) The Bulldogs:*

An opponent who attacks continually, often using string attacks: they 
can be very
intimidating. Again, all characters can be a bulldog, although you 
may often see bulldog Hwoarangs, Pauls and, yes, Julias.  Two 
letters: CH!  Timing your 1~1,1's and 1~2,1's can turn a match 
completely in your favour.  Low parry the low moves.  Block.  Be 
patient.

As a note, Julia makes a great bulldog, especially on wide-range 
levels such as the Airport level. Her CH WR+1,2s can drive a beginner 
opponent insane. *insert evil laughter here*

iii) *The Throw-Happy Opponents:*

Often King, although I qualify Marduk's tackle as a throw of sorts. 
There are a few things you can do to protect yourself from them:

1) Learn the escapes from King's chain throws.  No-brainer here.  If 
you can escape, you'll live.

2) Practice the escape from Marduk's tackle. It's difficult to time 
right at first, but this, too, can save your life.

3) Keep them at a distance. The Mountain Crusher, Bow & Arrow, 
Standing 3, and Spin Kicks combos are all good tools for giving 
yourself some breathing room, as are well-timed launch and stun 
moves. Both f+1+2 and f+1~2 duck under many of the grabs for combo 
opportunities on CH.  As well, f+1 can sometimes punish a throw 
attempt.  ...Or, FC under their throw, and perform Julia's FC moves 
or FC throw.

iv) *The Mashers:*

Christie button-mashers and Hwoarang 3434334334443434 mashers.  They're
everywhere.  They can be annoying for newbies like you and me, but 
watch their play style; they get predictable very quickly. ...Enjoy 
wiping the floor with their ass.  ...If they continue to win, suggest 
that they mash Yoshimitsu and hope they commit suicide.

v) *Jin*

He gets a section all to himself because Julia has a particularly 
tough time against him.  Jin's favourite move to abuse is the LS 
(Laser Scraper combo), both in JF (just frame) form and regular form. 
This move consists of three punches; the third one launchers for 
insane juggle damage.  The JF version is fast and unblockable.

The best way to get out of LS is to block the first 2 hits and SSR to 
avoid the 3rd.  To train yourself to do this, go to the practice 
arena (if you're using a PS2 and not learning in the arcade).  Choose 
yourself as Julia and Jin as your opponent.  Press <start> and move 
the menu until you reach "Defensive training."  Go through Jin's menu 
and highlight the Laser Scraper.  Now, you can practice against him 
to get the timing.  Block the first two, then tap so that Julia 
sidesteps *to her right*.  You will avoid the third hit.

Thus, SS+3,4 becomes a very useful tool.  Press 3,4 after you SS the 
LS, and you will get a free juggle.  Nifty, right? ^_~

The delayed versions of the LS and the JF versions are a bit trickier 
to SS.  In fact, there's one version of the JFLS that is (debateably) 
impossible to SS escape.  However, you don't have to worry about this 
until you are competing at a more advanced level.  Recently, a method 
has been found that sometimes allows all characters to sidestep to 
Jin's left and get a free back throw; however, this is still debated 
heavily, and very tricky to do, so don't concern yourself with it for 
now. ^_~

Another option is to counter LS before it begins.  Since 1~2 is 
short-ranged compared with Jin's LS, you are probably better off 
using a simple 4.  On CH, 4 will juggle, and it recovers pretty well 
on block.

To do well against a good Jin, Julia really has to turtle and throw 
out elbows and random pokes.  His parry makes some of her key moves 
(such as 1~1,1) almost useless; Julia has to play it safe to the 
point where you may feel as if you are using only her elbow and 
throws.  However, a lot of characters have problems with Jin, so 
there are loads of anti-Jin strats out there.  Again, the Tekken 
Zaibatsu forums are a great place to look for updated information.

vi) *8-frame jabbers*

Tekken characters can be broken into two categories, based on their 
standing jab (1) speed.  The first are the "8-frame jabbers": Bryan, 
Julia, Law, Lee, Lei, Nina, Paul, Steve, Xiaoyu, Yoshimitsu.  Julia 
has a little bit of a tougher time against these characters, since 
she relies so heavily on CH -- and it's difficult to CH a character 
using fast moves.  Certain characters, such as Lee and Nina, can 
combine their speed and evasive moves to make a real tough fight for 
Julia. ...Just something to keep in mind. ^_~  ...Be especially wary 
of Xiaoyu and Yoshimitsu: they have moves that are even quicker than 
their jabs.

vii) *10-frame jabbers*

Christie, Heihachi, Hwoarang, Jin, Kazuya, King (9 frames), Kuma (10 
frames with 2; 20 with 1).  Since these characters have slower lead 
jabs, it is (theoretically) easier for Julia to CH them with her 
8-frame strings.  ...As well, after a blocked elbow, Julia takes 2 
frames to recover.  2 frames + an 8 frame jab = cancels a 10-frame 
jab.  If the opponent wants to beat you, they will have to use a low 
jab (d/b+1 or FC+1), which can both be low-parried.  Thus, many 
10-frame characters will lock up and block after a blocked elbow: 
this is where delayed f,f+1,4 and f,f+1 to throw mixups are very 
handy, as they can train your opponent to try to interrupt -- and 
you'll get a free 1~2,1 or low parry to d/f+2,1.

----------------------------------------

>>III) f: Things to Keep in Mind<<

Some of Julia's simplest moves can be the most effective.  I don't 
know how many matches I lost as a beginner because I tried to make 
things too fancy. So, keep it simple!  Watch match videos of Julia in 
action, and you'll realize that her elbow and CH strings are the key 
to even a Julia expert's game. The best way to get better is to 
practice...preferably against real people, since the CPU in Tekken 4, 
quite frankly, sucks.  Tekken-playing friends can help you learn new 
tactics and make learning fun (yayyy!). As well, friends are often 
the scrubbiest  opponents you will ever have, as they aren't afraid 
of being cheap! ^^ If, like me, your friends are sick of Tekken, an 
online community such as TZ can keep you motivated and update you on 
new strategies. As well, try to meet people at the arcade. It's fun 
having a familiar face to compete against, especially if you want to 
try something new and are a bit nervous about it.

As well, don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, or you'll never 
learn. If you're too shy to ask dumb questions at the arcade (I'm a 
girl, so most men assume I'm video-game retarded, which works to my 
advantage when I have a question)...well, an online community such as 
TZ is great, because everyone's anonymous. And don't be afraid to 
email me at kuni@kuni-bob.com. I love asking dumb questions, so if I 
don't know the answer, I'll find out for you! ^^

Lastly...my father used to say this to me all the time, and it drove 
me CRAZY, but it's true (sigh): it's all a head game. How do you 
think Tekken Tournaments are won? Everyone there has amazing skills, 
but often it comes down to who is the most confident and comfortable 
with their skills. (Confidence does NOT equal bravado...bragging will 
only make you new enemies.) Be proud of what you learn, and don't be 
afraid to try out new stuff.  Mush, mush, gush, gush, hug.  (Well, 
it's true, damnit!)

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and please email me at 
kuni@kuni-bob.com if you have any questions or suggestions. This FAQ 
project is ongoing, so expect updates soon. ^_^
Good luck, and have fun!

First, thanks to Namco for not suing me for loving their game so much 
that I've written an FAQ about it, as well as done smutty stories, 
provocative artwork, and spent hour upon hour manipulating Tekken 
action figures in all the wrong ways.  ...Did I just say that? O_o;;

Thanks to Tekken Zaibatsu for the frame data, and the Canadian 
Players Thread and Julia Strats Thread for answering my dumb 
questions. ^_^

Big thanks to the folks in Vancouver and my "kids"/team members in 
Victoria for helping me learn the game the fun way -- by playing.

Also, kudos to my AIM buddies for answering my stupid questions about 
game basics.  You're a friendly bunch; you know who you are. ^_~

And special thanks to Paddy for not questioning the amount of time 
and money I've put into this video-game...love ya, hon!  *big squishy
