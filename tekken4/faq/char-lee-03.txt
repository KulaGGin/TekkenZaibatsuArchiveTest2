~ 3. Introduction ~
===================

Ah, so you've been wondering who this fool is huh?  Well, with no further ado... I am
RJ Zaragoza.  Born and raised in the Philippines and now living in California, USA for a 
year.  Maybe some knows me from tekken zaibatsu forums.  My screen name is Deadly_Fury.
I wrote this faqs for all those Lee players out there who are begining, intermmediate or an 
amatuer with Lee Chaolan.  So, if you are a master with Lee you can just leave this page and
look for another faqs containing "skills for a master". If you're willing to stay and e-mail
just to humiliate me, then leave.  If you're a girl, 18-20 years of age, tall, fair complexion,
single, cute or pretty you can mail me. haha! j/k!! But if you want to learn and are willing 
to contribute, then thank you and enjoy.  

I am not really a good Lee player nor a master, I just started using him recently and 
I'm getting the hang of him.  I like this guy because he's cool, flashy and easy to use.  
His combos are long but has low damage.  But dont hang your heads now. You dont need hard 
damaging combos to win.  Thats why I've put up a section for offense and defense that 
might help you in winning more.  It's just set-ups confusing moves and ground moves that 
will make Lee a deadly fighter.  So tighten up your gloves and let us begin.

~ 5. Who is Lee Chaolan a.k.a "Silver haired demon"? ~
======================================================

I dont know how Lee's story goes back from Tekken 1 days.  So, I'll just put his Tekken 4 
story here.  Remember that Lee is also Violet in Tekken 4 (for all those who doesnt know).  

PROFILE: Lee Chaolan 
  
Country of Origin : Japan 
Fighting Style : Mishima Style Fighting Karate and Martial Arts 
Age : 48 
  
*CHARACTER STORY*
  
After he betrayed Heihachi and sided with Kazuya at The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2, Lee 
was expelled from the Mishima Zaibatsu.  For quite sometime, thoughts of revenge consumed 
Lee. Eventually, he realized that it was pointless to kill an old man who probably had only 
a few years left in his life at best. With that realization, Lee distanced himself from 
fighting and moved to a mansion in the Bahamas to lead a solitary life. One day, he 
discovered a huge sell-off of G Corporation's stock online. Lee's intuition told him that 
something happened within the company. His intuition was correct. He hacked into their 
classified computer network and accessed their internal corporate communications. Lee 
learned that the Mishima Zaibatsu attacked G Corporation and caused significant damage to 
their research facilities.

He also came across information that a new life form under development by the Mishima 
Zaibatsu would be completed by next year. In order to complete the life form, however, it 
appeared that they were missing a critical component... Oddly enough, an announcement was 
made for The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 around the same time. Lee's fading passion for 
fighting was rekindled - along with his resentment towards the Mishima clan.  In order to 
prevent the Mishima Zaibatsu from discovering his true identity, Lee signed up for the 
Tournament online under a false name. As an additional measure to mask his identity, he 
dyed his gleaming silver hair purple. 


PROFILE:  Violet 
  
Country of Origin : Bahamas 
Fighting Style : Mishima Style Fighting Karate and Martial Arts 
Age : 45 
  
*CHARACTER STORY* 
  
Violet is a majority shareholder and the de facto leader of a manufacturer of humanoid robots. 
Apparently a fighter in his past, he lived a quiet life in a mansion in the Bahamas. Bored by 
his career lifestyle, Violet decided to enter The King of the Iron Fist Tournament 4.  The 
senior executives in his company wrote this off as the mere diversions of a rich man. In any 
event, there were no weaknesses in Violet's physique, forged by state of the art training 
equipment.  There was another significant reason for his entrance in the tournament.  Violet 
believed that he could complete the ultimate fighting weapon based on his pursuit of 
developing advanced humanoids. He believed in a utopian world where inorganic humanoids would 
carry out the will of their human masters.

But the tide of technology in the world favored biotechnology. The Mishima Zaibatsu and 
Heihachi Mishima were part of this movement, seekers of unfathomable power through genetic 
engineering.  Violet accelerated the development of a prototype humanoid for the tournament. 
If the prototype could be completed in time, he could leverage this tournament as an 
excellent PR tool. Violet's mind was filled with visions of him and his prototype dominating 
The King of the Iron Fist Tournament 4.

~ 7. Move Definition ~
======================

This section is for the definition of "some" moves in the movelist.  All moves listed here 
are most commonly used for human opponents or in tournaments.

1,2 ~f,n Double Punch - mist step

All characters have this basic 1,2 punch combo.  But Lee has a great advantage with his 1,2
cuz he has a mist step after it.  This is good for ground mix-ups and to keep you opponent
guessing.  Use this too for juggles, it keeps your opponent airborn longer than other characters.

1,2,2  Double punch - Violet knuckle

Good combo to use while on ground.  It has a quick recovery and pushes the opponent back 
a little.

1:3:3:3   Acid rain combo

Ah! this is one of Lee's JF moves.  The first 2 hits high the 2nd hits mid and the last hits 
high and when it connects it does a CFS which is a great set-up for a juggle.  I cant seem to pull 
this off that often, timing is really hard.  One flaw about this is the recovery and the 
open for an opponent to attack you.  You can buffer the last hit and block before this happens.

1,2,4:4   Double punch - silver rain kick

Lee's got another combo in his arsenal.  It's good namco gave him this cuz almost everyone had
a 1,2 combo then a kick.  Lee kicks the opponent in the mid section and you've noticed it has a 
JF.  When timed correctly the kick will do more damage and give a HS on a normal hit!  You can 
also just do 1,2,4 if you cant time it well, it does a good damage too without the JF.  I was 
told the timing was when the kick connects, you hit the 4!  It's just practice, practice,
practice!

SS+2 ~f,n  Rear cross punch - mist step

A good set-up!  I heard SS+2 can evade almost any high attacks like jabs.  This is great to use
too because it can be followed to a mist step which makes it more confusing for the opponent.
Mix any mid attack to this move.

D+4,4,4,4 [~3]    Laser edge rush - [HMS]

A cheesy Lee player will use this.  Also good Lee player uses this.  The 3 kicks hits low and the
last hits mid.  You can go into HMS after the combo which is a good way to confuse you opponent.
This also great against newbie players who doesnt know how to block it. hehe!

d+4 N 4,4,4     Laser edge - machine gun kicks

This hits low, then goes high.  Its best to use this at close range cuz if you're away or it 
wiffs your very open to attacks which can be deadly.  This move also is great for CH an attack.

b+3<3        Mist wolf combo

A great way to keep the opponent away.  This hits mid then High but be extra careful because 
the opponent can duck the last hit and hit you with their stonger moves.  It's best to just
do b+3 if you see this happen.

d,d/b+4      Blazing kick

This is a great launcher.  Lee crouches down that can avoid high attacks and it has good recovery 
time.  When blocked it pushes the opponent a little.Also it hits the opponent up high into the air 
that makes you think of combos to do while he comes down.  But in tekken 4, it looks like the 
recovery time for this move was toned down?  But still, its the best launcher Lee has.


U/F+4_u/f+4   Hop kick _ Violet knee

Another good launcher for Lee.  These move hits mid so for those who crouch are in big trouble!
But yet, I havent mastered how to get the move I want like for instance If I want a Violet 
knee it sometimes come out a Hop kick!  Can anyone tell me how to time the U/F and u/f!

f+4        Silver whip

I havent seen this done on tournaments but I use this.  Some told me it's fast but has a poor
recovery.  It is true!!  This move is used just to stop a barraging jabber or to insult.  BTW,
this hits high.

d,d/f+4     Silver tail

This is great because it has a long reach.  Problem is the recovery time.  I bet this is dangerous 
to use if your close-by.  The opponent can get hit by it but it leaves you open for awhile for
them to counter your attack.  I use this for people who loves to lie down like Lei!  This move
hits grounded opponents for those who doesnt know.

4, (u_u/f)+3    Roundhouse - somersault

This move is great because it has good range and the somersault has a very quick recovery.  
The 4 is good too for CH.  The 4 hits high then the last hits mid.  So even they crouch to
avoid the 4, they usually get hit by the somersault.

b+3~3 [:4]      Feint mist wolf - [Mist trap]

The trap is back!  I like this because you can do damage to opponents who loves to turtle!  Also,
the trap can now be executed even when hit!  Unlike in TTT it only works on block.  Be careful
cuz this hits high which can be ducked!

HMS 2           Scatter blow

A good launcher from HMS.  This hits mid so try to confuse you opponent to go from standing to 
crouching. hehe!

WS+3,3          Tsunami Kick

A great way to attack for WS.  You can also start to do the infinite kicks if you want.  But 
end it as the 1st kick of the rave kicks connects.

d/f+1     

This is'nt in the move list but it is really helpful!  It hits mid so it's best to use this for 
mix-up moves.. Like after the 1,2 f,n.  

d/f+2

Another move not listed.  A quick uppercut which launches an opponent on CH.  Good move to use
to start the round as most opponents fall for this trap.

b+1,1,2_b+1,N+1,2     Triple Fang_Alternate Triple Fang

A good combo.  The triple fang hits high, mid and high while the alternate Triple fang hits high,
high and high.  The last hit of the alternate triple fang does a GB on block or a KND when hit.  
But both of them are risky to use cuz the last move hits high which can be ducked and countered 
by the opponent.  To use this move effectively is to go to HMS after b+1,1 by pressing 3+4 or 
by doing a mist step by pressing ~f n.  Once there, mix evrything up and you'll do just fine!


=====================
~ 8. Defense Tactic ~
=====================

Getting hit all the time or just need to improve in your defense?  Well, this section will feature
defence tactics for lee.  Remember, I am not a master this is just my opinion.  Please correct me 
if I am wrong.

All of us or some of us gets hit in a match.  I never saw a good player playing against a 
good player win with a perfect life bar.  Maybe if you're that lucky, it could happen also 
against newbie players but if it always happen.. how the hell do you do it? 

Everyone has the command to block by pressing b or d/b.  b for a standing block and d/b for a
crouching block.  I dont know, but if the joystick is on neutral does it still block? Because 
my arcade doesnt do it anymore.  Okey, everyone knows how to block.  Now how do you avoid getting 
hit that often?

First, the cheesiest thing to do!  Turtle!!  Yes, the annoying thing to do in a match just 
waiting for you opponent to make a mistake and then you rush in and hit him with all you've
got!  Turtling with Lee is really hard to do.  Lee doesnt have the right moves that can make 
him turtle effectively.  But here are some moves to use in turtling:

SS+2~f,1,2,4:4 
HMS
1,2,4:4 
u/f+4 to 4,4,4 wall juggle ender

Turtling is a great way to stay out of trouble but to those who doesnt want to turtle.. 

Side Stepping is a great way to avoid some mid and high hits.  Be careful for Jin's LS he 
can hit you while you SS.  Another way is to do your back flip [b,b N+3+4] this way you can 
get out of close range to get some breathing room.  Going to HMS (hit man stance) also helps,
it avoids high attack and blocks automatically.  

Also staying away from corners is essential.  Corners can be your friend but sometimes can 
be your foe.  To avoid walls or corners you can do a position change, perform a throw and do
a wall jump.  Wall jump is done when your back is near a wall but it's risky to do this.  You 
might get caught with a good timed jab now you're air born for a juggle.  

Poking is the most common move to keep your defence beefed up.  The crucial FC+1 can stop a 
combo or a  powerful move.  It gives you a little breathing space too.  Use this also to chip
a little life it's small in damage but will really count in the long run.  Standing 4 also 
works but it hits high.  I usually use FC+1!

Well I think thats a little knowledge for all you beginners out there.  If you already know 
this and want to flood my mail with flame mail...then I didnt make it clear to you that leave
if you just want to do this!!

=====================
~ 9. Offense Tactic ~
=====================

Now for the offense.  This is for those who want to pit-bull or make your opponent's eyes go 
in circles.  Lee is great for confusing your opponent and this will make you a deadly player!  

First off, f,n - the mist step is so essential to Lee's offensive arsenal.  Two of his moves 
links into mist step. Like 1,2 ~f,n,  SS+2 ~f,n... Use these to confuse and to keep your 
opponent guessing.  After a mist step, put in: 

d/f+1 or U/F+4 or u/f+4 or d/f+3 or 3,4.  

The mist step could cancel to HMS.  Then there mix any HMS moves.  Also do a wave dash but
remember to press ~b right after the mist step to block anything an opponent throws at you.  If 
you love to SS (like me), do SS+2 or SSL+4 or SSR+3 to HMS.  Poking also is a good offensive 
attack.  I usually do FC+1 then while still crouching press 4. Human opponents are lazy blocking 
low, so this is a quick way to cash in some points!!! 

For bulldog fighters, try abusing F+1,2,2 , d/f+3 , d/f+1 , b+3.  Also in wall juggles, 
always try to use Lee's 4,4,4 as an ender when your opponent hit a wall.  They wont be able 
to escape because a wall escape can only be done when your feet hits the ground.  

Also cash in some points while your opponent is on the ground.  They're vulnerable so 
it's best to hit them while you can.  d,d/f+4 and d/b+3 for Lee are moves that hit grounded 
opponents.  I usually use d,d/f+4 because of it's range.
