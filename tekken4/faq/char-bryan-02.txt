*Introduction*
**************

This FAQ is for all those beginners who use Bryan or want to learn to use him.  
We all have our reasons, so just continue reading and see what's up with him
in his latest Tekken adventure.

I made this FAQ and my previous FAQs mainly for myself. I used it as a guide
for which moves to use under various conditions. I've always believed in
sharing my wealth so I would like to pass on this knowledge to anybody else
who wishes to learn Mr. Fury. Hell, when people ask me for some strats on
certain players, it's easier for me to direct them to this FAQ.

This is an early version of the FAQ.  There are many things still to sort out 
and a lot of aspects of the game that is still to be developed.  If there are 
errors, holes, or strats to add, you are more than welcome to kindly send an 
email.

I'm assuming that you know the conventions such as 1_2 and so on.  Here's just
a rundown on all the buttons and directions.  I think the illustration below
insults your intelligence, but if ya stil need them...

I'm guessing that you're aware of the PS2 buttons, so I won't use an illustration
here.  Plus, everyone has their own button layout.

      *: Hold the button                       SS: Side step (u_d)
     CH: Counter hit (interrupt an opp's move)  ~: Input next command immediately

*Who is this Mad Man?*
**********************

Bryan Fury is a snappy dresser who's trained in the art of American Kickboxing. 
Okay, it's not the most accurate portrayal of kickboxing, but it's somewhat close. He
arguably has the best winning pose in the game (hold 1) and the most evil laugh. 
That's all you need to know about him. That's all you need to know. Do you really
care about his story? What is this? The Bryan's Story FAQ? Read that somewhere else!

Bryan has a good mix of power and speed. He plays a good mixup and can juggle as
well. He has one of the deadliest FC mixups in the game.

***********
*Move list*
***********

Okay, maybe not. There is no movelist on this FAQ. Honestly, if you need one that
badly, check out www.tekkenzaibatsu.com; www.tekkencentral.com; and many other FAQs
that lists Bryan's moves (Specifically Catlord's. You do know Catlord, don't you?).
Tekken websites also gives you frame rates, damage properties, and such detailed info
as well. Please check there if you need it that badly. I'm just assuming you know
all of Bryan's moves and just want to know how to play him (or at least how I do).

****************
*In depth moves*
****************

The following are moves I use the majority of my matches. If some moves I find are
pretty useless, I won't mention it, unless it's so bad I gotta say why. In no
particular order, here are Bryan's moves that I use a lot during his fights. Word
of advice: These moves are what I consider to be good moves, but do not pick one
move and stick with it the entire match a la deathfist.

Punch Rush (1,2...)

Jabbing has become an essential part of Tekken 4.  Every character has a string that
is set up by 1,2.  Bryan is no different.  After 1,2 Bryan can do the following:

 - 1,2 - No longer guaranteed on a CH anymore unfortunately. If the last hit connects,
  your opponent is knocked away.
 - 1,4 - Good annoying mixup due to the low kick.
 - 3 - Low kick. Good mixup.

Gatling Combo (3,2,1...)

Another good alternative setup.  The first three hits are guaranteed on a CH.  You
have the option to finish with the following:

 - 2 - Knock away mid hitting punch.
 - 4 - Annoying low kick.

Punch Kick Cross (1~4...)

2 quick high hits.  If the first connects, the 2nd is guaranteed.  Definitely useful in
custom strings and setups.  Using the following followups are optional:

 - 2,1... - Refer to the Doom Knuckle string
 - 3,3

Bryan is pretty much free to execute any string after this.

Gut Lift (d+2)

Juggle filler and does a quick lift stun. Most people go on the defensive if they eat
this move.

Doom Knuckle String (b+2,1...)

Although the start of the string hits high, it can be quite powerful. If the 2nd punch
connects, your opponent will crumple stun. The following are the rest of the string's
follow ups:

 - 2 - Bryan's all powerful mach punch.
 - 4 - Guard stun, but reversable.
 - SS - Side Step fake that can be followed up by the rest of the string.

Stomach Combo(f+2,1,4)

If the first punch connects, the rest of this string is guaranteed with good damage.
Even if the knee is blocked, the opponent is knocked away leaving Bryan safe from harm.

Body Shots (df+1,2)

If the first punch connects, the 2nd is guaranteed.

Machine Gun Punches (df+1,1,1,1,2)

Just like the previous move, but use this only after a wall push (1+3+direction).

Hammer Driver (FC_N_d+1+2)

This double punch combo has an amazing tracking ability and a slight back sway property.
Good vs. SSers and jabbers.

Snake Uppercut (qcf_WS+1)

A reason why crouching one should never duck while Bryan's FC or swaying towards them.

Snake's Edge (df+3)

This long range sweep causes a nasty float juggle. This kick has improved this time
around. No more stagger from block and faster. Do not abuse this and it'll come in
handy.

Hammer Knee (qcf_WS+3) Press 4 for Twin Hammer

Deadly knee option in Bryan's FC game.  Catch this on a CH, your opponent is stunned
and susceptible to the Snake Slam launcher.  If your opponent blocks and tries to
retaliate, use the other knee to snuff out the attack.

Knee Lift (b+4)

If you know your opponent will be crouching, this kick will knock them in the air.
Use this after a low parry.

Punch Parry (b+1+2~2)

If you can see a punch coming, by no means just punish your opponent for their
predictability.  Watch out when doing this against Steve Fox.  If you try to follow
up after parrying his left punch, he may Sway and dodge Bryan's Mach Breaker.

Regular throws (2+4_f+2+4)

A throw is a throw and it's essential in every Tekken game.  Unfortunately, this
is Bryan's only throw and has a 2 escape.  If Bryan is not FC and tries to grab,
the throw should always be broken.

Chains of Misery (FC,df,d,df+1+2)

One of the coolest throws in the game.  Anything involving Bryan laughing is cool.
Nice, powerful, and a good mixup from FC.

Change Position (1+3+f_u_d_b)

Something new added in Tekken 4.  Get yourself out of a corner and put your
opponent into one by forcing a side switch with this command.  You may shove your
opponent into a wall by pushing them into one.  Your opponent is stunned briefly
which can set you up for quick jabs or some throws.

Taunt (1+3+4)

**********
*The Game*
**********

As you fight, you'll be put into various situations.  Here are some moves that I've
suggested during each scenario.

Pre fight - What you do right off the bat can determine the outcome and flow of the
           match.  Now that can move before throwing out moves, it's good to get
           some good positioning before duking it out.

 Before the announcer says fight:

   - SSing - A good idea to move yourself into open area and not close to a wall.
   - F dash - Show your aggressiveness before a fight.  Also an indication that
    you'll go for a throw.  Watch out for jabs or a throw when the fight begins.
   - B dash - Shows defensiveness and turtling.  Watch out for throws.
   - FC - Get into position for a deadly FC game.
   - Hop over - If you can time this right, just when the announcer shouts "Fight!"
    you can find yourself behind your opponent and with a free kick.

 When the announcer says "Fight":

   - Pokes/Custom - Use some annoying but quick tick damage to start the match.  Your
    opponent would've probably have done the same.  Best way to start on offense.
   - Idle - Stand still, block, then retaliate.  Starting on defense can be
    rewarding at times.  There's no risk of receiving a CHed attack from your
    opponent and you have the opportunity to read some tendencies and patterns in
    one string or series.  Watch out for throws though.
   - FC mixup - Start a match with Bryan's forté
   - Snake's Edge (df+3) - Go low and with a launcher.  Do not abuse since your opponent
    can catch on.

Pokes/Custom - Now that everybody fights without a partner, ticking and chipping away at
       your opponent's life is more important than ever.  Poking and jabbing is a
       big part of Bryan's game.  This is the key part of my cheese game.  Here are
       some of the things you can chain together to make cheese:

   - Punch Rush - No explanation, is there?
   - Gatling Combo - See the move above this.
   - Punch Kick Cross (1~4) - Both hits high, so watch for crouchers.  Use followups if
    necessary.
   - Body Shots (df+1,2) - Custom string filler
   - Low jab (d+1) - A great way to get into FC and utilize its mixups.
   -  (f+2,1,4) - 

Just remember that you do not have to complete each string before going into the next
one.

Whiff punisher - If your opponent does a move from too far and completely misses,
                you've successfully dodged it, or you blocked a move with lots of
                recovery, try these:

   - Throws - Easy damage.  You could've done something better.
   - Launchers - You're guaranteed some hits after knocking them in the air.
   - Pokes/Custom - Start your barrage of annoyances with this.
   - Mach Breaker (f,f+2) - Knock your opponents back with a punch to the head.
   - (d+2) - A weird lift stun.  Momentarily confuse your opponent and definitly put
    them back on the defensive.
   - Slash Kick (f,f+3) - Send your opponent rolling back and hopefully into a wall.
   - Spinning Elbow (f+1+2) - 
   - Wolf Bite (df+4) - Instant knockdown and gives Bryan a good mix up for wake up
    games.
   - Hammer Driver (1+2) - If an opponent tries SSing after anything, track 'em down.
   - Meteor Blow (f+1+4) - Guaranteed damage if it isn't SSed.
   
Okizeme - Sure, hitting people when they're down is cheap (by scrubs), but it's legal.
         So, that should apply here.  Bryan has some good moves to punish grounded
         victims.  These are the moves that I use in okizeme and their situations:

   - Snake Sweep (df+3) - When your opponent lies still
   - Slash Kick (f,f+3) - When your opponent tries rolling backwards.
   - Mach Kick (f,f+4) - 
   - Wolf Bite (df+4) - When your opponent tries rolling backwards.

FC mixup - Bryan has one of the most devastating FC mixup games in Tekken.  If his
          opponent guesses wrong, they're in for some punishment.  Here's what Bryan
          can and should do while crouching:

  - Snake Uppercut (WS+1) - Nice mid hitting launcher.  You should know what to do
   from here.
  - Fisherman's Slam (WS+2,b_f+2) - Bounce launcher alternative.
  - Hammer Knee (WS+3) - Good damage and even better on a CH.
  - Chains of Misery (FC,df,d,df+1+2) - Think of this nasty throw as a low hit
   alternative.
  - Throw (2+4) - If your opponent breaks the Chains of Misery all the time, switch
   up your throw usage by crouch cancelling into this.

Launchers - Bryan has amazing launchers to initiate a juggle game.  Unfortunately,
           he doesn't have good moves for high damaging juggles.  Anyways, here are
           Bryan's best launchers:

  - Snake Uppercut (qcf_WS+1)
  - (qcb+2)
  - Snake Slam (b,b+1) - Cool Bounce juggle.
  - Fisherman's Slam (qcf_WS+2~b_f+2) - Another cool Bounce juggle.
  - Snake's Edge (df+3) - More of a float juggle.
  - Orbital Heel (uf+4) - Weird looking float juggle.
  - Knee Lift (b+4) - Launches crouchers. Use this after a low parry.

If you want to be successful with juggles, you have to have the mentality that all
your launchers will connect.  That way when you see your opponent in the air, you
won't be caught off guard.

Juggles - Even though it's not the same as in the previous Tekkens, Bryan does
         possess some ability to juggle, even if it is toned down. All juggles have
         been toned down in T4. Here are a few simple juggles that I use:

   - qcf_WS+1,b+2,1,4 - Really simple juggle.
   - b,b+1_uf+4,d+2,1,ff+2 - Easy to do.
   - df+3,WS+3,1,ff+2 - Standard juggle off the Snake Sweep
   - b+4,f+4,3,4 - Only works on crouching opponents and after low parries
   
Guaranteed stuff - While these aren't juggles, the followups after the moves are
                  guaranteed.  Here they are:

Walls - With the addition of walls, Tekken has taken an interesting twist.  
       Punishing your cornered opponent seems to be the focus of this Tekken.
       Catching somebody beside a wall or structured object can be so much fun.
       Slamming them into one is even more fun.  Here are some useful moves given
       in certain situations:

   - (df+1,1,1,1,2) - Guaranteed after pushing your opponent into a wall.
   - Snake's Edge (df+3) - It'll hit them while they're down or while standing.
   - Hammer Driver (1+2) - Tracks down wall techers.

*Final Words*

This FAQ wasn't that difficult to write, nor long.  I just took my Jin FAQ and
added Bryan and his moves plus a few adjustments.  Always feel free to write (email's 
at the top of the page) and you will receive credit for any worthwhile contributions. 
Yes, I know there's a lot of things missing. I rushed this to get it out there at least.

There should better be some readers out there who can beat me using Bryan. In the Tekken
Central, GameFAQs, Toronto_Tekken, Tekkenzaibatsu, or any Tekken related forums my screen
name is Mini King. If you're from Toronto and you know Avex or the rest of the Tekken Crew,
then they can tell you who I am. If I ever come across an establishment with this game,
I'll be there playing. Currently, my source for Tekken 4 has been on Campus Cove at York 
University. You'll know you're playing me since I'm the only guy who uses Craig Marduk.

I don't have internet access at home during the summer, so you may not get any replies
right away.

No FAQ in the world will substitute for experience. Go out and get some.
