PREFACE
The reason I wrote this FAQ is simple: King has been one of my most 
effective characters since the first Tekken. There are many schools of 
King. Myself, my King is super aggresive, focusing on Oki. This FAQ is 
create in this fashion. Sit back, read, study, and enjoy.........

FOOTNOTE: This is NOT a typo. This is an actual move. It's a very fast 
Cannonball Buster. I cannot tell you the exact porperties of this move as 
I only use this to escape HEAVY pressure. Most of the time, it ends up as 
a cancelled Cannball Buster. I will experiment with this move to find out 
everything about it.

MOVE ANALYSIS



Palm Attack   [h,h   6,15]	
King has one of the best 1,2's in the game. Fast, good reach 
and MAD frame advantage after it hits. On CH, mad damage. Use 
this shit. 



Jab Uppercut   [h,m   10,12]		
Just like 1,2, but more priority and slower. Use this string 
when your opponent is ducking like crazy. 1,2/2,1 are common 
ways to set up throws. 



Disgraceful Kick   [h   20]
This is your retaliation move. Violent knockdown on a clean 
hit and a rollback on CH. Use up close, the recovery is better. 



Head Spinner   [m,m   15,21]
One of King's power moves. guaranteed combo on hit. buffer a 
chicken at the end on reversal-happy players. Don't abuse, 
it's recovery is worse than in TTT. 
 


Hop Kick   [m   13]
Must use. One of his best juggle staters. Use u+4 to play it safe. 



Black Bomb   [m   28]
This move is still as good as it was in TTT. But don't try this 
too much, cuz it recovers pretty bad. But when it hits, it leaves 
your opponents in perfect position for a Capital Punishment.



Elbow Sting    [m,m   15,12]
The best string move King has. Guaranteed combo when df+1 hits. 
Abuse this shit, it corrects chronic duckers. It's also a nice 
set up for your throws. Learn to delay the Elbow Sting when it's 
blocked. Otherwise, Jin gets a free 2,4/Lee gets 1,2,4:4 if they 
block a non-delayed Elbow Sting. You don't wanna give away free 
damage, right???



People's Elbow   [M   21]
Use this for grounded opponents. You auto-recover after this, so you 
don't have to worry about staying on the floor, plus it leaves a 
nice block stagger. Use this to bait your opponents into a attack.



Toll Kick   [h   20]
This has the same uses as the Disgraceful Kick. I use this when I don't 
wanna end up with my back turned. The only difference between this and 
the Disgraceful Kick is the Toll Kick is more juggle-friendly. 



Leg Breaker   [L   21]
Use this. Good damage, fast recovery. It's a little slow, but if used 
right, you'll never get hit outta it. Don't abuse this, low parry will 
fuck you up. 



Lifting Elbow   [m   15]
His best juggle starter. Use this if you what the most damaging Shadow 
Lariat combos. Other than that, it has the same uses as the Hop Kick.



Crouching Uppercut   [m   20]
This juggles everytime. Fast but slow recovery. Use with caution.   



Capital Punishment  [m   35]
One of your best weapons when in wake-up games. Use it when your 
opponent back rolls too much. Has a nice block stagger in it too. 
After block, mix it up between a throw and Hopkick/df+1,2. 



Blind Kick   [m   25]
This move sucks now. Still gives a free u+2+4 on CH, but that's 
about the only time you receive and decent damage. It does pitiful 
damage when used in oki. Don't even bother tryin the JF 1+2 after.  



Shadow Lariat   [h   25]
This is your long-range punisher. Most of the time, King ends up 
in a wierd BK position when this hits. Either Shadow Step away or 
try to hit them with a BK+3 as they are getting up. If you get lucky, 
you can sneak in a side throw.



High Elbow Drop   [M   35]
This move is somewhat underrated by most King players. Like I mentioned 
before, this is a good move to use in a combo. Also, you can use the 
u+2+4 version to punish those who attack you foolishly. 



Rolling Sabat   [m   23]
Good strong mid. The space it puts between you and your opponent when 
it hits is useful in set ups. If they hold down to counter the stagger, 
a 1+4 is guaranteed. 



Deadly Boomerang   [h   54]
The strongest non-unblockable in the game. Safe on block. Hits high, 
but too much damage in this move for you not to try it.



Jumping Knee   [m   25]
Only mid move he has from the crouch dash. safe on block(barely.) 
Usually sends the opponent flying. Otherwise, it staggers the opponent. 
A Shining Wizard is good after this.



K's Flicker   [m   20]
Another uppercut. Knockdowns on hit and juggles on CH. Use when you 
want quick oki.
  


Stomach Smash   [L   6]
Use this from a distance. You'll gets more CH's that way. You can 
use a command throw after the stun, but it's just safer to stick 
with the multis afterward. 



Flying Cross Chop   [h   15]
Used primarily for set-ups. Blocked at the right distance, a throw 
is free. If blocked low, you're fucked. Other than that, it's a safe 
way to get closer to the opponent. 



Water Parting Chop   [h   30]
Use to stop pit-bulls. Has great priority. Don't get predictable with 
this, it'll be ducked. 



Arrow Elbow   [h   10]
A variation of the Black Arrow. Use it when your opponent is turtling 
as it turns your opponent on block. You can sneak in a side throw. on 
normal hit, it slightly stuns your opponent, so have a Giant Swing ready 
for them when they recover. Useful on pitbulls. 



Lay Off   [!   0] 
Used only for mind games. Perform this over and over again to shake your 
opponent when he see's he can't block it. Use this to your advantage. 



Rib Buster   [m   17]
Much like Yoshi's df+4. Fast and damaging. Plus, it spaces very well.
Use to create room. 



Frankensteiner   [M   15,35]
throws on clean hit. Use after a 2,1/wall push.



Low Jab Uppercut   [sm,m   5,15]
Best counter move. 8 frames, recovers decently. Low parry will kill you 
if abused.


Jaguar Straight   [h   20]
King's ONLY new move. Knockdowns on hit. Great for starting Wake-up games.  


Sneak Uppercut   [m   22]
Treat this as a SS Water Parting Chop/Rolling Sabat. Has exactly the 
same uses, so you know what to do. 



Neck Cutter Kick   [h   42]
useful in stopping throw attempts. Throw it out every now and then.  
       


Konvict Kick   [m   26]
King's deathfist, nuff said. On CH, chains into a throw.



Low Dropkick   [L   16]
Good move when not blocked. Block=your ass. after it hits, you can mix 
it up between a FC,df+1 and f,f+4. FC,df+1 will usually hit them. 
f,f+4 will hit them when they stand up to block low.



Running Exploder   [m   40]
Use this, it has a big block stagger. Best uses near a wall to force 
a mix-up between KND 3/4. If KND 4 hits=free wall stun. 


Exploder   [m   25]
Read above explanation. 



Shoulder Tackle   [m   40]
Best used in oki. Can also be used as a long range counter. Don't use 
it besides that.  


Knockout Punch   [h   30]
Don't use, it sucks. 



Knee Buster   [l   15]
His best low attack. Useful into training you topponent to duck for a 
1+2,1/d+2+4.


Diving Body Press   [M   30]
Use this move to punish those chronic liers. You can also use for a 
tech roll trap(uf+4, 1,2 f,f+2+3.) Although it doesn't stun like it 
did in TTT, it's very handy for forcing people to move while on the 
floor. Best used for those who lie to avoid rolling combos like d+3+4,2.   



Stagger Kicks(to Spinning Uppercut)  [L,L,L_m   17,7,7_10]
Primarily use for wake-up games. Hits grounded and rolling opponents. 
You can also chip away health with this if your opponent never blocks 
low. 


Kick Reversal   [h+m   varies]
Use whenever gets predictable. I'm sure a d+1+2 is guaranteed afterwards. 
The JF 3+4 can only be done after a right kick reversal.

 

Jaguar Lariat   [h!   50]
A quick and powerful closeline to the throat. use every now and then. 
After it hits, you can use a ground throw. 



Atomic Blaster   [h!   50]
Use as a surprise move. I use when my opponent expects me to shadowstep 
only to run into an unblockable. 



Burning Double Knuckle   [!   45]
Surprise move. Otherwise, it has no useful purposes. 



Moonsault Body Press   [!   25_30]
Used in oki. No other useful purpose.

WHAT THROWS TO USE
------------------


This is by far, his best department. Not only does he have the most 
throws, but also have the most damaging! This section is entirely 
devoted to what throws to use when to opportunity shows itself. 
Every throw has a purpose. While some throws may not be great 
damage-wise, they may be a great way to play some OB/wake-up games. 




==============
|BASIC THROWS|
==============


Throw Name        Damage      Command     Escape
----------        ------      -------     ------


Suplex              35          2+4          2
Just a normal suplex. Recovers decently for some wake-up games. 



Winding Nut         35         f+2+4         2			
Blah, another standard throw. Your opponent is at the perfect 
distance for a Capital Punishment after this. If they even flinch, 
they're slammed hard into the floor. Best used outta FC.


Tomb Drop           35     (2+4_f+2+4)~B     2 
Best outta the standard throws. Puts you in great position for wake-up 
games. You can Stagger Kick for guaranteed damage. Also useful when 
mixing it up with Shining Wizard. 



Shining Wizard      30     (RN_f,f,f)+2+4    2
King's best throw, bar none. Not only does it look cool as shit, 
but it's great for those pesky wall techers. Tracks very well for 
a throw. Great Oki afterwards. Best throw for the throw/mid mix up.  



Argetina Backbreaker     40     right side, any throw     1
King grabs his opponent and slams 'em into his shoulders, breaking 
their back. They're stunned long enough afterwards to land a free 
High Elbow Drop, but you must be quick. Even though its a one button 
escape, these will not be escaped as often, due to the surprise 
factor of side throws. 



Knee Crusher        42	  left side, any throw     2
King lifts his opponent and slams their knee into his. Guaranteed 
ground throw afterward, but you have to dash in a bit. King's side 
throws are far more useful, due to their follow-ups. 



Half Boston Crab    60	    back, 2+4     none
Back throw. What else to say???


Cobra Twist	        60      back, f+2+4     none
Same as above. 



Stretch Buster      75	    back, b,f+1+2	     none
you'll hardly ever use this one since a BK+3 on a BK opponent is 
no longer guaranteed. Bust it out whenever you can. 



==============
|FRONT THROWS|
==============


Throw Name        Damage      Command     Escape
----------        ------      -------     ------



Punch String Throws
Use them whenever you opponent blocks too much.



Figure Four Leg Lock     32     db+1+2     1+2
Shitty damage, great position afterwards. If they reverse, it's 
only 26 points. Big deal.



Knee Bash       30       df+2+3      2
An even better choice for Oki options. This where you can use 
all of King's wake-up game. 

	

Muscle Buster     50      d,db,b+1+2      1+2
Easy motion, 50 pts, double-button escape. Use it. 



Rock Bottom      55     FC,db,d,db+1+2    1+2
Use it after ducking a high. The buffer makes it very easy to 
use when standing. If your opponent like to stand up afterwards, 
reward them with a GS/f+1+2*.   



Tombstone Piledriver     58       db,F+2       2
Another throw you must use. This throw has a tiny bit of "slop" to it, 
meaning you can walk a tad before executing the throw. Great mix up 
with the Muscle Bomber, as the break is different. But now, nothing is 
guaranteed except a Stagger Kick(unlike in the previous Tekkens, a 
Shoulder Cracker was guaranteed.) All in all, it's still a great throw.



Giant Swing	       70     f,b,db,d,df,f+1	      1
Use it. 



Frankensteiner          45           df+3+4           none
Used to break down block defense. Also help in switching sides 
when you're back is to the wall.  


Pile Diver              25          d,df,f+1           1
     =Face Buster       30             1+2            3+4
     =Boston Crab       50         1+2,3,4,1+2        3+4

This would be a good throw, but any attempt to land this throw will be 
wiped out since the Pile Driver has like a bazillion frame escape 
window. Sometimes this comes out instead of the Giant Swing on poor 
arcades. In the event that this accidentally comes out(it even happens 
to me), it's wise to know what to do. Pressing 1+2 will only increase 
the damage by 5 pts. However, the Boston Crab doubles it. Input the 
command for the Boston Crab at the very apex of the throw(and quick, 
too.) Like I said before, this can be escaped by pressing 3+4 during 
the throw. So, unless it's an accident, stay clear from this.

     =Jaguar Driver             60        1+2,u,d,N,3+4     3+4

Great throws, but the Stomach Smash needs to be a CH to work. Always go 
for the Jaguar Driver(if you're going for the links.) Most people don't 
know its escape. Its a cinch to do, just make sure your at neutral 
before pressing 3+4(don't worry, there's plenty of time to input the 
throw.)

     =Throw Away Knockdown       8              2+4          2

One of King's better links, I think. The links must be inputted at the 
very beginning of the throw, EXCEPT for the Turn Around, which is done 
at the very end of the throw. All of the links are useful. Turn around 
is great for Stagger Kicks. Feint is great for setting up an multi. 
Destroy gives a free High Elbow Drop. Knockdown gives a free People's 
Elbow/Shoulder Cracker. Use can use the Leg Breaker to mix it up with 
the guaranteed stuff for some fear/confussion tactics.

Great on turtlers who just stand and block everything. This is your 
"Icebreaker" move. This move will put the crack in your enemy's armor. 
Other than that, it too slow for any real use. Keep the surprise level 
high with this and it will connect often.

The most used throws are in this position. Primarily, you will use the 
Swing Away and the Shoulder Cracker. Swing Away just looks so damn cool, 
and the Shoulder Cracker has SO many setups. And the best thing about 
the Shoulder Cracker is after landing it, you have a free People's Elbow. 
Use the Turn Over whenever you can. If you ever land a Turn Over, another 
ground throw is guaranteed, but you must be quick. These ground throws have 
the most set-ups, so you can land these often. One note of caution, NEVER 
attempt Turn Overs on smaller framed people like Ling. They will NEVER connect.

My personal favorite throw chain. Major damage anyway you go. Confuse 
your opponents by going into a different link every time, as each link 
has a different break. BTW, any escape will do 10 pt of damage to King. 
Personally, I go for the Indian Death Lock. Double button escape, 'nuff 
said. Mashers cannot break this at all. To make thing worst for your 
opponent, it links into a unescapable throw.

I use it 50/50 with the Standing Heel Hold. I always go for Chicken 
Wing. Double button escape and the EASIST link to land. To land this 
100% of the time, input it like this: press 2. While holding 2, press 1. 
While holding 1+2, press 3. There you have it, guaranteed execution. 
This leads to the most devastating link in the game, the Rolling Death 
Cradle. That 75 pts of damage is glaring you straight in the face, but 
I would never attempt this. Even with button buffering, it's a bitch to 
do. Mashing it out will just give it away. Just go for Dragon Sleeper.   
If offers better oki afterwards.

If you use the SS version, cancel it a lot into WS attacks. This 
will force your opponent to stand. Then you an sneak a throw in. 
Seriously, you'll land this multi off low parries more than from 
the df+1+2/ss+1+2 version.

DON'T EVER YOU THIS CHAIN! AVOID IT AT ALL COST!! Even though this chain 
has King's strongest throw link(the Black Widow link=>130 pts), try this 
on me and I'll cut it short, scrub. Sorry to burst your bubble, kido, 
but there is a 100% escape to this. Yeah, yeah, I'm opening my big mouth 
and letting everyone know(who doesn't know already) how to escape this. 
Starting the chain requires either a 1+3_2+4. The escapes of the throw 
at this point are the same as the escapes of the basic throws(i. e. 1+3 
can be escaped with 1 and 2+4 can be escaped with 2.) If the throw is 
successful and the Reverse Arm Slam connects, the escape is THE OTHER 
PUNCH BUTTON! An example would be: your opponent starts the Reverse Arm 
Slam with 1+3. The escape is 1, but you begin to press 2 as fast as 
possible. The throw will connect and you will receive 25 pts of damage. 
However, by reading my FAQ, you know that the next throw can be escape 
by pressing 1. You start pressing 1 and you escape with your life. In 
other words, if you start mashing 1 or 2 to escape but it doesn't work, 
mash the other punch button to escape the next throw. Don't think that 
you're smart and stop the chain after the slam, cuz I know what you will 
try. Given the best scenario, the best damage you'll get is 35 pts. All 
that trouble for 35 pts. You could have done a basic throw and got more 
damage than this. This is the most obvious throw chain there is, please 
don't use it!!!      









=======================================================================
OFFENSE
=======================================================================

I could give you all my set ups that I have created/aquired since the 
last FAQ, but that would make this too long. Plus, checking out the King 
thread on TZ would do a better job than I would. Anyways, I don't want 
every who reads this to play like me..0_0



THROW BUFFERS
Learn them. If you don't use them, your King won't be anywhere. They're 
the fastest way to execute a throw.  
iSW=f,f,f+2+4
GS=input f during move, finish GS after move.
TS=d,db,b,F+2. You can walk a little forward before the 2.
RB=d,db,b,d,DB+1+2. Crouch for a split second then BAM!!! 




Landing those damn multi throws
-------------------------------
Before you attempt even trying to use multi throws, you must know how to 
button buffer! Also, know all the escapes for ALL the links! What is 
Button Buffering? Holding down a button to allow the next button press 
to be easier. Sorry if I confused with that explanation, but that's what 
it does. Let me give you an example. You jab by pressing 1. After a jab, 
you would like to use a position change, which is done by pressing 1+3. 
You can do the traditional method by pressing 1, 1+3. But with Button 
Buffering, you can do the same thing, but easier by doing this: press 1 
to jab, hold down 1 and press 3. Your throw will come out. Since you know 
the escapes, you can trick your opponents into doing the wrong escape by 
switching up your links. Knowing this vital information will ensure success 
in lading the multithrows! 



HOW TO BEAT THE "ESCAPERS"
To tell you the truth, you will hardly find people you will constantly escape 
your multi throws. Anytime you land a multithrow, they will start hitting those 
buttons like an Cristie player!! But sometime during your playing, you'll will 
play someone like me you watches your hands during multithrows and I'll escape 
every time. You can do three things to counter this:

1. Multi Throw Feint
Simply put, you're confusing the opponent by inputting more than one 
throw command. An example would be: during the Arm Breaker, you press 
1+2,1+2,4,2+4. You can tell that I've combined the input of the Triple 
Arm Breaker and the Head Jammer. If your opponent saw this, they would 
be confused as to what escape to use. No matter what you do, the game 
will land the first successful throw input. So the Triple Arm Breaker 
would be the throw performed. If your opponent knows this too, then you 
can confuse them even more. Another example would be: during the Cannonball 
Buster, you want the Manhanthan Drop to connect. To make sure it connects, 
you press {1},2,3+4,1+2,1+2+4. See the special notation? You purposely missed 
the 1 input by faking the press(looks like you press it, but finger went off 
of the button.) So your opponent will start the escape for the Power Bomb, 
thinking that's what you put, but instead they get a big knee between the legs. 
Another example would be: After a Victory Bomb, you can either link into a Giant 
Swing or Muscle Buster. Wanting to land the Giant Swing, you can input it like 
this: 3,1,2,1,3,4. If your opponent was watching your hands, they would have 
started the escape for the Muscle Bomber since the first three button presses 
belonged to the Muscle Bomber command. Instead, they get spinned for stupidity. 
And to make your opponent red in the face, you can throw in other commands that 
doesn't even belong in that chain!! Most likely, as soon as any link connects, 
their eyes will automatically go to your hands, not even paying attention to 
what chain you're starting. I love doing this to people who watch my hands all 
the time. An example would be: I start with the Standing Heel Hold. My opponent 
start watching my hands, not even caring what crouch dash link I started. My goal 
is to land the Indian Death Lock. So I would put in something like this: 
1+2,4,2+4,1+2,1+2,1,3,1+2. As soon as they see the input for the Head Jammer, 
my opponent will start pressing 2 to escape the Head Jammer. Instead, I chain into 
a unescapeable link and clown my opponent for being a complete jackass. The only 
problem with this is sometimes you will feint a throw and land a throw with the same 
escape. Taking the previous example, if I had put the command for the Chicken Wing 
instead of the Head Jammer, my opponent would have escaped, cuz the Chickenwing and 
Indian share the same escape. Practice this to ensure a correct feint. 

2. Cut the chain short
Keep it simple, don't go any farther in the chain where your opponent 
can escape. This works extremely well with the Reverse Special Bomb, as 
it has certain points in it you cannot escape. Also, you can stop the 
chain so you can get some guaranteed hits/throws after a throw. A great 
example would be using the Reverse Arm Slam. Since you're opponent can 
escape 100% after the first throw, you can simply land the slam and stop there. 
It puts you in excellent position for a Shoulder Cracker.  You get the idea. 
Just experiment what links give the best opportunities for wake-up games. 
    
3. Don't let your opponent see what your doing!!!!!!!!
By far, the most effective and dishonorable way to land a multi. I do 
this on cheap bastards that think they're the baddest mutherfuckers on 
Tekken. To do this subtlely, turn your shoulder that is toward your 
opponent. Your shoulder will be in way of your opponent, clearly giving 
you the advantage. Block off your opponent's view to land the multi throw. 
Best way to do this is use one of your hands to cover your other hand from 
your opponent's eyes.  





The almighty crouch dash
------------------------
f,N,d,df. Use it. King has one of the most versatile crouch 
dashes in the game. Kings has many moves to his calling during a crouch dash. A normal 
crouch dash yields his multi starters, Ultimate Tackle, Black Bomb, Capital Punishment, 
and Jumping Knee. A buffered f,f can lead into a Jaguar Straight, K's Flicker, Stomach 
Smash, Konvict Kick, Flying Cross Chop, Lay Off, and Diving Body Press. A WS buffer 
has no official moves, but you can execute a WS+4(which is excellent for GS.) Did I 
mention that you can Hop Kick during a crouch dash? With all of these moves, you can 
have you opponent shitting bricks whenever you go into a crouch dash. Even better, 
pressing f,N,d,df,N,f returns you to standing position, allowing access to almost 
all of King's moves. Mix it up often from a CD. 





Wall Offense
------------
King near a wall=ownage. Of course, when King is near a wall, you can play him 
ala Jin style. But that's not how I play. All you need is 3 moves: df+3+4, 
df,df+2+4, and f+1+2*. Wall push into a df+3+4/f+1+2* is extremely affective. 
When they duck, df,df+2+4 leads to multi. Whenever you get a wall stun, 
f+1+2/f+2+3/f,f+2+3 is great. If they tech roll the f+1+2, 1+4 is guaranteed. 
f+2+3 is great for damage, but somewhat risky if your opponent wall techs. 
f,f+2+3 just looks nice. You can use df+1 after a wall stun to knock them 
down for some wake-up games. Also, If your in a juggle and your opponent is 
about to hit the wall, you can time a throw perfectly to grab them off the 
wall(can you say GS????)  Here's what's guranteed off wall pushes:

close
  1,2/2,1
  db+1,db+1


far
  uf+4
  1+2,1
  b+3


Wake-up Games
-------------
To keep it simple, I'll divide this into four sections.   

Tech rollers:
easiest to beat. You can let them tech roll as throw them as soon as they rise. 
f,f+2+3 beats it everytime. A well time d+2+4/df,df+2+4 will snatch them outta 
tech roll EVERYTIME if timed correctly.

Back Rollers:
uf+1+2/d+3+4,2/f+2+3 work the best here. back roll recovers FC, so you can chase 
them down for a d+2+4. 

Attackers:
Make them whiff for big time damage. you can reverse the mid/ankle kick. If you 
parry any low kick, d+2+4 is guaranteed. 

Side rollers:
1+4/f,f+2+3/ground throws work the best here.
