    Christina :x:p*:D (plus everything ;D).

Khai, Tri, Leah, Megan
  - My two brothers and sisters who have always been there for me.  Thanks
    to Khai for giving me a copy of the beta version of Tekken 4 to practice
    before it came out and for also getting me the pre-release U.S. copy of
    Tekken 4 and for being my sensei in Tekken, you've shown me everything
    I have learned in Tekken.  Tri, my other brother, thanks for all the 
    times we had and will have.  Thanks to my sister Leah who's always been 
    there for me when I needed her the most, and her cooking :).  And Megan, 
    my only little sister, I'm proud of everything you've done, and I'll 
    always be here for you if you need me.

Taloney Aryah
  - First of all, I'd like to thank one of my childhood friends here, we've
    been playing Tekken since day one.  Gave me a few combos to add to this
    faq, and one of the top Mishima players local here.

Jerome Goudy
  - One of my other close childhood friends here, gave me a few combos with
    Kazuya.

    for my future faqs to come) and the credits section.  He truly has 
    contributed a lot of faqs to gamefaqs, and he will be missed on those
    pages.

http://www.namcoarcade.com/
  - Namco's official site for their games, they have a Tekken guide, and they
    even have avatars to go along with the characters.  Check this site out,
    it's worth it.

http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/
  - A non-official Tekken site, but it's one of the best out there for Tekken
    related material, I used their Jin Kazama movelist, and their combos, and
    videos to so they get some due credit for being apart of this faq too.

Kent Dela Pena                                <diamond_dela_pena@hotmail.com>
  - Some Jin info for his mix-up. His faq is great for those newbie's to 
    Tekken.

    Jin guide.

  - Contributed some very good info, including a few setup games with the
    1,2,3, d+4 combo, a tip on how to stop scrubs, a strategy with the Needle
    Shrine links, and a nice wall combo tip.

  - I used his info in the terms section to help with mine, thank you for the
    info.

 Version 0.1  [may 30, 2002] (thu.)
  - Jin faq was created today, added a lot of information on Jin: background 
    history, personal data, endings, etc.  His movelist both short and de-
    tailed versions have been filled out, did a few dry-runs and added some
    more information about his moves.

 Version 0.2  [june 12, 2002] (wed.)
  - I've completed the whole Special Arts section both short and in-depth.
    Now all I have to do is to list a lot of combos, which I'll need to 
    work on and also I'll list the strategies for the characters such as:
    vs. strategies against the CPU and against human players.  And I'll
    be updating the terms section soon.

 Version 0.3  [june 20, 2002] (thu.)
  - Fixed some typos, such as my middle name, I must of been typing to fast
    or something, because I accidentally put "Maikikou" whereas my middle 
    name is spelled "Mailikou".  Hope you see this CJayC.  Well as for the 
    updates, I've added some strategies against two characters, including
    Jin, and Hwoarang.  Also updated the combos section.  I plan to have the
    vs. strategy section finished within the next three versions.

 Version 0.4  [july 08, 2002] (sun.)
  - It has been a while since I have updated the faq, I went to a family 
    reunion in Atlanta, Georgia.  Well I'm back now so that gives me time
    to work on the faq, I've written down a lot of notes on the vs. character
    section, and plus I add some new combos also.  Received some info from
    Ben Thayer, appreciate it, I'll be sure to add the info.  And added a 
    "submitted info" section near the end of the faq.

 Version 0.5  [july 13, 2002] (sat.)
  - I've added a few more combos to the combo list, and I have changed a few
    typos in his combo,  also add some info against Hwoarang.  I plan to 
    release a combo video soon, so watch out for that, I'll also give you
    updates on that to.

 Version 0.6  [july 15, 2002] (mon.)
  - I've been working on the terms section and plan to add more to it, also 
    thanks to BMW for his info as i had a hard time defining the words 
    although i knew what they meant.  Also plan to classify combos later.

 Version 0.7  [july 20, 2002] (sat.)
  - I've finished revamping the combo section, so it'll be easier to read the
    combos now, and plan to add more in the future, I also plan to add more
    vs. info.  Fixed a few typo errors, and also changed a few formats.

 Version 0.8  [july 21, 2002] (sun.)
  - Fixed some more typos and added a few combos, plus I plan to add
    an infinite I found with Jin, but I want to make sure before I put
    it in the faq.

 Version 0.9  [july 24, 2002] (wed.)
  - Fixed some more typos, I plan to add the Jin infinite, also changed
    a few dividers in the movelist section.  I have finished the video
    but I need to find a place to host it or put it up.

 Version 1.0  [july 26, 2002] (fri.)
  - I haven't got any sleep lately, been up for 2 straight days, I added
    the definitions for the frame data, so you readers that don't under-
    stand the chart that I plan to add, just look for the frame database
    definitions, and also found out some more strategies against other
    players.

 Version 1.1  [august 09, 2002] (fri.)
  - So sorry I haven't worked on the faq lately people, I had a ton of things
    going on and I'm moving pretty soon, so if I don't update in at least two
    weeks, then that means either I don't have my computer hooked up, or I
    am not able to connect to the net.  But I add a extra note, and thanks to
    Sarchithanandan Korisatan for reminding me, sorry about the mistake on
    how to perform the Lingering Soul.

 Version 1.2  [august 18, 2002] (sun.)
  - Added JF Throat Smash after reading Arcadia's Tekken 4 guide, it's a good
    book to pick up if you want to know a few things about tekken.  I'll have
    the VS section completed by the next update, and I also added Shotokan's
    Jin Act.1 video and transcript (in order).

 Version 1.3  [september 09, 2002] (mon.)
  - Added some credits, and thanks to Shotokan once again for reminding me.

 Version 1.4  [october 11, 2002] (fri.)
  - Edited some combo damages, recorrected a few errors in the combos, added
    some extra infos and had some of the moves mixed up, so I had to also
    recorrect that.  I'm also working excessively to put the frame data in,
    which should be in by the next update, I'll have a simple chart layed out
    so it will be easy for you readers to read the chart.

 Version 1.5  [november 01, 2002] (fri.)
 - Instead of putting the frame data separately, I decided to put them under
   their respectful move, it makes it much easier to read all of the move's
   information and its properties, instead of dividing them all up into
   different sections.  Also added a few moves to the detailed list, seeing
   as I accidently left some out, and also revised a few sections of the 
   faq.

 Version 1.6  [december 12, 2002] (wed.)
 - I updated a few more combos, and I'm almost done with the VS strategies
   section, I'll add the remaining info when I can, seeing as tomorrow is
   my birthday, I'll be out of town for a while, so if I don't update soon,
   then excuse me, because I'll stil be out of town.

 Version 1.7  [january 15, 2003] (wed.)
 - Its been a while but I'm back, I just fixed a few typos and a couple of
   other things, also congratulations to http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/ for
   their update to 4.0, looks great guys!  Keep up the work. 

 Version 1.8  [april 21, 2003] (mon.)
 - Man...I haven't worked on this faq in forever, sorry people, I've been
   extremely busy moving and stuff (I live in Amelia, Ohio now >.<).  I'm
   going add information on Jin and add a transcript for Jin's other movies
   that I have heard.  Sorry for the lack of updates people.

 Version 1.9  [may 01, 2003] (thu.)
 - Added Shatokan's second Jin combo movie.  Also updated some of the move
   information such as the frame rates and filled in any missing spots.
   Apparently I need to get unformation on a couple of Jin's move, which I
   don't have the frame information for, so it might take me a while.

 Version 2.0  [may 31, 2003] (sat.)
 - Updated more frame information, and also added more additional versus
   information.

 Version 2.1 [june 12, 2004] (sat.)
 - Haven't updated in over a year due to school and other miscellaneous
   events.  Changed my email address and contributor name, and I decided
   to use my Vietnamese name in my future faqs.  Also plan to add a lot more 
   information into this faq, as it's almost complete.  Also do expect a
   Tekken 5 Jin faq from me to.  More to come in my next update.

 Two years ago, Heihachi failed to capture Ogre.

 Not willing to give up, Heihachi ordered his researchers to collect blood 
 samples, skin tissue, and hoof fragments left behind by Ogre (or known as 
 True Ogre in its true manifestation) in order to conduct genetic 
 experiments.  Heihachis goal was to create a new life form by splicing 
 Ogres genome with his own.  However, the research was unsuccessful.

 After extensive experimentation, Heihachis bioengineers came to the 
 conclusion that an additional gene - the Devil Gene - was necessary in order 
 to successfully splice Ogres genetic code into another living organism. 
 Heihachi learned that his own genome lacked the Devil Gene, but he knew 
 someone who did...

 Jin Kazama.

 Jin, who vanquished Ogre in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, was shot and 
 mortally wounded by Heihachi.  As his life slipped away, Jin transformed 
 into a Devil.  Upon his transformation, he struck down Heihachi and took  
 flight.

 Jins whereabouts were unknown after the Tournament.

 Heihachi searched for Jin to no avail.  However, Heihachi discovered a 
 photograph during his investigation that stirred his curiosity.  The 20- 
 year-old photograph was an image of a burnt corpse covered with laceration 
 wounds.  Heihachi paid particular attention to the corpses back, which had 
 what looked like deformed, protruding wing-like limbs.


 Convinced that the picture was of Kazuya, his own son whom he threw into a 
 volcano 20 years ago, Heihachi diverted all his resources into a search for 
 the body.  This search eventually led Heihachi to G Corporation, a leading-
 edge biotech firm making unprecedented advances in the field of biogenetics 
 research.

 Heihachi discovered that G Corporation found the corpse and extracted and 
 analyzed its genetic data.  In fact, Heihachi learned that the company was
 in the midst of creating a new life form by using the data.  Heihachi also 
 determined that Kazuyas remains and research data were secured at G 
 Corporations Nebraska and Nepal research laboratories, respectively.

 Friday of 25 December.  The Tekken Force raided G Corporations maximum 
 security research laboratory in Nepal.  The bottom floors of the building 
 were obliterated, and the remaining data storage facility containing file 
 servers was airlifted by a group of heavy-duty helicopters.

 At the same time, a separate unit led by Heihachi infiltrated the 
 underground research facility in Nebraska, where Kazuyas remains were 
 preserved.  As Heihachi observed from his helicopter, he soon realized that 
 unlike the Nepal facility, the operations in Nebraska were not going 
 according to plan.  The tactical status monitor screens showed the first 
 wave of the Tekken Force troops being blown out from the storage room where 
 Kazuyas remains were supposedly kept.

 A silhouette of a large figure slowly emerged from the room... When Heihachi 
 could see clearly enough, he instantly recognized the large figure as 
 Kazuya.

 Kazuya was resurrected in G Corporations research facility.  After his 
 resurrection, Kazuya offered his body as research material to determine the 
 true nature of the Devil that resided within him.  Kazuyas goal was to
 unify his two selves into one.  Kazuya theorized that if he unified his body 
 with the Devil, he would be able to truly harness its powers.  He could then 
 finally take revenge against Heihachi and the Mishima Zaibatsu (Financial 
 Empire).

 Enraged that Heihachi thwarted his plans, Kazuya obliterated the heavily 
 armed Tekken Force and vanished into the flames of the labs wreckage.

 Heihachi was infuriated by Kazuyas escape and took out his anger on his 
 hapless subordinates who reported the escape.

 Abel, Heihachis lead scientific advisor, urged the enraged Heihachi to 
 quickly find a way to capture Kazuya. Once his anger subsided, Heihachi 
 focused his mind and decided on a plan. An evil smile crept upon his lips.

 Two years had passed since The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3.

 The Mishima Zaibatsu announced The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 and placed 
 the massive financial empire as the top prize.

 The champion who manages to defeat Heihachi at the end of the Tournament
 would inherit the Mishima Zaibatsu.

 Well aware that the tournament is just a trap designed to lure him out,  
 Kazuya nevertheless enters - it is his chance to defeat Heihachi.

 First of all, this is my very first faq, so if any of you readers have 
 comments and/or suggestions, please send them in.  This faq has a few
 purposes: 1. To give you the info on Jin Kazama; 2. How to play with him;
 3. Give some nice tips on combos and such; and 4. How to get the best of
 Jin's latent power to come out.

 [ Tekken Reference of Terms ]  ---------------------------------------------

 
 ::GENERAL TERMS::

 000. ani (Move Animation) [animation]
    -  animation is the video output, measured in frames, that you see while 
       playing Tekken.  When I refer to the animation of maneuvers, I am 
       noting the moves 'startup', 'execution' and 'recovery' animation, each 
       of which is very important.  These animations can be measured in 
       frames, or 1/60th fractions of a second.  Startup, execution and 
       recovery are described below.

 001. exe (Move Execution) [execution]
    -  the animation (time) during which the most active properties of an 
       attack or maneuver take place.  The execution of Jin's ub+1+2 would be 
       the time during which his fist may connect against an opponent.

 002. rec (Recovery Time) [recovery]
    -  the animation (time) during which the after-effects of a maneuver take
       place.  The recovery of Jin's ub+1+2 would be the time after the punch 
       might have connected, but before he may perform any other maneuver or 
       block.

 003. strt (Startup Animation) [startup]
    -  the animation(time) during which a character prepares to execute his 
       maneuver. The startup of Jin's ub+1+2 would be the time when ub+1+2 is 
       input during which he 'charges up' in preparation for his unblockable 
       attack.

 004. SS(L/R) (Axis Shift) [sidestep]
    -  In Tekken 4, you may complete an axis shift by performing a sidestep
       (which is basically a quick dash to the side).  If you tap up on the 
       controller, your character will move towards the background of the 
       arena(away from you), if you tap down, he will move towards the 
       foreground of the arena(closer to you).

 005. SSW (Sidestep Walk) [axis walk]
    -  In Tekken, you can continue to walk to the side (either left or right)
       by tapping and holding up or down.  If you tap and hold up on the 
       controller, your character will move towards the background and 
       continue to walk until you release up.  If you tap and hold down on 
       the controller, then your character will move towards the foreground
       and continue to walk until you release down.  This is very useful when
       you have to position yourself for a wall combo.

 006. buff (Buffer Technique) [buffering] 
    -  an aspect of Tekken game mechanics that allows you to enter in button 
       sequences more efficiently.  This is how it works: you want to enter 
       in a sequence consisting of button one and then button one and button  
       two together.  Normally, you would have to tap button one, release it,
       and then tap button one and button two at the same time.  Buffering is 
       the ability to PRESS AND HOLD button one(this is the key), and then 
       tap button two to register an input of both buttons.  In this way, you 
       can get the same result as before while being much more accurate in 
       the process.  NOTE: To complete any, and I do mean ANY, individual 
       move that requires you to press more than one button, you may press 
       and hold all but one of those buttons and then tap the last one when 
       you are ready to complete the move.  You can also use buffering to 
       smoothly cancel one move with another using a modified input sequence.

 007. cbn (Combination) [combo]
    -  a series of moves that are unblockable and inescapable, given that the 
       first move (in the series) connects.

 008. con (Connect) [unguarded]
    -  the result of an attack that is improperly guarded against, and the 
       most basic way an attack may hit an opponent.

 009. cnm (Counter Move) [counter]
    -  a move that negates an opponent's move or his recovery from a move. 
       Specific counter types are explained below.

 010. ARR (Attack Reversal Reversal) [chicken]
    -  a reversal reversal performed by inputing f+1+3 if a left limb is
       reversed or f+2+4 if a right limb is reversed.

 011. CH (Counter Hit) [interrupt]
    -  an attack that connects either while your opponent is attacking (major
       counter), or immediately after his attack while he is still recovering 
       from it(minor counter), thereby negating his attack or recovery.

 012. pry (Attack Parry) [parry]
    -  a sort of thrust-block that throws your opponents attack to the side,
       and staggers him for a brief period of time. In some situations a 
       parry allows for a combo by the parrier because of this staggering 
       effect.

 013. tch (Tech) [techable]
    -  a special type of counter that can only be used in special situations:
       a tech does not negate an attack as other counters do, but instead it 
       alters the outcome of the attack to the benefit of the player
       completing the tech.

 014. tchrol (Tech Roll Recover) [tech roll]
    -  a tech roll is a quick-recover roll you may perform after many 
       maneuvers, and it may be used to better your positioning. Any 
       character may tech-roll after landing face up from a juggle 
       combination by tapping 1_2 to roll towards the background of the 
       arena, or 3_4 to roll towards the foreground of the arena.

 015. rev (Reversable) [reversal]
    -  a special type of counterhit that attacks your opponent while he is 
       attempting to attack you.  You may counter reversals by performing
       a chicken.

 016. custrg (Custom String) [custom combo]
    -  a series of individual moves or portions of strings used to create a 
       move sequence that blends together so well it is difficult to defend 
       against or counter.

 017. fr (Frame Rates) [frames]
    -  the images that are shown to the viewer which make up the video output
       (animation) of a video game. Tekken 4 flashes 60 of these images
       (frames) every second. Note that fps stands for Frames Per Second.

 018. jug (Juggle Combo) [Juggles]
    -  a juggle is a series of moves used to hit an airborne opponent. 
       Attacks that are made upon an airborne opponent are effectively 
       unblockable.  Specific juggle types are explained below.

 019. bncjug (Bounce Juggle) [bounce starter]
    -  a type of juggle in which the juggled character bounces off of the 
       ground (example: Bryan's u/f+4).

 020. fltjug (Float Juggle) [float, floater] 
    -  a type of juggle in which the juggled character immediately falls 
       towards the ground after the juggle starter (example: any characters 
       grdt3).

 021. hghjug (High Juggle)
    -  a type of juggle in which the juggled character is launched 
       significantly higher than in a normal juggle (example: Hwoarang's
       f,N,d,d/f+4).

 022. nmljug (Normal Juggle)
    -  the most common type of juggle in which the juggled character is 
       launched upward (example: Jin's d/f+2).

 023. multhr (Multi Throw) [throw combo]
    -  a grappling move that may have an alternate outcome via input from the
       user.

 024. pokptrn (Poking Pattern) [poke]
    -  a continuous, repeated series of fast attacks that forces your 
       opponent into a defensive state (similar to, but not the same as a 
       custom string).

 025. stgr (Stagger Attack) [stagger hit]
    -  many attacks(most notably parries) stagger your opponent.  The 
       recovering positions after a staggering attack vary, but all staggers 
       make it impossible for a staggered character to block attacks for a 
       brief period of time. The are few differences between the technical 
       aspects of a staggering attack and a stunning attack (see 'stun').

 026. strg (String Combo) [string, move-string]
    -  a preselected set of moves that may be chained together to create a 
       single move sequence (not to be confused with a "combo").
 
 027. stn (Stun Attack) [stun]
    -  all attacks cause stun whether it is guard stun (which sometimes makes 
       it impossible to reverse or parry during attack strings) or connect
       stun (recovery).  When I talk about the stunning characteristics of a 
       move I mean to say that this move causes either a significantly longer 
       stun or that it has special stun properties such as Jin's b,f+2 on 
       major counter.  This move causes a stun in which your opponent doubles 
       over and slowly falls face-first onto the ground, allowing for 
       combinations.



 ::FRAME DATABASE::

 028. Command Column [input] 
    -  Pretty self explanatory, this is how you execute the listed move. The 
       directions are in relation to which way your character is facing of 
       course. 

 029. F Hit Column [F hit] {F}
    -  Indicates how many frames it takes for a move to hit after you have 
       finished the command. This does not included the number of frames it 
       takes to input the command. 

 030. B Adv Column [B adv] {B}
    -  The number of frame advantage or disadvantage when the move is 
       blocked. Meaning the amount of frames it takes before you can input a 
       new command. Positive numbers are advantages over your opponent, 
       negative numbers indicate a disadvantage and KD indicates the opponent 
       gets knocked down. This can either be a juggle, stun or any other kind 
       of knock down. 

 031. H Adv Column [H adv] {H}
    -  The number of frame advantage or disadvantage on a hit. Keep in mind a
       hit does not necessarily results in an advantage over the opponent. 
       Frame advantage on stagger moves reflects the amount of stagger 
       frames, this does not equal the number of frames your opponent cannot 
       block attacks. 

 032. Hc Adv Column [Hc adv] {Hc}
    -  The number of frame advantage or disadvantage on a hit when the 
       opponent is in a crouched position. Frame advantage on stagger moves 
       reflects the amount of stagger frames, this does not equal the number 
       of frames your opponent cannot block attacks. 

 033. CH Adv Column [CH adv] {CH}
    -  The number of frame advantage or disadvantage on a counter hit. Keep
       in mind a counter hit does not necessarily results in an advantage 
       over the opponent.

 NOTE: If you really want to master your favorite characters you should 
 definitely take a look at the frame information. You will instantly see what 
 are the bad moves to use and which moves would be prime retaliation options. 
 Tekken 4 runs at 60 frames per second.

 It is VERY IMPORTANT to note that sometimes you can block before you can 
 actually input a command, this is often the case with minor stuns and guard 
 breaks. Thus a -12 for example doesn't necessarily mean you can't block for 
 12 frames (After Jin's Kazama Fury for example you can block almost 
 instantly yet you cannot move for nearly half a second). Most moves with a 
 disadvantage of 8 or less can be considered safe moves as it takes at least 
 8 for your opponent to execute a standard jab and in some cases your 
 opponent will not even be within jab range and you have to add on whatever 
 amount of frames it take for him to dash within hitting range. Christie has 
 the ability to shorten recovery time after certain moves with a side step or 
 using recover crouching cancels.



::TYPES OF PLAYERS::

 034. Masher
    -  someone who doesn't really know how to play Tekken. They get on the
       game, pick a character, and then they attempt to win by hitting 
        the buttons and yanking on the joystick as fast as possible.

 035. Novice, Newbie (noob)
    -  someone who is familiar with basic Tekken tactics, but simply lacks 
       the knowledge to be proficient in it.

 036. Scrub
    -  someone who is good at doing one thing with one character, or repeats
       the same moves over again repetitively.

 037. Intermediate
    -  a WIDE range of players (basically anyone who doesn't fit into the 
       other categories).

 038. expert
    -  expert level players demand control of everything: their player, their 
       opponent's player, EVERYTHING: they achieve control over their own 
       character by practicing until they have him down to a science; and 
       they achieve control over their opponent's character by forcing him 
       into situations in which he has very limited choices, and then they 
       make an assumption as to which choice their opponent will make. Note 
       that an expert level player in one location may or may not be an 
       expert level player in another locale because the skill levels of the 
       two locations may be very different.



 ::TYPES OF TACTICS::

 039. poking [pokers, poking tactics] 
    -  the process of using very fast, usually low-damage attacks to knock an 
       opponent out of his attack (very effective when used in conjunction 
       with "turtle" tactics). In high-level play, poking becomes a series of 
       fast moves that entices an opponent to make a mistake, therebye 
       allowing for a high-damage counterattack (like df+2, for example).

 040. pit bull [pit bull tactics]
    -  a "pit bull" is a player who gets right up in your face and attacks, 
       and attacks, and attacks (basically a poker who doesn't ever let up).

 041. turtle [turtle tactics, turtler]
    -  a strategy that involves waiting for the best time to attack by 
       avoiding and/or your opponent's attacks until he leaves himself open 
       to your attack.


 

 NOTE:  WILL BE REVISED IN THE NEXT FEW UPDATES :)

 Here is where you'll find all the conventions and explanations to them, but 
 apparently I have to find some time to work on the definitions, so just give 
 me a few weeks.  Now some (if not all) of you readers are probably thinking 
 I took the alpha, beta, gamma idea from Marvel vs Capcom 2, but I didn't, 
 trust me.  I studied the Greek alphabet last year and so I thought if this 
 could be my own little "style" to when I type future faqs from now on.  The 
 alpha section is the short version of the move list. This is where you want 
 to go to find all of Jin's moves the easy, fast, and reliable way.  The beta
 section is where I break down the moves and explain how to use each move,
 or I might just give you readers a combo or to.  The gamma section is where 
 I list all the combos, custom combos, and the mix/wake-up games.  If another 
 one of my faqs ever get into gameFAQs, you'll have to check here to see what 
 I listed as Alpha, Beta, and Gamma.  So on with the faq!  

 a - "alpha" section (short version of movelist)
 b - "beta" section (detailed version (in-depth) movelist)
 g - "gamma" section (combos and custom combos and mix/wake-up games)

Example:  move properties / hit range / damage

 Twin Thrusts - -- / hh / 7,12
 input » 1,2    H adv  » +9,+9
 F hit » 10     Hc adv » --,--
 B adv » +2,+1  CH adv » +9,+10

  - One of Jin's better moves to poke with, and you can string this together 
    with the 1,2,3_4.  This is a move that you want to mix-up with, it'll 
    keep the opponent guessing what you plan to do.  One of my strategies is 
    to use the 1,2 a few times, then mix it with the 3 and 4.  If your 
    opponent catches onto this pattern, use the uf+1+2 throw, it's cancelable 
    (thanks to Kent Dela Pena for this information), oh, and don't abuse this 
    move unless you plan to play a second-rate Jin (e.g. playing a cheese or 
    cheap Jin).

 Twin Thrusts to Inner Axe - GB, JB / hhm / 7,12,25
 input » 1,2,3     H adv  » +9,+9,KD
 F hit » 10        Hc adv » --,--,KD
 B adv » +2,+1,+3  CH adv » +9,+10,KD

  - Mix this up with the Twin Thrusts, if you connect with the Inner Axe at 
    the end, use a Demon Sweep to get deal some damage, or use another Twin 
    Thrusts to Inner Axe combo if you can execute it early enough.  I usually 
    follow this up with a Demon Lift kick, then a Twisting Demon Scissors.
    It also causes the opponent to have a guard break, if you are quick 
    enough, use the Throat Smash throw (uf+1+2) just to surprise them.
    1,2,3 gives you an ungodly frame advantage following up with a needle 
    Shrine series is hard to stop (certified scrub killer and a decent setup 
    for high level playing) (from Ben Thayer).

 Twin Thrusts to Roundhouse - GB / hhh / 7,12,22
 input » 1,2>4    H adv  » +9,+9,KD
 F hit » 10       Hc adv » --,--,--
 B adv » +2,+1,0  CH adv » +9,+10,KD

  - Most players (beginners) tend to use this often, when using this, try not 
    to overuse this move, more skilled players will either parry, duck, or 
    reverse this move.  If the opposing player ducks the Roundhouse, you'll 
    be setup for some combos or some okizemes.  When you do connect with this 
    kick, it'll give you some breathing space and you could either run to you 
    opponent them slide kick him/her, use a Twisting Demon Scissors, or use a 
    Demon Sweep.

 Kazama Fury - HS / hhmml / 7,10,10,10,10
 Input » 1,3,2,1,4       H adv  » +9,+4,+3,+3,+24
 F hit » 10              Hc adv » --,--,+3,+3,+24
 B adv » +2,-6,-1,-4,-8  CH adv » +9,+4,+3,+3,+24

  - Yes, Jin's signature five hit combo, a single straight snap jab, one snap 
    kick, two body hooks, and a low ankle kick to stun the opponent.  I use 
    this move at least once every match just in case if I get lucky or if 
    it's a newbie on the machine who doesn't know how to block it.  When you 
    connect the low kick, use a Demon Lift Kick for a juggle setup, a throw 
    if you want some damage, or another Kazama Fury.  I use the Hell Gate 
    Kick because it deals some good damage and knocks the opponent back.  If 
    you want to do the Lingering Soul cancel, that's alright too, but be 
    careful for it's lag time.
 
 Lead Thrust to Jaw Kick - -- / hh / 7,13
 Input » 1,3    H adv  » +9,+4
 F hit » 10     Hc adv » --,--
 B adv » +2,-6  CH adv » +9,+4

  - It's a nice looking move, but it's time between the punch and kick is 
    slow, I'd rather you use this move in juggles, but this is the section 
    where I help you readers out.  Well, if you can get the Twin Thrusts to 
    Inner Axe to connect, then just use this after for some damage.  Oh yeah 
    did I mention it's good to mix this up with the Vertical Kick and Blade 
    Kick.  If you play against somebody who can reverse kicks (King or Paul 
    in particular), don't use this move to much, they'll just reverse one
    of the three kicks to come (that's if they know how to reverse, which 
    they should).
      
 Lead Thrust to Vertical Kick - GB / hm / 7,22
 Input » 1,3~3  H adv  » +9,KD
 F hit » 10     Hc adv » --,KD
 B adv » +2,+5  CH adv » +9,KD

  - The Vertical Kick basically cancels from the Jaw Kick, but anyway, the 
    kick guard breaks, that means you get some breathing space.  If you hit 
    your opponent into the wall with this kick, then follow up with a Demon 
    Hell Thrusts for some good damage, or a Rear Thrust to Roundhouse for 
    some damage. The Rear Thrust to Roundhouse also sets you up for wake-up 
    games, so keep that in mind.  Oh and try a Twisting Demon Scissors or a 
    Demon Sweep after to knock your opponent down to the ground for a hit.
    If you Follow up with the Blade Kick the opponent will be left in a 
    Crumple Fall Stun on a counter hit, a nice combo (but kind of difficult 
    to perform) would be crouch dash, then 4, then finish the combo with a 
    Twin Thrust to Inner Axe/Roundhouse or a Rear Thrust to Roundhouse.  The 
    command for the combo would be: f,N,d,d/f,f+4, [1], 1,2,3_1,2>4_2,4.  You 
    can cancel into the Lingering Soul if you like after the Blade Kick. Have 
    a 'chicken' buffered just in case if they try to reverse it.  Follow up
    with a d+4 if the Vertical Kick connects for more damage, as the d+4 is
    gauranteed.

 Lead Thrust to Blade Kick - CFSc, GS / hmm / 7,22,13
 Input » 1,3~3,3    H adv  » +9,KD,+1
 F hit » 10         Hc adv » --,KD,+1
 B adv » +2,+5,-12  CH adv » +9,KD,KD

  - Of the 3 variations that you can cancel into, the Blade Kick gives you
    the best opportunity to setup a floating combo; after his stun on CH,
    follow up with f,N,d,d/f,f+4, which Jin will do a quick thrusting kick
    forward, and it hits mid.  Mix this up between the three, stop sometimes
    between some of them so that you can switch to another move (a custom
    combo is what I'm talking about).  This custom combo : 1,3~3, b+4, d+1,
    WS+3 would be an example of a custom combo.  Try to develop different
    combo variations by stopping between the kicks to input another command.

 Mid Thrust to Side Crusher - -- / mm / 12,15
 Input » d/f+1>4  H adv  » +9,+2
 F hit » 13       Hc adv » +9,+2
 B adv » -2,-7    CH adv » +9,+2

  - This should be mixed up with the Twin Thrusts and with the Lancer.  A 
    good game to keep the opponent guessing high or low is to use the Shin 
    Kick when mixing up with the Mid Thrust.  I use this in some air combos, 
    such as a low juggle combo.  When you have a chance try to use this in 
    the combo mentioned above.  Note to have a 'chicken' buffered, 
    precautions are helpful.

 Mid Thrust to Shin kick -  / ml / 12,13
 Input » d/f+1,4~4  H adv  » +9,+2
 F hit » 13         Hc adv » +9,+2
 B adv » -2,-15     CH adv » +9,+2

  - The low kick at the end does little damage, but every hit counts right?  
    Try not to use this too much, otherwise it'll just get low parried, and 
    then you be open to attacks and such.  The lag time between the punch and 
    kick is noticeable, so avoid getting hit between the punch and kick.  
    Remember to have a 'chicken' buffered just in case.

 Rising Lancer -  / mm / 10,16
 Input » WS+1>2  H adv  » +5,+6
 F hit » 13      Hc adv » +5,+6
 B adv » -6,-5   CH adv » +5,+6

  - The old days of using this to poke, and the old command was a lot more 
    comfortable, but it gained a new attribute of being delayed.  If you 
    launch somebody up in the air, and want to just knock them out the air 
    then this is a good move to use to bring them down in front of you for a 
    Demon Sweep or Twisting Demon Scissors.  Another strategy is to use this 
    after ducking an opponent's attack, or as a poking game.  

 Thunder Hook Fist -  / m / 22
 Input » f,N,d,d/f+1  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 16           Hc adv » KD
 B adv » -7           CH adv » KD

  - A new Hook for Jin, while it doesn't serve as a juggle starter, it's 
    damage makes up for it.  It's best to use this for distancing yourself 
    from your opponent when you need to strategize a new gameplay.  Sometimes 
    you can land a Thunder Hook Fist at the beginning of a round right after 
    the announcer says "fight!"  I've been known to do this, but on a rare 
    notice.  It may seem weak, but people tend to underestimate it's
    potential.  I use this in juggles only when I'm near a wall, that way, 
    when it hits, my opponent will bounce of the wall and I get to land some 
    hits.  One more combo for you readers: [W!] b,f+2,1,d+2, [w!] 
    f,N,d,d/f+1 [w!], d/f+1,4.  It's best to perform the Thunder Hook Fist 
    really early so that the punch will connect when you perform the Mid 
    Thrust to Side Crusher.  Also if the wall is to the right of you (and
    your facing to the right; vice versa for if your facing left, you would
    use the Wind Hook Fist) you can use the Thunder Hook Fist to slam your
    opponent into the wall for some damage.

 Corpse Thrust -  / m / 24
 Input » d+1  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 21   Hc adv » KD
 B adv » -4   CH adv » KD

  - A previous move he has kept.  It hits mid, so if anybody tries to duck or 
    crouch it, they will be hit.  This move is good to use to duck high 
    attacks, but try not to use this to much, as it's lag time is huge, but 
    if you do hit, you'll get some breathing space.  I've used this as a 
    okizeme sometimes.  If you hit the opponent down and they try to roll, 
    use this to keep them grounded.  If you hit them against the wall, use a
    Demon Lift kick or a Demon Hell Thrusts to get some damage, or whatever
    you would like to use.

 Left Elbow -  / h / 14
 Input » b+1  H adv  » +7
 F hit » 13   Hc adv » +7
 B adv » 0    CH adv » +7

  - This I accidentally use sometimes, but it mostly hits.  If you guard a 
    string or attack that leaves the opponent close to you, use this to knock 
    them back a bit.  Follow this up with a Thunder Hook Fist or a Lead 
    Thrust to Vertical Kick, I know it may sound bad, but it helps keep the 
    opponent guessing what you'll do.

 Demon Hell Thrusts -  / hh / 10,21
 Input » 1+2  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 14   Hc adv » --
 B adv » -9   CH adv » KD

  - This move hits high, so it's safe to use this to knock your opponent back 
    when you want some room.  But if ducked, you'll be left wide open, and 
    that's a scenario you don't want to get yourself in.  Instead use this in 
    juggles and after a Blocked Twin Thrust to Inner Axe, it's fast enough to 
    hit.  Though the beginning has a bit of lag time, it's still safe to use.  
    Hit your opponent against the wall with this to setup a wall combo.  
    Follow up with a Demon Lift Kick, Demon Sweep, or Twisting Demon
    Scissors.
  
 Lancer -  / hm / 10,10
 Input » 2,1   H adv  » +9,+12
 F hit » 10    Hc adv » --,+12
 B adv » 0,+1  CH adv » +9,+12

  - An excellent tool for the mix-up games with the Twin Thrusts.  I usually 
    use this and the Twin Thrusts for the mix-up games, along with the Lancer 
    to Side Crusher/Shin Kick.  Try using this in some of your air combos, 
    for instance, use a 1,2,3, d/f+2, f,f, 2,1,4~4.  This will connect 
    sometimes, it's a good combo, but the only hard part to connect is the 2 
    in the Lancer's beginning part, but work on it and you'll be fine.

 Lancer to Side Crusher -  / hmm / 10,10,15
 Input » 2,1,4    H adv  » +9,+12,+2
 F hit » 10       Hc adv » --,+12,+2
 B adv » 0,+1,-7  CH adv » +9,+12,+2

  - I use this on a daily basis, as it serves for one of Jin's poking games, 
    although the frame rate is a bit slower than that of the Twin Thrusts 
    mix-ups, it still has it's purposes.  If the opponent tries to reverse 
    your kick, have a chicken buffered just for precautions.  The kick hits 
    mid, so if the opponent tries to duck, they'll be hit by the kick.

 Lancer to Shin Kick -  / hml / 10,10,13
 Input » 2,1,4~4   H adv  » +9,+12,+2
 F hit » 10        Hc adv » --,+12,+2
 B adv » 0,+1,-15  CH adv » +9,+12,+2

  - Okay, now for those who like to parry kicks in the arcade, this would be 
    a choice move to perform, as it can't be reversed, or parried (except for 
    the low parry), and you have a nice mix-up game with the Side Crusher and
    the Shin Kick, it'll confuse the opponent.  Try to use this in some low 
    hitting combos such as a WS+2, 2,1,4~4, it's best connect if you hit on a 
    counter hit.

 Rear Thrust to Roundhouse -  / hh / 10,14
 Input » 2,4    H adv  » +9,KD
 F hit » 10     Hc adv » --,--
 B adv » 0,-12  CH adv » +9,KD

  - Excellent guard breaker for those who like to play defensively.  If the 2 
    hits on a counter hit, the Roundhouse is foolproof to connect.  Also this
    move is Jin's best anti-SS move, as the Roundhouse also tracks sidesteps,
    so use this after a cancelled Needle Shrine when your opponent tries to
    sidestep the second hit of the series (from Ben Thayer).

 Final Upper Thrust -  / m / 15
 Input » WS+2  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 14    Hc adv » KD
 B adv » -12   CH adv » KD

  - This should be used after you have blocked a low attack, and if you're 
    quick enough, you'll launch your opponent in the air.  A good combo would
    be WS+2, b,f+2>1,2.  You'll have to delay the 1 as long as you can if you
    want the full three hits to connect.

 Quick Upper -  / m / 15
 Input » d/f+2  H adv  » +4
 F hit » 15     Hc adv » +4
 B adv » -7     CH adv » KD

  - This would be a good move to use right after you connect with the 1,2,3.
    If you connect with the d/f+2, quickly press 1, then f,f+2.  It's a 
    decent combo, so learn to use this in your juggle gameplay.

 Wind Hook Fist -  / h / 25
 Input » f,N,d,d/f+2  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 12           Hc adv » --
 B adv » -2           CH adv » KD

  - I prefer this over the Wind Godfist.  Right before the announcer says 
    "fight!", do the motion, then tap 2 as the words fade away, not to many
    opponents expect such an attack, because it is quick, it'll catch most
    people off guard.  Although the WGF has its perks, its main flaw is that
    it hits high, and also it doesn't launch, but rather sends them spiraling
    across the screen, if the wall if facing to the left (and your facing 
    right; vice versa for if you are facing left, you would use the Thunder
    Hook Fist) you can WGF the against the wall for some damage.

 Electric Wind Hook Fist -  / h / 25
 Input » f,N,d~d/f+2  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 11           Hc adv » --
 B adv » -1           CH adv » KD

  - This is the same as the Wind Hook Fist, only a little faster.  I mostly
    use this instead of the regular Wind Hook Fist.  Try to hit your opponent
    against the wall with this version of the Wind Hook Fist instead of the
    regular version in order to get free hits if they don't wall tech.

 Backfist to Side Swipe -  / hm / 12,21
 Input » b+2,3  H adv  » +1,+6
 F hit » 16     Hc adv » --,+6
 B adv » -4,-4  CH adv » +1,+6

  - This is a quick right backhand to a inner side kick, I use this in air 
    combos, but mix this in with the Twin Thrusts and the Mid Crusher varia-
    tions in order to keep your opponent guessing.

 Demon Paw Torso Thrust -  / m / 24
 Input » f,f+2  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 15     Hc adv » KD
 B adv » -11    CH adv » KD

  - A move he has previously kept, this is the ultimate long distance attack. 
    It has the same properties as Paul's Death Fist, but comes in a smaller 
    package. Since it used the f,f command it can be dash buffered for 
    greater range. This should be one of the most used moves in Jin's 
    arsenal. There really is nothing bad about this move at all. The only 
    negative I can see is that it telegraphs itself a little bit so people 
    will have a better chance of reversing it. However if you simply buffer a 
    chicken with it every time you perform it, the risk is nil. Only Law, 
    Ling and Lei have anything to stop it that you can't do anything about 
    and they'd be risking and Ling and Lei would be risking a hell of a lot 
    to even think of attempting it. Great for punishing slow recovery 
    attacks, whiffed attacks or just used at the end of juggles, this is one 
    move you will use a lot and should use a lot.


 Right Elbow -  / h / 22
 Input » f+2  H adv  » +7
 F hit » 16   Hc adv » --
 B adv » 0    CH adv » +28

  - I sometimes accidentally use this move, but for some reason, it seems to 
    always connect, it causes the opponent to stagger back abit.  It is slow
    startup animation might cause you to be hit, but if you by some chance
    hit your opponent on a counter hit, and they hold D to fall to the 
    ground, use the Twisting Demon Scissors to hit them.   

 Demon Godfist -  / m / 18
 Input » b,f+2  H adv  » -5
 F hit » 16     Hc adv » -5
 B adv » -6     CH adv » KD

  - A powerful punch indeed, it's slow but very powerful.  In order to get
    the best results from this move you'll have to catch your opponent on a
    counter hit.  When hit on a counter, they'll stagger just a bit, and
    fall back.  This is your chance when they stagger,  you can use the
    Demon Lift Kick in start a juggle combo, or follow up with a Kazama Fury.
    But note that the opponent can escape by tapping forward within the first
    20 frames of the stun so watch out if they do recover.  Use a Demon Paw
    Torso Thrust if they do recover, because 89% of the players out there
    tend to hold forward after they've recovered.

 Needle Shrine Cannon -  / mmm / 18,14,10
 Input » b,f+2>1>2  H adv  » -5,0,KD
 F hit » 16         Hc adv » -5,0,KD
 B adv » -6,-2,-5   CH adv » KD,0,KD

  - One of my favorite moves with Jin.  This is delayable, it has 3 different
    ways of ending excluding the just frame Needle Shrine Gates.  It's best
    delay the attack, that way the opponent will keep guessing of you are 
    going to either finish the combo, or stop and revert to some other move
    in Jin's listings.  The last hit can be sidestepped so stop after the 
    second hit, or if you are willing to take risks, use the 2 instead of
    d+2, it tends to track better to the sides and thus giving you a better
    opportunity to hit your opponent if they sidestep.  If you tap b during
    the needle shrine series, it'll cancel the Needle Shrine series and allow
    you to perform a 2,4, that should stop any SS attempts (from Ben Thayer).
    Or if you want a throw, stop after the second hit and throw the opponent, 
    or sidestep yourself, and perform a 1,2,3, (also from Ben Thayer) d+1, or 
    if you use 1,2,4, and they hit the wall, use the d/f+4 (Hell Gate Kick)
    for more damage.  Also 2,4 works well, and you can follow up with a d+1 
    if they happen to float.


 Needle Shrine Scraper - / mmm / 18,14,15
 Input » b,f+2>1>d+2  H adv  » -5,0,KD
 F hit » 16           Hc adv » -5,0,KD
 B adv » -6,-2,-9     CH adv » KD,0,KD

  - Just like the Cannon version, except this on launches you in the air.
    mix this up with the Needle Shrine Cannon and the Needle Shrine Gates
    to keep the opponent guessing.  If you launch your opponent perform a 
    decent air combo that'll drain their bar, or better yet, use the Hell
    Gate Kick if you are sure that they'll hit the wall, and if your lucky,
    they'll fall of the wall slowly so you can set them up for a wall combo.
    If you tap b during the needle shrine series, it'll cancel the Needle 
    Shrine series and allow you to perform a 2,4, that should stop any SS 
    attempts (from Ben Thayer).

 Axe Kick -  / m / 25
 Input » f,f+3  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 22     Hc adv » KD
 B adv » +2     CH adv » KD

  - Another type of Axe Kick that Jin has, if you hit, follow up with a 1.
    It's similar to Kazuya's 3,1 combo, except that your using a axe kick,
    followed by a Lead Thrust.  This can cancel into the following moves:

    Kazama Fury~Lingering Soul
    Lead Thrust~Jaw Kick
    Lead Thrust~(Vertical Kick~Blade Kick~Lingering Soul)
    
    This is very useful for setting up special types of combos with him.  
    Remember to always use the Lead Thrust for best combo results.  A 
    combo that I always perform when I hit my opponent with the f,f+3:
    f,f+3,1, f,f, 1, f,f, 1, f,N,d,d/f+2.  It does good damage for such a 
    short combo.  So learn to time the dashes so that you'll get the punches
    in.

 Inner Roundhouse to Shin Kick -  / hl / 15,15
 Input » b+3,4   H adv  » +6,-4
 F hit » 14      Hc adv » --,-4
 B adv » +2,-15  CH adv » KD,KD


  - This move is very slow, but do not underestimate it's abilities in 
    combos.  I use this move occasionally, and it's good to finish of a air
    combo.  A good time to use this move is when you have your opponent
    trapped in a corner, it'll confuse them with the way Jin rotate's his leg
    in a inner circle.  The beginning of the move comes out quick for a round
    kick also, use this move if you need some room, remember that the kick
    takes time to get in the air.

 Mid Kick -  / m / 16
 Input » f+3  H adv  » +6
 F hit » 12   Hc adv » +6
 B adv » -5   CH adv » +6

  - Your basic Mid Kick from Jin, just try to use this in custom combos, and
    confuse your opponent by switching between the f+4, b+4, d/f+4, and d/f+3
    to keep your opponent busy while you think of some new strategy.

 Vertical Kick -  / m / 22
 Input » f+3~3  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 22     Hc adv » KD
 B adv » +6     CH adv » KD

  - Jin will turn in foot inward while thrusting it down, mix this up with 
    the blade kick to confuse your opponent, a good combo finisher also.
    The ending animation for the kick will look as if Jin will return back
    to a neutral position whilst you can still cancel into 2 more attacks:
   
    Blade Kick, and the Lingering Soul if the Blade Kick connects.  
   
    I'd perform the Lingering Soul only if the opponent was hit by the Blade 
    Kick on a counter hit, because the counter hit version leaves him or her
    stun falling to the ground.

 Heaven Gate Kick -  / m / 15
 Input » d/f+3  H adv  » -3
 F hit » 14     Hc adv » -3
 B adv » -7     CH adv » KD

  - This kick should be mixed in with the f+3, f+4, d/f+4, and the d/f+3.  It
    can also be canceled into the Lingering Soul.  I use this sometimes, but 
    only if I have my opponent in the corner.  This kick momentarily stuns
    your opponent (not like Steve's Stun Gun Punch).

 Devious Kick to Left Blade - d+3,3 / lm / 7,10
 Input » d+3,3    H adv  » 0,-6
 F hit » 15       Hc adv » 0,-6
 B adv » -11,-15  CH adv » 0,-2

  - I quick kick to the low and then a kick to the mid.  IF the first hit 
    connects, the second one is guaranteed to hit.  Use this to finish off
    a floating air combo, as sometimes the low kick will hit the opponent
    high enough for the second one to hit.  Also a good strategy is after
    executing a 2,1, cancel and execute the d+3,3.

 Demon Roundhouse -  / h / 28
 Input » (WS_f,N,d,d/f)+3  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 19                Hc adv » KD
 B adv » 0                 CH adv » KD

  - Use this after ducking an attack, such as Kazuya's Shining Fists or 
    Steve's British Edge High combo, the hit alone does enough damage that
    will satisfy you, but a I'll give you a quick list of tricky combos that
    could be done after a few certain hits:
    
    WALL STUN REQUIRED
    
    b,f+2,1(2_d+2*), iWS+3
    iWS+2, iWS+3
    after opponent gets wall stunned, iWS+3

    This are just some of the possibilities that you may find will using this
    kick, it's a powerful move, so learn to use it properly.  Also crouch
    dash (usually referred to as CD) games are useful here, mix this with
    his Stature Sweep and his two Hook Fists.  If the opponent thinks you're
    going to cancel and switch to the low hitting moves, this would be a 
    nice mix up game, as some opponents actually have the habit of blocking
    high, and it causes a small stun.

 Demon Lift Kick -  / mm / 5,15
 Input » d+3+4  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 14     Hc adv » KD
 B adv » -20    CH adv » KD

  - Ahh...the old days of juggling with the renamed "can-can kicks".  Best to
    use this after the Double Over Stun with Demon Godfist, a quick combo:
   
    CH b,f+2, d+3+4, 1, f,f, 1, f,f, 1, f,f, 1,3~3, d+4.
   
    This is a nice combo, plus it looks really cool.  Also if your opponent
    tends to run up to you alot, then do the Demon Lift Kicks, it's range 
    maybe short, but if you're lucky, they'll be caught by the first kick, 
    and juggled in the air by the second one.

 Crouch Dash Slash Kick -  / m / 30
 Input » f,N,d,d/f,f,u/f+3  H adv  » [n/a yet]
 F hit » [n/a yet]          Hc adv » [n/a yet]
 B adv » [n/a yet]          CH adv » [n/a yet]

  - This is just the same if you were to tap f,f,f+3, or run then press 3.
    But never the less it's a nice move to use.  You slam your opponent into
    the wall, you should try to connect this move, as it does a massive 
    amount of damage if you hit them against the wall with this attack.

 Spinning Roundhouse - 3 / h / 30
 Input » (u/b_u/f)+3  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 21           Hc adv » KD
 B adv » -5           CH adv » KD

  - Jins old T3 and TTT style kick has changed a little, its old command
    was just f+3, now they have altered it.  if you can pin your opponent
    against the wall with this move, its best to follow up with a quick
    damaging combo, but I prefer the Needle Shrine Cannon.  And it causes
    you opponent to spin to the side also, so thats a nice move to set up
    if you're near a wall, it will knock them into it (it spins them to the
    left; so use it when the wall is on your left) use moves like the
    Battle Kick for good results, as it will kick them back into the wall.

 Leaping Slash Kick - / m / 30
 Input » (WR_f,f,f)+3  H adv  » [n/a yet]
 F hit » [n/a yet]     Hc adv » [n/a yet]
 B adv » [n/a yet]     CH adv » [n/a yet]

  - This is the same exact kick as the CROUCH DASH SLASH KICK, so please 
    refer to that move for the strategy, but it's best to use this after
    you've knocked down your opponent.  Step back after you've knocked
    your opponent down, and let him get up (as most tend to mash the kick 
    buttons) and kick nothing but air, then while he's kicking input the
    command and you'll luckily get in a free hit. 

 Battle Kick -  / M / 21
 Input » f+4  H adv  » +3
 F hit » 20   Hc adv » -2
 B adv » -9   CH adv » KD

  - This has got to be one of my favorite kicks of all time with Jin!  It
    has the same properties as Kazuya's Glorious Demon Fist! And that opens
    pathways to new combo opportunities.  I've used this in every match that
    I have fought in, it's combo potential is just wide.  for instance, this
    scenario of Marshall Law versus Jin: Law tries to perfrom the Shaolin 
    Spin Kicks, and Jin is a just a bit away, he performs the Battle Kick, 
    and Law keels over!  crouch dash Tsunami Kick, and a Mid Thrust to Shin
    Kick to finish the combo off.  It would be shown as this in abbreviated 
    form:

    CH f+4, f,N,d,d/f,f+4, d/f+1,4~4

    It may seem like a weak combo, but trust me, you'll learn to use this 
    kick alot more often once you realize how powerful it can be, especially
    when you hit your opponent against the wall and they bounce, giving you
    even more combo opportunities.


 Spin Heel Kick -  / m / 18
 Input » b+4  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 17   Hc adv » KD
 B adv » -7   CH adv » KD

  - This is just a quick turn around kick that'll knock your opponent back 
    far enough for you to give you time to plan your next attack, or to just 
    get some breathing space.  This kick is perfect for people who like to 
    guard, as it hit's mid, some may not hold d/b when blocking low, so you 
    have a fifty/fifty chance of hitting them.

 Hell Gate Kick -  / m / 33
 Input » d/f+4  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 19     Hc adv » KD
 B adv » -17    CH adv » KD

  - Let's get one thing straight: this kick should be used very, very often.
    I don't care how slow it is (although it does affect your gaming), if you
    hit your opponent and they hit the wall and fall, a free demon sweep is
    guaranteed, or if you got some air combo skills, just juggle the hell out
    of them for massive damage.  A combo that I use:
   
    d/f+4 [w!], 1, f,f, 1, f,f, 1,2,4
 
    This does great damage and can be a bit tricky to pull of but you'll soon
    know when to start it.  I abuse this move very much (because it's my all-
    time favorite thing to do with Jin:) and because people tend to run into
    this when they knock you back far away and think they can get in a free 
    tackle or running stomp. 

 Outer Axe Kick -  / M / 19
 Input » f,f+4  H adv  » +6
 F hit » 20     Hc adv » +8
 B adv » +4     CH adv » +6

  - This Axe Kick hits opponents on the ground also, so if you have a problem
    performing the Twisting Demon Scissors, then this would be your second
    choice.  It does decent damage and learn to use this to finish combos of
    too.  one combo is: WS+2 1, 1,2,4 [w!] f,f+4.  This combo will connect
    only if they hit the wall and fall. so work that into the formula also.

 Tsunami Kick -  / m / 13
 Input » (WS_f,N,d,d/f,f)+4  H adv  » +8
 F hit » 11                  Hc adv » +8
 B adv » -3                  CH adv » +8

  - Looks like Jin has altered his Tsunami Kicks a little, it's basically
    just a straight kick forward, and a quick one at that, use this in 
    junction with the Battle Kick for good combo results.
 
 Demon Sweep -  / L / 15
 Input » d+4  H adv  » -4
 F hit » 16   Hc adv » -4
 B adv » -15  CH adv » -4

  - A quick wide ranging sweep, that is mostly used for hitting someone on 
    the ground.  Use it against someone who is rolling around, who is taking 
    a nap on the floor, or who is in the corner.  Most people when cornered, 
    panic and are susceptible to three sweeps in a row.  But some of them 
    will get smart and (1,2) you before you get the next sweep in.  Yes this
    is susceptible to a counter jab.  BUT, if they are cornered and lying 
    down, then you have several sweeps guaranteed.  For pokers who like to 
    jab 1,2,3, d+1 is crucial as the d+1 will go below them and land as a 
    counter plus you have a huge frame advantage so not many mid attacks can 
    stop it and only one comes to mind that can do any significant damage.
    (from Ben Thayer).

 Shin Kick -  / L / 15
 Input » d/b+4  H adv  » -3
 F hit » 20     Hc adv » -3
 B adv » -14    CH adv » KD

  - A quick kick to the shin, it's useful for breaking certain jab strings,
    and ending some combos, but other than that, try not to use this move to
    often, as your opponent will start to suspect the kick and try to low
    parry it.  But it is useful for hitting your opponents that like to stay
    on the ground.

 Stature Sweep -  / l / 18
 Input » f,N,d,D/F+4  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 20           Hc adv » KD
 B adv » -12          CH adv » KD

  - Vary between the Thunder Hook Fist, the Wind Hook Fist, and this 
    Stature Sweep.  It helps to vary this move as the motions are the
    same with the Thunder Hook and Wind Hook Fist.  I've landed at least
    one of each move (the Thunder/Wind Hook Fists) and the Stature Sweep
    only because I varied these moves.  Also good to hit the opponent
    when you've performed many Thunder/Wind Hook Fists, as they'll try to
    block the Hook Fists, they'll be hit by the sweep instead. Also, this
    move can be canceled in the Lingering Soul only if it hits or the
    Twisting Demon Scissors.

 Snap Lift Kick - / h / 25
 Input » (u_u/f)+4  H adv  » +6
 F hit » 16         Hc adv » --
 B adv » -5         CH adv » +6

  - Much like Kazuya's u/f,N,4 kick. Try performing a 1,2,3 or 1,2,4 after
    hitting your opponent with this kick for some damage. or better yet hit
    them against the wall using this attack.  If it hits on a regular hit,
    it'll cause your opponent to be lifted off the ground floor, but not 
    high enough to juggle, and it will leave you at an disadvantage.  If 
    it hits on a CH, you'll have a chance to aerial combo your opponent. 

 Spin Demon -  / h / 25
 Input » u/f,N+4    H adv  » [n/a yet]
 F hit » [n/a yet]  Hc adv » [n/a yet]
 B adv » [n/a yet]  CH adv » [n/a yet]

  - Exactly like the Hop Kick to Twisting Demon Scissors.  Use this sparingly
    because it is slow but powerful, bait your opponent into coming within 
    it's range by using the Snap Lift Kick and the Devious Kick to Left 
    Blade.

 Twisting Demon Scissors -  / M / 28
 Input » (4~3_WS+4~3)  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 24            Hc adv » KD
 B adv » --            CH adv » KD

  - Jin's Demon Scissors sure have changed since the last time we saw him use
    this move, now he rotates his hips in a circle while swinging his body
    along with the momentum.  This attack is good for people who like to stay
    on the ground, but it has short range, and if you perform it to close, 
    he'll roll over his opponent.  Try using this after a 1,2,3 combo some 
    times for some damage.

 Lingering Soul -  / -- / --
 Input » b+1+2  H adv  » -22
 F hit » -16    Hc adv » -22
 B adv » -22    CH adv » -22

  - This command is only if you are performing it from a neutral standing
    position, and not after a move. 

    Use d+1+2 after the following connects:
   
    Kazama Fury
    Lead Thrust-Blade Kick
    Demon Hell Thrusts
    Backfist-Side Swipe
    Heaven Gate Kick
    Hell Gate Kick
    Battle Kick
    Stature Sweep
 
    This is only after the move hits!!! While you are in this state, you can-
    not block and any move that hit's you will be considered a counter hit!
    So use this move sparingly, unless you want to be optimistic, perform the
    Lingering Soul then do the Lingering Soul Omen, then perform the Omen 
    Wind Hook Fist (ooh...bright blue colors...>.<).  You can perform the
    Soul Step Reversal by quickly tapping ~f,f,b+2+4_b+1+3 immediately after
    inputting the Lingering Soul, you'll know when you've done it by the 
    red sparks that appear when he reverses the attack; and he will rotate
    his hands depending on which command you inputted (if you used b+2+4, Jin
    will rotate to the left, if you used b+1+3 he'll go to the right).

 Lingering Soul Taunt - -- / -- / --

 F hit » [n/a yet]  Hc adv » [n/a yet]
 B adv » [n/a yet]  CH adv » [n/a yet]

  - There is only one reason I included this in this section: it's damn 
    cool...Jin simply does the animation for when he performs the Lingering 
    Soul.  Use this right after you finish your opponent off or something 
    similar.  This is also one of the kata Jin does in Tekken Tag as a win
    pose.

 High Parry - -- / -- / --
 Input » b+2+4  H adv  » 0
 F hit » 2      Hc adv » --

  - When you high parry any attack, Jin will simply sidestep, but you will 
    not even notice as the sidestep animation is extremely short.  And as for 
    the parry animation, it's so quick that all he does is just opens his 
    palms.  Learn to use this effectively, as it is a life saver.  A good 
    attack to do after you've parried you opponent's attack is the Demon Lift 
    Kick to the Rear Thrust-Roundhouse.  It's quick so you'll have to really 
    pay attention when you do this parry.

 Needle Shrine Gates - #1 JG / mm! / 18,14,22
 Input » b,f+2,1,d+2*_:d+2  H adv  » -5,0,KD
 F hit » 16                 Hc adv » -5,0,KD
 B adv » -6,-2,KD           CH adv » KD,0,KD

  - This move is one of Jin's best (and one of his most abusable ones) move,
    it comes becomes unblockable if you hold down the d+2, and the most
    useful thing to do is to 'Just Frame' it by inputting b,f+2,1:d+2.  To
    JF the move, just release the d+2 AS SOON AS HE BEGINS TO GLOW BLUE CHI.
    There are two points to where you can release, which is really tricky;
    the first release point is where his hand just releases 3 or 4 small
    balls of blue chi.  The second release point is when he has eight to 12
    smail balls of blue chi.  You will know when you done the JF version of
    this move when you do not see a large trail of blue chi.

 Eighth Gate of Hell - -- / ! / 100
 Input » u/b+1+2  H adv  » KD
 F hit » 75       Hc adv » KD
 B adv » KD       CH adv » KD

  - Jin's most powerful unblockable, it is slow, but does alot of damage.
    the chances of you hitting a expert with this move are very slim, but
    never doubt it.  A cheap thing to do when playing against the computer is
    to perform the Kazama Fury (1,3,2,1,4) then immediately do the u/b+1+2.
    It will connect on the first few rounds depending on the difficulty.  But
    my advice is to NEVER try this move whenever you are in a match against
    a human opponent unless you are playing a scrub who doesn't know what the
    hell is going to happen when he sees all the pretty little lightning 
    sparks of energy.  Use this move if you are will to take a HUGE risk.

 Now, I'm sure most of you readers scrolled down to look for a combo section,
 so here it is.  It has some pretty easy combos, and some insanely hard combo
 links as well.  I won't be putting the difficulty by the combo, I will put
 the combo number, the max amount of hits in the combo (meaning if there is a
 optional input, it'll count as hit(s)) , and the damage it does.  Note that
 every combo section has a number listing beginning with one, and each
 combo section is numbered according to how many combos they have in each
 section.  Combo's that I came up with, I put the initials au. by them, also
 if a combo has more than one combo starter, and you try a combo that doesn't
 work, then try the other combo starters listed.  Combo variations are the
 other combos that you can do for that starter, for instance the Needle 
 Shrine Gates combo starter has combo variations, which are all of the
 standard combos:

 examples:

COMBO STARTER(s) : starter move(s) to begin combo [name of move]
COMBO VARIATIONS : combos that are compatible 
NOTE: extra key notes that might need to be known, or remarks/comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMBO STARTER(s) : b,f+2,1(:d+2*_d+2) [Needle Shrine Gates / Scraper]
COMBO VARIATIONS : standard combos

 that just simply means you can perform any standard combo (which I listed
 in parenthesis in all caps) from the b,f+2,1(:d+2*,d+2) starter or from
 any other combo for that matter if it is listed as so.

 PSL - Post Stun Launcher
 au. - author's combo (me)

 These will be used throughout this listing, a post stun launcher is a 
 move that launches your opponent in the air after a stun, for example,
 Jin's Demon Godfist on a counter hit (b,f+2), after that, you can
 follow up with a d+3+4 since that is one of Jin's post stun launchers.
 Although soem are guaranteed and some are not.

 FINAL NOTE: The 1 and 2 jabs in the combos you see below are optional!
 So if you have problems performing a combo, then just do fewer jabs
 so that you may connect the combo string, or if you'd like, you can add more
 jabs to the combos below, but also remember some are required to make the 
 combo completely connect.

 vs. TIPS:

 Now that we're done with the special arts list and combo listings (whoa!
 like, that was really long!), I can finally tell you how to beat other types 
 of opponents and the COM (or CPU) using several types of techniques which of 
 course will give you the upper hand. Also if you have any strategies please 
 feel free to send them in, and put the subject as t4 vs. strategy.  A good 
 way to know more about your opponent is to use the people you usually don't 
 play with, as it will help you to understand that character better. 

 NOTE: These strategies were based on the hardest difficulty of the game and
 from tourney gatherings I have been to.

 - vs. KUMA / PANDA -
 One thing to watch out for when playing against cheese Kuma/Panda 
 characters, if they perform f,f+2, they can do a Salmon Hunter, which takes
 of a lot of damage, well not unless you tech roll off course.  If they do
 the JF Slamon Hunter, you should roll back
 
 - vs. HWOARANG -
 When fighting against the COM, there are to things to really watch
 out for: 1) his flamingos; and 2) his stances, if you know which stance he
 is in, then you will know what to look out for.  Use your 1,2 and 2,1 mix-
 up strings to keep him from using attacking, and when you think he will 
 attempt a launcher, sidestep and throw, or use the 2,4 attack to give your-
 self some breathing room. Now I haven't played to many Hwoarang players, but
 being a seasoned Hwoarang player, I would know what to look out for.  Most
 veterans and above players will try to use the crouch dash game and mix-up
 his f,N,d,d/f,f+3 and his f,f+2 throw.  If your opponent starts to do this,
 use the f+4 kick, it has enough distance to knock Hwoarang out of his stance
 flamingo if they are close enough.  But be aware that it is slow, so I'd 
 prefer to sidestep when ever they start a crouch dash game.  And if your 
 opponent starts to begin a flamingo mix-up game, use the f,f+2 to knock him 
 out of it, it has plenty of distance, so use the move to its full potential, 
 and keep back when your opponent starts to flamingo.  Also do not be caught 
 with Hwoarangs's 2,f+3 and 2,f+4 strings on a counter hit, as those are 
 guaranteed hits if they do connect.  Advanced players also tend to use
 the triple sidestep, and that is something that you must watch for, this
 allows Hwoarang to move behind you and do some damage.

 - vs. YOSHIMITSU -
 Yoshimitsu has a lot of moves, but with the exception of the d/f+4 (which 
 must be sidestepped anticipating on the right), and his f,f+4 (anticipating 
 on the right), they are not difficult to sidestep; I will list some of them: 
 d/f+2 can be sidestepped on both directions b+3,1 on both directions 4-3 
 very easily on the left d/f+1,1,1,1  very easily on the left b+1,1,1 easily 
 on the right, the first two hits even on the left (attack immediately after) 
 u/f+4 on both directions d/b+1 on both directions b+1+2, on the left.

 - vs. JULIA CHANG -
 I think that Julia is a very good character; she can't be sidestepped easily 
 since almost of her combo which have a low kick will hit you whenever you go 
 on the right or on the left; however it is still possible to make a side-
 stepping game when she performs certain moves: d,D/F+1,2.. you can sidestep 
 this attack on both directions, even if sidestepping it on the left is
 easier; if she performs a d,D/F+1-delayed 2, you will be able to SS even 
 after having blocked the first hit (you must go on the left). Another attack 
 that you can sidestep is 1,1,1; you should go on the right and, if you want 
 to show some skill, immediately do a WS+2; in this way you may even hit her 
 if she performs 1,1,4,3(before the first low kick which will otherwise hit 
 you). In general you will be able to sidestep her whenever she uses long 
 ranged moves (f,f+1 for example) otherwise it will be a suicide.

 - vs. LEE CHAOLAN / VIOLET -
 One attack to watch for is his Acid kick combo, if it hits on counter, the
 rest of the kicks are gauranteed to connect, and from that stun that it
 causes, you can take a ton of damage from this combo: f+3:3:3, d/f+1, cc,
 1,2~f,N, 1,2~f,N, b+1(1)~f,N~b+3,3,d+3.  Its a devestating combo, so watch
 for that.  Also watch for his Silver Sting and Quick Silver Sting.  His
 Hitman Stance is also something to be aware off, from the hitman, he has
 a throw, a launcher, a sweep, and a jab off course in his arsenal, if you 
 block his Hitman Low Sweep, follow up with WS+2 and juggle Lee; block the
 Hitman Backhand and follow up with f,N,d,d/f+3 for some damage, or use
 the Stature Sweep.  If Lee performs the Mist Feint Trap combo, duck the
 second hit, although block the first, because if you are hit on CH from
 the first kick of the Mist Trap Feint combo, the second hit is gauranteed,
 and that also gives your opponent a chance for a Mist Trap Throw.

 - vs. LING XIAOYU / MIHARU -
 Ling is another one of those characters which can be difficult to sidestep; 
 the main two attacks I can suggest you how to SS are f,f+1+2,1+2 which must
 be sidestepped on the right and her BK,4 which should be sidestepped on the 
 left. Her f,f+3 must be sidestepped on the left, while her db+1 can be 
 sidestepped on both directions. Her Phoenix Stance(d+1+2) can be very 
 dangerous, but in this case the sidestepping game can be useful; the Tooth 
 Fairy is, when she is in this stance, Jin's best juggle starter, so don't be 
 afraid to use it. Ling is a very strong character and her sidestepping game 
 is the best in the game, so be careful not to became the prey instead of the 
 hunter. 

 - vs. CRAIG MARDUK -

 - vs. LEI WULONG -
 Watch for his Razor Rush combo, he can cancel into any of his 5 animal
 Qigong stances.  And watch for d/b+4,4, alot of people tend to abuse this
 move.  He also has a PLD stance and a KND position also, so don't let those
 fool you, use a 4~3 if they go into these positions, as it hits Low and 
 grounded opponents. 

 - vs. KAZUYA MISHIMA -
 Don't worry about his ewgf, or his crouch dash game, but his WS moves.
 WS+1,2 is gauranteed if it connects on CH.  Also watch for his WS+2, which
 is inescapable now by the way (so if your playing against a expert, and by
 some miracle it connects, your screwed).  But remember, the crouch dash 
 game is still applicable in this Tekken also, they can cancel into either
 WGFs, can cancel and go into Kazuya's WS moves, and also they can mist step,
 by f,N,d,d/f,f~f,N.  Parry his 1,1,2 (the second or last hit), his 1,2,2,
 and parry the 4 in his 1,2,4.  Also parry his WGFs, since they hit high now
 by the way.

 - vs. PAUL PHOENIX -
 
 - vs. JIN KAZAMA -
 If Jin starts to do the Needle Shrine Cannon links (aka the Laser
 Scraper series), just sidestep to the right after you block the second hit,
 it'll give you enough time to land a free f,f+2 or a 1,2,3_4 if you are
 close enough to hit them.  Also watch for seasoned Jin players, they tend
 to use his High parry and counter with a 1+2 or a Demon Lift Kick (d+3+4).
 so use the 2,1 series, as the 1 hits mid, they won't be able to parry it.
 Also if a cheese Jin player starts the 1,2,3_4 and does it repeatedly, you
 can sidestep the 3 in the 1,2,3 string after if you are quick enough, but
 parry first hit, because if you parry the second hit the Roundhouse may
 track your sidestep and hit you, and the 3 may hit you if you sidestepped
 to the left.  Watch for the d+4 Demon Sweep also, because it is a quick hit,
 most players will throw this in with their mixup games so watch for this.

 - vs. NINA WILLIAMS -
 Nina is a strong character which has all the weapons to be divesting; she is 
 even not easy to sidestep, since she can perform a large number of quick 
 pokes and short strings. I will focus on those attacks which will juggle or 
 hit you at mid-long range:d/b+3+4, her standard juggle starter, must be 
 sidestepped on the right; you must be at short-mid range or the kick may hit 
 you. d/b+4,3, this variation of the previous kick is a bit tricky to 
 sidestep, cause you  must go (anticipating) on the right with an interrupted 
 SS; you will take the first kick but the second will miss, so that you can 
 juggle her. The f,f+3 kick is quite easy to sidestep 'cause you can go on 
 both directions, from long range I suggest to go on the left. Let's go to 
 her hand attacks: d,D/F+2 can be sidestepped early on the right or always on 
 the left; the f+1+2 is a bit tricky 'cause it must be sidestepped 
 anticipating on the right, or you will be hit. About her pokes and short 
 strings, I suggest you to learn how to sidestep the first hit and attack 
 immediately after the SS.

 - vs. STEVE FOX -
 Most beginners tend to mash or repeatedly do 1,2,1,2 or similar variations 
 of that string, parry only when you think you will connect with it.  Just 
 sidestep once they start come near you, and when you sidestep, do a quick
 hitting combo such as the 2,4 to knock him out of it.  More advanced
 Steve players use the optional command of (~3_4) after several of Steve's 
 strings, so watch out and have a mid hitting move ready, such as a d/f+1 or
 d/f+2. 

 
 - vs. CHRISTIE MONTEIRO / EDDY GORDO -

 - vs. BRYAN FURY -
 Many Bryan players use single powerful moves, and whenever you are facing 
 one of them you should be able to sidestep him quite easily; his WS+3
 _d,d/f,f+3 can be easily sidestepped on the left and the same goes for his 
 WS+1_d,d/f,f+1; the f,f+2 is a very fast attack but if you anticipate the SS 
 you can do it on both directions. The WS+2_d,d/f,f+2 can be sidestepped more 
 easily on the right, but since it is a slow attack you should be able to 
 sidestep it even on the left, just by anticipating a little the SS (an  
 "interrupted" SS will work too. Even his d/f+1,2 (d/f+2) of d/f+4 can both 
 be sidestepped on the left, you should only anticipate a little the SS or do 
 an "interrupted" SS. This are the most common attacks, but not the most 
 effective; whenever you will fight against a player who uses Bryan's short 
 combos(or just the first hits of them), you will have problems in 
 sidestepping him; in this case go with other strategies...

 - vs. HEIHACHI MISHIMA -

 - vs. KING the 2nd -
 Sidestepping King can be a difficult task since his most useful moves have 
 to be sidestepped on different directions: his d/f+3,..d/f+2..FC,d/f+1 must 
 be sidestepped on the left, while f,f+2, and u/f+4(his most common juggle 
 starter) must be sidestepped on the right; other good attacks can be 
 sidestepped on both directions: d/f+1,..f,f+4,..b+4..FC,d/f+2. 

 - vs. MARSHALL LAW -
 Law is a tough opponent, but as long as you stay at long range, he is not so 
 difficult to sidestep. At this distance his main weapons are b+1,(2,1) and 
 b+2(,3,4); the first one can be easily sidestepped on the right (the third 
 hit of the combo must be sidestepped on the left, so whenever you sidestep 
 the first punch you should attack immediately or the last one may hit you 
 anyway) while b+2 should be sidestepped on the left; however even if you go 
 on the right when he performs b+2,3,4 you will be hit only by the first hit 
 of the combo, the other two will miss and you will be able to hit him. His 
 UF+4,3+4 can be sidestepped on both sides while the u/f+4 must be
 sidestepped on the right. As for all the other characters you will start to 
 have some problems when Law comes at close range with his quick jab attacks; 
 his main p0unch strings are 1~1,.. and its variations, and f+2,2(2); in the 
 first case you can sidestep on the right the first two punches and 
 immediately attack, before the third comes out. About f+2,2,(2) ,you can 
 sidestep on the right the first punch and immediately attack (or the second 
 and third will hit you) or you can sidestep the whole combo on the left 
 (remember however that you can duck under the third punch). As you may have 
 noticed you will be able to SS him easily, but you must be reactive and 
 attack as soon as you have sidestepped, or you may be hit by another attack.  
 Watch for hisDragon Sign Stance and his Fake Step Stance, he can cancel into 
 a few moves, such as his Thrust Side Kick and his Junkyard Combo.  Also
 his Dragon Roar combos.

 123 gives you an ungodly frame advantage following up with a needle shrine
 series is hard to stop(Certified Scrub Killer and a decent setup for high
 level playing).  For pokers who like to jab 123 d+1 is crucial as the d+1 
 will go below them and land as a counter plus you have a huge frame
 advantage so not many mid attacks can stop it and only 1 comes to mind that 
 can do any significant damage(DO NOT ABUSE THIS). 

 Never finishing the needle shrine is a favorite of mine to do in tag.  I 
 would either throw or when opp SS I would do 112 which stopped any early 
 attempt to SS.  After a while your opponent will become confused and is at 
 your mercy for juggling.  Its a bit different in T4 you can come out and do 
 123 for pressure and you can still throw but Jins best anti SS move is 2,4.  
 I find that tapping b can cancel out the Needle shrine and enable you to do 
 a 2,4 and that should stop any future SS attempts. 

 Favorite tactic move opp to a position where the wall is on his right side 
 and then do b,f 2,1, JF2 b+3 1 3~3 d+4.  When done right this is not 
 stoppable except for a low jab before the JF2 and even that is hard.  The 
 wall stops them from SS.  High level and veteran players know this and as a 
 result A.  Don't allow them selves to be moved into position for it.  B.  
 Don't even bother trying to stop it with the hope they can get a wall tech 
 instead of taking a CH.
