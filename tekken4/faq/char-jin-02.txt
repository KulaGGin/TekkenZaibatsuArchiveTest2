It is intended for beginners and average players who need advice on Jin. I take some
knowledge for granted, like the importance of jabbing and the EWGF concept.

When I make changes to FAQ's, I try to make big changes. So please check frequently for
newer versions of this FAQ in the coming months.

*1. Why Jin??*
**************


I loved Jin in Tekken 3. When I played with my roomies at Boston College, his style, look
and rivalry with Hwoarang all appealed to me. Then I came to Korea for a semester. Then I
saw TTT. Then I saw all the cheese Koreans playin Jin like a bad record usin the EGWH,
double pistons and uppercuts like it was their freakin' job. Then I started to hate Jin.

But all that has changed now. Jin's different boys and girls, and for all of those who are
dissapointed because they use cheese-Jin in TTT; Hahahahahahahhahaahahahahah!! Jin is now a
bull-dogging, mean-jabbing, block-breaking, decent-launching, powerhouse. Forget everything
you've learned. And if you're new to Jin, then all the better.

Jin is becoming more used now, but many of his strategies have been very unexplored. The
game hasn't been released for long, and if any monkey-ass thinks he can use the same Jin
strategies he's using now, several months later, he'll become everyone's punch dummy.
Therefore, he is like a loaded gun who's bullets may become blanks and whose blanks may
become bullets. He is by far, the most watched player, and therefore, the most dynamic.


**********************************
*2. THE "must-use" move list*
**********************************


1. Jab String Setup (1,2...) combos

   This fast, extremely versatile setup has great potential for consistent damage to those
   who duck, sidestep and just don't plain know when to block. I won't explain the
   importance of jabs, you should all know by now.
   
   - 3 - A hell of a guard breaking kick. My favorite. It is fast and uninterruptable. It's
         easy to execute. And best of all, because it guard breaks, you can throw out any
         number of these, one right after another without fear of counter jabs. The guard
         break causes the player to step back a little, but the distance is so short, you're
         close enough to start another (1,2,...) string. The 3 kick will hit anyone who is
         trying to duck and will guard break those who block high. If it connects, he will
         be hit straight down, your chance for a Demon Sweep (d+4). The only way to avoid
         the 3 kick is to side-step.
   - 4 - That's where this comes in. The 4 kick is just as uninterruptable and guard
         breaking and is a spinning back roundhouse that hits high and has a wide side
         range. In other words, a person who tries to sidestep the jabs will get smacked.
         You must beware of those who duck. But if you're like me, you will usually use the
         above combo and they won't really think about ducking anymore. This combo, however,
         if used twice in a row will push the player far away enough that the gap cannot be
         surpassed with a jab. Meaning, you must move forward to start another Jab String.
         But, if you'd like to put some distance between you and your opponent, well then,
         this is actually safer then just retreating.


         Using these two in conjunction will make most players stumble for a little while,
         either they got hit with the second round of jabs, because they tried to counter
         jab, or they got smacked by either kick. This stumbling time is your advantage. You
         can dish out a throw, a sweep, change your position or just plain chip them away if
         they are in a corner. The first and last are my personal favorites. You're not
         limited to Jab String setups either. Since it guard breaks, throw out a Kazama Rage
         combo, or a (2,1..) combo, since the first jab of that combo is just as quick as
         the Jab String combos. But if you're content to just throw out Jab String after Jab
         String, it is a great way to burn time. A tactic that is extremely important and
         akin to the long throws and take downs that King and Marduk have. If you have more
         energy, just throw these out and let the time burn.

         Trust me when I say this, if you throw out 3 (1,2, -3) Jab Strings in a row, the
         opponent, 90% of the time has no choice but to block for the whole time. During
         EVERY single round, I do this at least once to them because it allows me to control
         the pace of the fight. Nearly 80& of the time I do this, I tag them with a jab or a
         kick because they just don't plain expect you to throw out the same combo three
         times in a row and Yes, also because it is that hard to avoid and get out of.

         If you take just ONE thing from this FAQ, it is this. The potential for damage,
         okizeme and the ability to control the pace of the match for nearly 4 seconds of 
         the fight is not to be underestimated. There is one time I try to refrain from
         using this and that's when I fight other Jins. The fact is, when they see how good
         this particular repeating strategy is, after I maul them with this, they adopt it
         immediately because it is so easy. And I don't like NO ONE controllin the match
         'cept for ME. HOO-AH!

         As mentioned above, it isn't impossible to duck the second round of Jab Strings.
         It's just friggin hard. If you come across someone who can consistently duck your
         second round of Jab Strings, then you have no choice but to learn the next move on
         the list, and switch up between the two.


2. Alternate Jab String Setup (2,1...) combos

   This is another fast setup, which is particularly used because of the second punch of
   the series which is a gut punch to the mid section.

   - 4 - This combo is a little slower than the Jab String combos; in the fact that the
         following jab has less range and is a couple of frames slower. The 4 kick is a mid
         kick which is useful against duckers or for giving yourself a little bit of 
         breathing room. It's ok, but there are better things.
   - 4~4 - The third hit is a delayed low kick which is confusing because of Jin's movement.
           However, abuse of this real lead to a ducking block and probably an uppercut
           launcher. I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVE.


         These two combos can be used to alternate with the Jab String combos, but only
         after you're sure they will commit to blocking high. The (2,1...) followup has less
         range, so a counter-jab is possible by your opponent.

         However, I've only found only Jin, Law and Steve players who can counter-jab. Jin
         because he knows what's coming. Law and Steve because their jabs are slightly
         faster. Otherwise, most people get raped by this move. They duck and are all ready
         to hit you with a Rising Uppercut, only to get tagged by the 2nd mid punch. This'll
         set you up for more Jab Strings because his duck won't stick! He'll be forced to
         stand!!

         These two types of Jab Strings are definitely your startup game. They are quick to
         initiate, can be used to keep an opponent pinned and closeby; can be used to
         distance yourself from an opponent, (i.e. the 1,2,-4 string), can be used to corner
         someone and be also used to burn time. The opponent, is either getting hit,
         blocking or stumbling. And therefore no need to worry about defense!


3. Rear Thrust (2,4)

   A simple one two combo. A quick right jab, followed by a spinning back roundhouse kick to
   the face. Its strong, requires little effort and has a short reset time.

         Does the non-immediacy sound like a disadvantage? Far from it. This move is very
         useful against Parry Counterers (Paul, Nina) and Parriers (Law, Steve, Jin). When 
         someone like Paul tries to parry counter your second jab which he thinks is coming,
         he will only get smacked by the kick which is delayed just long enough to avoid the
         parry counter. In the case of regular Parriers, many of them will think that after
         they parry your 2, they have the next (1,2) all to the themselves. But the 4 will
         smack them for a counter-hit if they try to initiate a move!!! You can even use
         this as a very safe poke since it is quick to initiate and has a short reset time.
         You won't find many people ducking the kick of the Rear Thrust since any
         experienced player will be more worried about the possibilty of a (2,1, ...) since
         the 1 hits mid. Another use for this move is explained later.


4. Parry (b+2+4)

   This is a high move parry, that when catching a move, will not counter-throw, or
   counter-hit, but will simply, move Jin very slightly to the side. Once to the side, Jin
   has higher counter priority. The delay caused to your opponent is very slight, and almost
   unnoticeable. The reset time of a whiffed parryis incredibly slight and probably less
   so than a parry counter. I can't be completely sure, but in all the matches I've ever
   played I've never been counterhit when I attempted a parry unless they hit low.

         If an opponent throws a 3 hit punch combo, you must block the last 2 hits even if
         you parried the first punch. Even to the side, punches will cause the attacker to
         correct his direction slightly. However, straight punches like Law's Repeating
         Punch (1,1,1,1,1) will completely whiff. Also I've found that a few 1,2 jabs will
         whiff also. After, parrying, YOU WILL HAVE A GUARANTEED 2,4. Good damage. ^_^

         However, I use this when I encounter a poker. Pokers use moves that will poke at 
         the opponent, yet are quite safe from counterattack because they have fast reset
         times. Most pokes consist of either ducking moves or quick high moves. Almost all
         mid moves are slower and heavier by comparison, so there aren't a lot of mid pokes.
         Putting the ducking moves aside, the high moves tend to consist of just one quick
         strike. A jab, or a quick kick. Therefore, the Parry is quite useful in gaining an
         advantage to counter-attack a poker, who by definition, is usually safe from
         counterattacks. The 1,2 jabs are effective pokes, but are dangerous because someone
         who ducks them will immediately launch the attacker with a rising uppercut. 

         Now, why did I put such a move right after the basics??? Well, this is basic, at
         least it must be basic for Jin players. Jin has to get close to attack. Many of
         his moves and especially his combos and launchers, require you to get up in the
         your opponent's face. You can do a couple of things, walk up to the guy and get
         smacked. Dash in and probably get smacked. Or wait for the guy to come to you,
         whereupon they've probably used a high priority move to smack you. Jin closes the
         distance gap by using moves. Either he starts to poke, sidesteps, dashes, or wave
         dashes. However, the parry, when used in conjunction with these will allow Jin to,
         not only close the gap but be safe from anyone who pokes at you. The parry will
         also be useful against guys like Law and Steve who have faster jabs when poking.


5. The Laser Series (b,f+2>1...)

   A very underestimated move in its basic form and "JUST FRAME" FORM.

   - 2 - This punch hits mid and knocks your opponent back whether it's blocked or not. Easy
         to anticipate and should therefore be used rarely. It is probably the most
         recognizeable move since it caused so many TTT players pain during cheese-Jin
         juggling. I've found that this ender will trackan opponent if he sidesteps and
         you delay the ender. Very useful in some situations. ^_^
   - d+2 - The third hit is an uppercut which launches, great if it hits but is also very
         recognizeable, however, just read on to find out...)
   - 2*  - Unblockable launcher. This move is great, up until the point when someone sees it,
         recognizes it, decides not to be a monkey's ass, and jabs you to interrupt it.
   - JF d+2* - To execute this, you can't delay the b,f+2,1,d+2*.  Release 2 when Jin's fist
         is about to glow.  If done right, the unblockable uppercut will come out
         immediately. Wonderful news for Jin players, terrible news for Jin opponents.
         Luckily, for all those complaining, the timing is very hard to master and can be
         flubbed even by the best of them, therefore, they won't get the quick unblockable
         whammy; they'll get the monkey ass-viewable slow unblockable move.

         Because more players can avoid the JF, you really ought to change up your Laser
         Series. The JF is too dangerous when connected so nearly every opponent will either
         try to jab or sidestep to escape it. This is your chance to break out the regular
         d+3 uppercut ender mentioned above. It is completely uninterruptable and will
         launch. It WILL hit people who try to jab, and many who try to sidestep too late.
         This is, in my opinion, just as good as a successful JF, and maybe better. Now that
         they have to worry about your regular d+3 ender, they ultimately must guess between
         blocking or sidestepping. Its a 50% gamble that leaves Jin much less vulnerable
         then his opponents. Also, if you end up fighting a guy who sidesteps the JF, just
         end the Laser Series with d+3 ALL THE TIME. He's honed his every instinct to avoid
         that move and will be VERY susceptible to regular d+3's. Add to this, that the d+3
         ender does not have a long reset time and you have a risk free move. Still, don't
         underestimate the JF. It's a man quick unblockable and even the best of players can
         get paralyzed when you use it. BY THE WAY, JF IS GUARANTEED ON COUNTER-HIT! ^_^

         The Laser Series has recently become the second most used move in my game. It is
         devastatingly simple, powerful and a bitch for your opponent to handle in all of
         its forms. SOME PEOPLE RELY ON IT COMPLETELY, BUT I WOULD LET IT LOOSE ONLY IN
         CERTAIN SITUATIONS AND NOT FREQUENTLY.


6. Electric Wind Hook Fist (EWGF) (f,N,d,d/f+2)

   A fast, strong high hook that sends your opponent flying. Has extremely high priority.

         This is very underused by most Tekken 4 Jin players. The two main reasons are; one,
         it isn't a launcher, two, it has a long reset time. But the flying animation and
         red sparkly things are just so cool, you know that there's got to be a way to use
         this move. There is one time when I use this: Right at the beginning of the
         match. If you perform the Wave movement just prior to the FIGHT! signal, and press
         2 right when the fight starts you'll come out with the highest priority move that
         you can throw at the beginning of the match, by any Tekken character, bar none. If
         someone tries to jab you, they'll get hit. If a King player tries to jump kick and
         lauch you, he'll get hit. If someone even tries to duck and poke, they will get
         hit. If they try to sidestep, unless they are in the middle of a sidestep during
         the FIGHT! signal, they'll get hit. If someone tries a throw, ... oh hell yeah.
         But use it rarely, because if someone blocks at the beginning of the match, you'll
         get hit. Also, if someone just plain ducks, without trying to poke low, they will
         avoid the high-reset time EWHF, and most probably counter you with a Rising
         Uppercut,... a launcher. However, everytime I've connected it, the opponent has
         never done a quick getup; its just so sudden. Use this to your advantage, to close
         the distance, get a few shots in while they're down AND REALLY SURPRISE THE SOCKS
         OFF YOUR OPPONENTS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MATCH. O_O !!!


7. Can-Can Kicks (d+3+4)

   A quick double kick; which hits mid on the first kick, then high. It hits the opponent
   straight up and is one of Jin's few launchers. Very underused and has an extremely long
   reset time. But we're Jin players, dammit, we're not afraid of that cause as Jin players,
   we don't throw out whiffing moves like monkey's asses! HOO-AH! However, you must be next
   to him because of the extremely short range.


         This is a move that you will use very, very, very, very, very, very often. I'm
         just sayin that because you will end up using this probably 4 or 5 times a match.
         You'll use it in four situations. One, when an opponent is rolling around on the
         ground. Because it hits mid first, you'll catch him with both kicks and most
         probably turn him over. Give him an extra sweep for good measure. The second time,
         is right after some Jab Strings. The opponent's only choice other than blocking is
         ducking and if you switch this in and out of your repeating Jab String's, you'll
         hit him every time he tries to duck. Thus major headache for your opponent. ^_^
         The third time, is the most often time you'll use it. You'll use it when you're
         very far from the opponent, about the distance equivalent to two dashes.

         Impatient Man: SAY WHAT?! R U BEIN A MONKEY'S ASS?! U SAID BEFO-
         Me: SHUT UP FOOL! I'M EXPLAINING DAMMIT! DIDN'T YOU LEARN THE FIRST THREE TIMES I
             WROTE THIS FRIGGIN FAQ?!?! O_o ?!

         You'll use it when you're anticipating a high priority high range move that moves
         the opponent forward. Like, Paul's Shoulder Rush (f+1+4) or Thruster (qcf+2), or 
         Steve's Low Sweeping Right or Hwoarang's Backlash (3~4). The thing is, those kind
         of moves are popular, especially with Paul and Steve. Especially so, when you're
         far away and they want to close the gap. When you expect this move, throw this out.
         Once you start it, it'll take higher priority over any of the previous moves and
         launch their monkey asses into the air. When I fight Paul or Steve, I connect this
         move at least 2 times in a SINGLE round. That's how dependent they are on those
         monkey ass moves. Think about it, twice launched in a round equals 50% damage. O_O
         
         * The fourth time you would use it, is to interrupt your opponent's repeated Jab
         Strings. Steve, Law, Bryan and others rely on pinning an opponent down with Jab
         Strings. Wait for the moment that they come towards you with em and bring these
         out. A d+4 doesn't have enough priority, your own Jab Strings may be beaten,
         sidestepping may not work, but this does. Trust me. Learn your opponent's jabbing
         strategies and use these to break him out of them.


8. Demon Sweep (d+4)

   A quick wide ranging sweep, that is mostly used for hitting someone on the ground. Use it
   against someone who is rolling around, who is taking a nap on the floor, or who is in the
   corner. Most people when cornered, panic and are susceptible to three sweeps in a row.
   But some of them will get smart and (1,2) you before you get the next sweep in. Yes this
   is susceptible to a counter jab. BUT, if they are cornered and lying down, then you have
   three sweeps PRETTY MUCH guaranteed. KINDA CHEAP... BUT WHY NOT?! O_o ?!


9. Demon Scissors (4~3)

   A move he kept from Tekken 3 that is slightly different now. He swings his hip around
   instead of flipping and the range is shorter. However, I find it to be more powerful now.
   Use it when a guy is takin a nap, is turtling, against Christie or as a good high
   priority high range move to close the gap. This move is susceptible to high pokes like
   regular jabs which will knock you outta the air. Therefore, a frequent poker makes this
   move useless!


10. Kazama Fury (1,3,2,1,4)

   You've seen it. 1 quick high jab, 1 quick snap kick up high, 2 quick mid jabs, then a
   quick snap kick down low. It leaves you standing and has a short reset time. Also, if
   they try to duck after the first 2 hits come out, they'll get smacked by the 2 mid hits.
   The combo is not interruptable.


         The use of this combo is when you successfully hit with the last kick. If it hits,
         it leaves the guy standing and cringing in pain. The animation is the same as when
         you've used King's Repeating Shin Kicks. The difference between the two moves, is
         that Jin's leaves you standing and within jabbing distance of your opponent who is
         stunned. This is the beautiful part! When you see that you've got the last kick in,
         which will always end up with the cringing stunned animation; you can do just about
         anything to your opponent.

         I strongly suggest throwing them. His throw doesn't change whether or not you press
         forward; it's the good old Reverse Arm Flip. The advantage to this, is it leaves
         your opponent lying on the ground closeby, which you just love because of your
         Can-Can Kicks, Demon Sweep or Demon Scissors. Also, the throw is so sudden, that
         only veterans and someone who's been playing you for awhile will break out of it.
         Did I mention the damage? 30% + any sweep you throw at him. Beautiful. If the guy
         is mashing the buttons to escape the throw you can give him a Rear Thrust (2,4)
         combo, (if the punch hits on a counter, you'll get the kick in automatically!).

         Recently, more people are able to recognize the special combo and will make a
         concerted effort to block downwards. Still, you must try this move at least once
         every match because you never know whether the guy could be a relative newbie or
         someone who is having trouble blocking low cause of a crappy joystick! This
         strategy is devastating to those two kinds of players! ^_^


11. Spin Heel Kick (b+4)

   A somewhat fast, strong, mid hitting backwards roundhouse. If connected, it will always
   send the opponent sprawling and rolling backwards. It pushes a blocker far away, doesn't
   move you anywhere and has a short reset time. One of the safest moves of Jin's arsenal.

         Use this in the same exact fashion as the third method of the Can-Can Kicks
         mentioned above. If you whiff, you're relatively safe. Also use this as a keep away
         move against frequent dashers, wave dashers and bulldoggers since you'll tag them
         if they duck.


12. Corpse Thrust (d+1)

   An extremely powerful single punch to the mid section. NOT SLOW AT ALL AND has great
   priority. Jin kneels on one knee to throw the punch, so at a certain point of the move's
   animation, you will completely avoid high attacks. If it connects, the opponent will be
   sent sliding back. If blocked, the opponent will be stunned momentarily. It has,
   officially become my favorite move. Honest!! O_O !!

         Again, use this in the same exact fashion as the third method of the Can-Can Kicks.
         Also, use this when opponents are getting up off the ground. MANY OPPONENTS WILL
         TRY TO DUCK DOWN WHILE RECOVERING, THINKING YOU WILL BE TRYING TO TAG THEM, WITH A
         DEMON SWEEP. BUT THEN THIS COMES OUT AND BAM! You will be VERY surprised, by how
         many times you'll connect this powerful move. IT'S NOT AS SLOW AS YOU THINK AND
         it's very hard to see it coming. Start using it and you'll start loving it too!
         Really! ^_^

         * I just wanted to add that this is an EXTREMELY underused move. But using it in
         the way I described and even as a changeup for regular poking is a must for
         advanced players. You won't see it used by a lot of people but to EVERY SINGLE
         person I've recommended this move to, have found it to be great also. Trust me. Use
         it, it'll save your life.

First of all, use those sweeps. Extra damage is crucial and every little bit counts since
you can't recover it anymore. Whenever, the guy is down, hit him again, most likely, they
are closeby, and if they're not, chase em down and throw out the quick Demon Sweep (d+4).

Second thing, try to corner your opponent. Putting them against the wall gives extra damage
to the attacker and on the recieving end, changes their recovery physics. They'll get up
accidentally, or just sidestep for no reason because they slammed into the wall. While
designed to somewhat balance the attacker's advantage, it is unpredictable at best and will
never really be fully understood until someone writes a FAQ about it. Jin's Jab Strings and
Kazama Fury are perfect for keeping them pinned in.

Third, throw your opponent. If they've been knocked down, and are rolling away from you;
well, just run up to them and throw them. When they see Kazama-Yama Boy running up to their
face, like a man with a mission, their first reaction is, of course, to block; and so those
people are going for a shoulder-dislocating ride. If they are smart enough to duck, then
alternate throws with Can-Can kicks, which will launch them. Jin's Can-Can Kicks must be
used if the opponent is recovering from the ground and ducking, shin kicking or sweeping.
Another side advantage to frequent throw attempts is that it will train you to keep two
fingers near 2 and 4. The same two buttons you use for parrying. AH-HA! Now parryng will
become easier to those who find it uncomfortable to use frquently. 

* However, many advanced players will know that escaping throws is an integral part of
upper-level play. What you need to do is switch up his throws. Luckily he's got the Throat
Smash (u/f+1+2) which requires a 1+2 escape command. It's relatively simple and doesn't
require a rolling motion of the joystick. Practice using it against the computer until you
figure out where exactly u/f is for this move. It's easier than you think, but without
practice, you may find yourself jumping up, and no one wants that. Switch up his regular
throw and this one, and you've got a rock-solid throwing game.

* Now,... how do you move around with Jin??? Should you sidestep a lot, dash a lot? Well,
to be honest, I let my moves move Jin around for me. His Jab Strings and Corpse Thrusts
move him around quite a bit. I'd advance only to bulldog and sidestep only if I knew that
my opponent was going to commit to a move. Overall, if you sidestep and do a lot of random
movements, you aren't attacking. Which is all that Jin should be doing. Nuff said.


****************
*4. A final say*
****************


Jin is still very powerful, but he's not cheese. Pressure them with your Jab Strings and
change up with your Laser Series. But if the opponent just ducks, sidesteps or pokes your
Jab Strings, you won't get anywhere. CHANGE UP WITH THROWS, DUCKING POKES AND CORPSE
THRUSTS. If they constantly jab you, you must use the Parry. His throws are perfect for him
because they leave the opponent closeby for a good old d+4. I cannot stress enough, the
importance of Can-Can Kicks. You must throw these out at certain times, as described above
to interrupt their move and launch them. You must use this move.

There's only one juggle you ought to use as far as I know. It's the easiest and one of the
strongest. Once they're in the air, 1, then (1,2,-4). It's easy, no EWHF'ing and its strong.
Most important, its diffucult to do a quick recovery off of it. Therefore, if you get this
juggle in, you will hit him back a certain distance, whereupon, you must run up to get right
next to them. During that running animation, because they couldn't do a quick recovery,
opponents must guess between whether you will just Demon Sweep them or change up between
Can-Can Kicks and Corpse Thrusts. Without that quick recovery diffuculty, certain distancing
and running animation, you lose a lot of Jin's changeup game. Other juggles are easy to
quick recovery off of and using the EWHF while juggling hits them way too far. That's why I
use this one.

* I know how hard it can be to take things out of long FAQ's. If I had to tell you only
three things: 1) Switch up Jab Strings and Alt Jab Strings as your main arsenal of poking
and pressure. 2) Make throw attempts frequently as they are the quickest way to big damage.
3) Third, use the Can-Can Kicks and Corpse Thrust A LOT. Trust me on this.
