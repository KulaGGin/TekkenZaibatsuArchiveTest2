Introduction
************
The Tekken series, especially Tekken Tag Tournament, is one of my all-time
favorite fighting games, right up there with SoulCalibur and Marvel Vs. Capcom
(which I suck at sadly). Tekken is an easy game to get the feel of and at the
same time, it takes a whole lot of time and effort to truly master the game.
This appeal to novices and seasoned experts produces a unique environment where
an upset is possible. Compare that to other fighting games where the balance of
power is clearly biased towards those who spend a lot of time practicing their
skills. I'm not trying to diss experts, but I like the excitement of having to
prove myself. I'm not saying an upset is always going to happen, but I believe
Tekken does reward strategy, but the game's easy-to-grasp nature doesn't
alienate newbies.

I wrote this FAQ to shed some light on Violet/Lee Chaolan. Long dismissed as a
weak Law knockoff, Lee started to develop his own style in Tekken Tag. Armed
with devastating and flashy moves, I saw Lee was a viable character in the
right hands. And so, the seed was planted. When Tekken 4 came out last year, I
was pleased they had improved on Lee's capabilities. Many months and countless
victories later, I felt it was my duty as a Tekken junkie to impart my
knowledge to those who are fortunate enough to buy Tekken 4 for the PS2.

Version History
***************
10:31 PM 9/5/2002 - Finished the VS. Strategies section and added the "Lee
Doesn't Suck" section to the FAQ. Whew! I think that's a wrap on Version 1.2.
Now... to get started on that Soulcalibur II guide. Which character should I do
it on?

9:09 PM 8/22/2002 - After a nice long break, I decided to press forward and add
some new features to the FAQ. Right now, I am working on the character specific
VS. Strategies section. More updates later.

2:01 PM 8/22/2002 - Completed the move analyses.

7:01 PM 8/14/2002 - Finished the movelists. I'll have to round up my buddies to
use as punching bags and collect data for the analysis. I hope school won't cut
into my playing time too badly. Anyways, I hope everyone's milked my fondness
for "Gilmore Girls" for all of its comical worth. Hahaha, enough already, let's
get to work!

11:58 PM 8/13/2002 - Began production of the FAQ. Poring over movelists and
thinking about how to lay out information is tough. Did anyone else see
"Gilmore Girls" tonight? I know it's a replay but... Hey! stop laughing! Even
the fiercest warriors have a tender side. And besides, Alexis Bledel is a total
fox!

Movelist
********
I'm hoping you understand the universal notation agreed upon by all Tekken
players. If you don't know, I suggest you hop over to Tekkenzaibatsu.com and
peruse their glossary. You will find it extremely helpful. But before we go,
here are a few short terms to take note of:

CHICKEN - to counter a REVERSAL. You need to take note of which limb was
grabbed and press the corresponding command. For example if a left limb was
grabbed, press f+1+3.
HMS - Hitman Stance. Lee's signature stance. Many moves can link to and from
this stance.
OKIZEME - attacking a downed opponent.
REVERSAL = Paul, Nina, Jin, and King are capable of reversing incoming attacks.
Counter reversals with a CHICKEN.
PARRY - to turn aside an attack to gain an advantage in frames. Law, Bryan, and
Julia are capable of parries.
SS - short for sidestep.
SSL - sidestep to the left.
SSR - sidestep to the right.

OK, that's about it. Away we go!

Hitman Stance Arts
==================
These attacks can only be done from the Hitman Stance. If you consult the above
movelist, you see there are many ways to link into this stance. By doing so,
you can play a lot of mindgames with your opponent. Lots of wholesome fun!

Throws
======
Wu Tip             2+4          Escape: 2
Lee grabs his opponent in a headlock and gives them a noogie punch. Yes, this
is the same technique Law has and a rather mundane one at that. Throws are
useful for people who turtle up. If they anticipate a high attack, you can
usually run up to them and throw them to break their guard. That'll show them.

Neckbreaker        F+2+4        Escape: 2
Another one of Lee's standard throws. This time, he grabs the opponent's neck
and slams them down with a swinging neckbreaker. Standard throws really suck in
T4 because you can break either of them by pressing 2. I would stick to command
throws to crack turtler's shells.

Knee Crusher       f,F+3+4        Escape: 1+2
The only command throw at Lee's disposal. The motion is quick and simple to
execute. Basically Lee grabs his opponent and drives his knee into their face.
Fast. Simple. Very effective with a two button break, although an expert will
be able to break this throw by quickly tapping and holding down 2 and then
pressing 1 with two held down. Despite this, you should be able to land this
throw frequently. To really make effective use of the Knee Crusher, you can
enter the command f,N,f+3+4. Basically, this allows you to take a Mist Step and
cancel it into the throw. As you can see, this extends the Knee Crusher's range
exponentially. Cool, eh?

============
Special Arts
============
1-2 Punch                        1,2
 = Violet Knuckle                2
 = Violet Kick [HMS]             4,[~3]
 = Mist Step                      ~f,N
A good ol', tried-and-true poking technique. This is probably your safest bet
as a good opening gambit since they come out reasonably fast. Not as damaging
as other combos, but fast enough to stuff any throw attempts, unblockables, and
some other stuff. Nobody's gonna psych me out by charging an unblockable. When
I see them go for it, I just run in there and give 'em two quick jabs. Combined
with the Mist Step, you can punch twice and then swiftly move in to close the
gap on your opponent. In addition, you can also link to other moves from the
Mist Step to throw off your opponent's timing. While they expect you to be
vulnerable while moving in, you can quickly cancel the step into another
attack. Another dimension to a simple 1-2 poke is you can throw in other
attacks and even link into the Hitman Stance, opening up more mindgames. Last
but not least, 1-2 Punches make great juggle fillers, although Namco decided to
tone down juggles. Damn.

1-2 to Silver Rain Kick [HMS]    1,2,4:4
Personally, I prefer the 1-2, Violet Kick link to Hitman Stance because you
throw out a mid kick which will push back any aggressive opponents. You really
have to be up close for the two punches to connect. Hitman Stance is best used
from just outside kicking range, so linking to it from this move puts you too
close for my taste.

Acid Rain Combo                  1,3:3:3
In this series, Lee does a punch, a head kick, followed by a low kick and
another head kick. The first two attacks hit high, which gives a beleaguered
foe ample oppurtunity to duck under your onslaught. Not very good. I wouldn't
throw this one out unless I had a total brain freeze and didn't know what to do
next. To repeat, stick with the mixups available from the 1-2 Punch.

1-2 to Violet Knuckle            1,F+2,2>2
Lee does two head punches, a body blow and a final head punch. The good thing
about this combo is the last hit can be delayed to confuse the crap out of the
other guy. Against anybody with a functioning brain and some skill, you should
cut this attack short on the body blow because an expert will wise up to your
mind games and duck the last punch. You should throw this out every and then to
poke somebody out of their rush or just to keep them away.

Fang Rush                        b+1,1
 = Triple Fang                   2
 = Hitman Stance                 3+4
 = Mist Step                     ~f,N
This is the meat and potatoes of Lee's punch strings. The Fang Rush opens up
with Lee striking the other guy's head with a backfist before hitting them in
the chest with another backfist. Because of the lunging motion Lee makes when
executing this attack, you can use this from a good distance away. You will
like this attack because it's fairly quick, covers a lot of ground and can link
into either the Hitman Stance or the Mist Step. Furthermore, you can execute
the Fang Rush straight from a block, making it a handy retaliatory move against
blocked moves.

Schwartz Rose Hook               SS+1+2
One of Lee's sidestepping attacks. Executing this command causes Lee to hit his
opponent with a quick hook punch. If timed right, it is possible to sidestep an
attack completely and score with this one. The range is a little lacking, as
you have to be pretty close for it to work. At the same time, it also hits mid
so you can duck it. Master this move and you got a solid counter.

Rave War                         2,2
Honestly, this move isn't so hot. Lee simply jabs his opponent in the head and
follows it with a backfist to the head. Both moves hit high, so it shouldn't
take a rocket scientist to duck. There are better punch strings at Lee's
disposal.

Rave War Combo                   F+2,2>2
A much better variation on the Rave War. Lee advances forward with a head
punch, body blow and a backfist to the noggin. The good thing about this move
is Lee moves forward while attacking, allowing you to close the gap between you
and your opponent or push them into a wall. The last hit goes high, so it's
best just to stop at the last hit. A very effective poking tool, though not as
fast as the 1-2 Punch or as versatile as the Fang Rush.

Right Cross                      SS+2
 = Mist Step                     ~f,N
Another of Lee's attacks coming off the sidestep. This time Lee throws out a
quick right cross which hits high. Although it hits high, the execution speed
is pretty fast and you can link to the Mist Step to set up some of your other
attacks. Mix this up with the Schwartz Rose Hook and the Screw Kicks to give
your sidestep some flavor. Remember, in T4, if you can sidestep like a pro,
then you can easily beat 75% of the people you face.

Left Screw Kick [HMS]           SSR+3,[~4]
Yet another sidestepping attack at Lee's disposal. The motion for this one is a
bit odd because you can only do it from one particular direction. Novices may
be put off by this, but a true master knows the value of this move. Lee does a
slow turning kick which hits mid and links into the Hitman Stance. Use this
from a good distance away, like when you're anticipating an opponent to run in
and attack.

Right Screw Kick [HMS]          SSL+4,[~3]
Like the Left Screw Kick, this can only be done sidestepping in a particular
direction. This version is slightly more powerful than the Left Screw Kick. My
advice is to either stick with one of these and memorize how to do it from both
sides of the screen or two memorize how to do both from both sides of the
screen.

Slicing Kick                    d/b+3
A good move to deceive opponents with. Lee takes a step forward and then uses
his left leg in a low sweeping motion to hit low. There's a little windup to
this move, but the kick itself is pretty speedy. On a counterhit, you'll cause
your opponent to shift to his/her side, setting up a side throw oppurtunity if
you're fast enough. Use this one occasionally because even the most dimwitted
opponent will wise up if you overuse it. You can also use the Slicing Kick to
tag grounded opponents.

Quick Silver Sting               u/f+3
A flashy move to look at and pretty good too. Jumping into the air, Lee throws
out a wicked cool sidekick which will knock down an opponent if it connects.
The only problem is the kick hits high and comes out pretty slow. Believe it or
not, there is a slower and more powerful version. My suggestion is to use this
one every now and then to throw your opponents off. You can also use it to halt
a charging opponent from long range. Don't go crazy with it though, OK?

Roundhouse                      d/f+3
The roundhouse is a pretty simple move that has many uses. Lee simply throws
out a roundhouse kick with his left leg. You can use this as part of your
poking game, to push an opponent away or to bait a chicken (more on that
later). The range is pretty good and even up close it's a good idea to throw
one out every now and then.

Split Axe Kick                  f,f+3
Borrowing a trademark move from his foster family, Lee steps forward and brings
his leg down with a crushing blow. Since Lee has few power moves besides this
one, I would use this attack at long range or to punish missed attacks. It hits
mid, so ducking opponents better think twice about crouching to avoid attacks.
You can also use the Split Axe Kick to keep grounded opponents from rolling
onto their feet.

Dragon Slide                    FC,d/f,d,d/f+3
One of Lee's sneaky weapons from the fully crouched position. Lee slides
forward baseball-style and trips up his opponent in the process. This leaves
Lee face down with his head towards his opponent, and it's possible to add a
sweep kick if you're fast enough. Throw this in with other mixups from the
fully crouched position to keep the surprise factor intact. Just keep in mind
you'll switch sides with your opponent. If you're comfortable playing from the
2P position, there's no need to worry.

Head Kick to Violet Hammer      3>3
Lee kicks his opponent in the head before using the same leg to deliver an axe
kick. Probably a good overall attack to use as a poke or if you have a brain
freeze and don't know what to do. As you can see, the last kick can be delayed,
which is useful in getting turtles to come out of their shells. The axe kick
hits mid, so even if the other guy ducks you can probably still nail them.
Don't too predictable using it, because a savvy player will block high or
attempt to reverse you.

Head to Step-in Kick            3,d_d/f+3
Similar to the Head Kick to Violet Hammer, Lee begins with a head kick. But
this time he steps in and throws out a side kick as a followup. The side kick
has more range than the Violet Hammer, so this is a safe bet when just outside
of punching range. The delivery of the last kick is somewhat slower, so be sure
to have a chicken ready in case of a reversal.

Acid Rain Combo #2              f+3:3:3
Not really a great combo to use because all three kicks can be blocked
standing. There are better kicking combinations to be had. Use sparingly,
unless you know your opponent sucks.

Mist Wolf Kick [HMS]            b+3,[~4]
 = Mist Wolf Combo              3
 = Mist Wolf Feint              ~3
 = Mist Wolf Trap               ~3,4(on opponent's block)
Although Lee has very few power moves, this is one and probably one of his best
due to its range and speed. There are a great many mixups available from the
Mist Wolf Kick, the most notable is the ability to go into Hitman Stance.
Ahh... all the mind games you can play with the Hitman Stance. Use the Mist
Wolf Combo against inferior opponents, because experts will be wise enough to
duck the last hit. The feint will probably fake out some people some of the
time, so throwing it out adds more dimension to the Mist Wolf Kick. Finally,
the trap is pretty tough to land. You have to press 4 at the exact moment your
opponent blocks the kick. Don't obsess about trying to land it. Instead, go
into the Hitman Stance after the Mist Wolf Kick and proceed to psychologically
mess up your oppoent's game.

Silver Low Kick                d+3,3
 = Violet Hammer               >3
 = Step in Kick                d_d/f+3
Leaps and bounds better than the Head Kick to Violet Hammer. The initial hit is
low, which is more than enough to throw off even the smartest players. Either
finisher hits mid, allowing you to hit crouched opponents. However, the Step in
Kick has more range than the Violet Hammer. Use it at range. Up close, finish
this combo off with the Violet Hammer. You'd be surprised how many times you'll
nail this move before people wise up to it.

Tsunami Kick                   WS+3,3
 = Step in Infinite Starter    d/f+3
 = Low Kick Infinite Starter   D+3
  = Rave Kicks                 3,3,3,3...
   = Violet Hammer Rave Kicks  u+3,3,3...
   = Low Rave Kicks            D+3,3,3...
THE most recognized and feared Lee technique. It is possible to kick
indefinitely, as the name implies, although it isn't wise to do so. There are
tons of mixups available from the Tsunami Kick starter and most achieve the
"deer caught in the headlights" effect nicely. Most people will freak out once
you start your barrage of kicks and will turtle up or try to counterattack. You
can either start the third kick low or mid, and it's a good idea to vary your
Infinite Starters to keep other players on their toes. Another plus is the
kicks are all done with the left leg, so buffering a reverse should always be
easy. Just be careful if you're playing against King. No matter what anyone
tells you, you cannot escape from his kick reversals.

Shredder Kicks                f,f,N+3,4
 = High Shredder Combo        >4
 = Mid Shredder Combo         >f_d/f+4
 = Low Shredder Combo         >d/b_d+4
Stealing a move from Paul, Lee charges in and delivers two mid-hitting
launching kicks and follows up with a finisher of your choosing. After the
dashing motion, Lee goes into the Mist Step, allowing to delay the actual
attack considerably and expand your range. For example, you can dash, count to
1 and then launch the Shredder or you can dash, complete a Mist Step and then
do the Shredder. Along with the Silver Knee, Hop Kick, and Blazing Kick, this
is a sound juggle starter.

Silver Sting                  u/f+3+4
The beefed up version of the Quick Silver Sting, except slower and more
powerful. This time, Lee does a turning jump kick aimed for his opponent's
skull. There's a little windup, so an alert player can probably duck or jab you
out of the attack. Thus, my advice is to use this when you anticipate an
opponent's attack. One more note, this is the only attack which will juggle off
the Scatter Blow from Hitman Stance.

Backflip [HMS]                b,b,N+3+4,[~3+4]
Highly useful to create some space between you and an opponent. I like to use
this to break away from an aggressive opponent or just to play mind games.

Delayed Dragon Slide          f,f,N+3+4
Similar to the Dragon Slide, you don't have to do this one from the fully
crouched position. The only difference is there's a delay because Lee stops and
turns around before sliding. I would recommend using this move at range, as a
mixup for the Shredder Kicks. Once you have the opposition anticipating the
Shredder Kicks, you can bust this one out for a low hit.

Shaolin Spin Kicks            4,3,4
Yet another set of moves borrowed from Law. All of the kicks hit high, so smart
players will duck or poke you out of your rush. Otherwise, the kicks allow Lee
to advance, allowing you to close the gap on the other player. All told, don't
go crazy with this one.

Roundhouse to Somersault      4,u+3
Lee throws out a head kick, pauses, then does a Somersault. The delay usually
fools people into eating the Somersault, so you can get away with abusing this
move to a degree. Throw it in with other kicking combinations to mess up your
opponent's timing. Too bad you can do any juggles from this move, because the
Somersault is one hell of a launcher.

Violet Spin Hammer            4,3,3
Similar to the Shaolin Spin Kicks, but instead of throwing out a final spin
kick, Lee drops his leg with an axe kick. Use this instead of the Shaolin Spin
Kicks. It covers as much ground just as fast and can't be ducked under.
Overall, a good move to freak people out.

Quick Somersault              FC,u/f_u_u/b+4
With all of that fancy motion, quick seems to be a strange description for this
move. Law can do this move with a simple u/f+4. But if you've set up your FC
guessing games fairly well, opponents looking for the Infinity Kicks and Dragon
Slide will never seen this coming. Otherwise, you might just be doing it by
accident, which can probably hurt your game.

High Somersault               FC,U/F_U_U/B+4
It's almost like the Quick Somersault, except slower and it doesn't launch. I
would stay away from this one and stick with the Quick Somersault.

Fake Somersault [HMS]         FC,u/f_u_u/b,[~3+4]
This move is probably one of those "Oh crap, I didn't mean to do that" moves.
Sure you can go into Hitman Stance, but that's about the only good point. Avoid
this one at all costs.

Silver Tail                   FC_d,d/f+4
In a fashion similar to move Nina has, Lee uses his entire body to sweep the
opponent of their feet. The sweep hits low and sets up okizeme pretty well. Off
the top of my head, the only two problem I cans think of are Silver Tail can be
countered with the universal low parry (press d/f) and you only knock the
opponent down on a clean hit. Nevertheless, when you combine this with Lee's
other FC attacks, you have plenty more guessing games at your disposal.

Hop Kick                      U/F+4
One of your go-to juggle starters. It's quick, and easy. You should spend a lot
of time practicing different juggles to find out which combos you're
comfortable with. Definitely bust out a Hop Kick after a blocked move. It has
great range but the recovery will leave you in a compromised position if it's
blocked.

Silver Knee                   u/f+4
Not to be confused with the Hop Kick. The motion is almost similar except it's
u/f and not U/F. Silver Knee is a decent juggle starter. What it lacks in
range, it excels in speed and recovery. This is definitely best used up close,
around punching range. Again, practice juggles so you know how to maximize the
damage you score off your opponent's air time.

Silver Whip                   f+4
Just about the fastest kick in the game. I use this attack to stuff any strings
and/or multithrow attempts. My only complaint is it hits high, but you need
Jedi-like reflexes to anticipate when a Silver Whip is coming. It's fairly easy
to abuse this move because a surprising number of people, and experts, will eat
this move. For all it's worth, the Silver Whip doesn't do much damage, but
since you'll be landing them often, all that tick damage really starts to add
up.

Violet Heel [HMS]            b+4,[~3]
Not exactly an "abuse me" attack, but effective when thrown out at odd
intervals. It's especially useful when you want to link into Hitman Stance.
What's even better is you can throw out the Violet Heel and follow it up with
either the Silver Whip, Violet Spin Hammer, or some other quick attack to throw
off you opponent's timing. Violet Heel is primarily used as a fast and easy
link into Hitman Stance. It can launch opponents, but only on counterhit and
most of the time you'll have gone into Hitman Stance before you can capitalize.

Violet Kick [HMS]            d/f+4,[~3]
Lee throws out his right leg with a front snap kick. It's not as fast as the
Silver Whip, but the ability to link into Hitman Stance is a welcome property.
From there you can wreak all the mayhem you want. This is a pretty good
interrupt against strings, but I prefer the Roundhouse to push people who are
too close.

Silver Cutter [HMS]          b,b+4,[~3]
It looks like the Violet Heel except it comes out slower and knocks down when
it scores. The Silver Cutter is an excellent defensive move because the initial
b,b motion means you backpedal a bit before unleashing a kick. It also tracks
sidesteppers well. Pretty useful when trying to play keep away with
overaggressive opponents. Links into Hitman Stance for more fun!

Rising Violet Kick [HMS]     WS+4,[~3]
Coming out of the fully crouched position, Lee hits his opponent with a kick to
the gut. It's similar to the standing Violet Kick. When combined with the other
attacks from the fully crouched position, like the Dragon Slide or Infinity
Kicks, it really shines in throwing off the other player's rhythym.

Blazing Kick                 d,d/b+4
A trademark Lee move, he whips out his right leg and sends the opposition
flying sky high into the air. If fighting didn't work out, Lee could always try
out as a kicker in the NFL. Haha. Seriously, pay special attention to where
you're fighting. In open areas, a launched foe will float much higher than any
other juggle starter. In closed areas like the garage or airport, they will hit
the wall and come crashing down sooner, enough to throw off your juggle timing.
Blazing Kick is a decent juggle starter, pushing back opposing players if
blocked. All in all, it's pretty safe, but I would recommend using Blazing Kick
at range or when you anticipate an incoming attack.

Machine Gun Kicks            4,4,4
The speed of the Machine Gun Kicks is impressive, but all three of them hit
high, which leaves you pretty vulnerable if your attack is ducked. Stick to
using the Shaolin Spin Kick or Violet Spin Hammer since they fulfill the same
functions the Machine Gun Kicks do. Still pretty useful if you're in a jam and
don't know what to do.

Laser Edge                   d+4
 = Machine Gun Kicks         >N+4,4,4
 = Shaolin Spin Kick         >N+4,3,4
 = Violet Spin Hammer        >N+4,3,3
 = Roundhouse to Somersault  >N+4,u+3
A low hitting side kick with many great mixups. This is a kick string you can
rely on heavily. The fact you can delay the next kick will give you a huge
advantage over the other guy. In fact, it's entirely possible to base your
entire offensive strategy around this string. The two best mixups in this
series are the Roundhouse to Somersault and the Violet Spin Hammer because the
former has a little delay before the Somersault. The Violet Spin Hammer can be
used to advance on somebody or to tag ducking opponents.

Laser Edge Rush [HMS]        d+4>4>4>4,[~3]
This is the move that will get you labeled "cheap" if you use it a lot. People
complain about this move. Why? Instead of bitching about it, why don't they
just learn how to parry or reverse this attack on reaction. C'mon you lazy
slapasses, it isn't that hard. All but the final kick hit low, so anybody who's
paying attention can see what's coming. Laser Edge Rush is very effective
against Christie scrubs or against any newbies. On counterhit, all of the kicks
will hit, making it useful in catching grounded opponents who're trying to roll
to their feet. But please, don't ever attempt this on an expert. They'll
quickly hose your attack. And plus, it insults our intelligence. Of course,
this is a great move to use to close out a match. Just because it'll label you
"cheap" doesn't mean you shouldn't use it.

Hitman Stance                3+4
Although perceived as a taunt, this stance actually has very good attacks and
serves its purpose as a psychological weapon. Basically, Lee rears back on his
back leg and beckons his opponent to attack. Against poorly trained opponents,
this might provoke them to overextend themselves in an attempt to nail you.
Fortunately, the Hitman Stance auto-guards high and mid attacks and you can
unleash lots of nice attacks of your own. Just be aware you can't defend as
well as you could just standing and your mobility is somewhat limited. Since
much of Lee's special arts link into this stance, I'll give this it's own
seperate section.

Mist Step                    f,N
 = HMS Cancel                b+3+4
 = Soviet Kick               3,4
 = Sway                      b
  = Code Red Low             4
Don't confuse this with Kazuya's move of the same name. Instead of sidestepping
like Kazuya, Lee crouch dashes forward. While not considered a true crouch
dash, it does slip under high attacks. Unlike the Mishima crouch dash, Lee is
considered fully standing after coming out of the Mist Step. I like to use this
manuever to close the distance and stay in an opponent's face. You can also
cancel the Mist Step with some other move; I like cancelling into the 1-2
Punches or the Laser Edge mixups. The Mist Step has also been beefed up with
new moves like the Soviet Kick and the Sway. The Soviet Kick looks similar to
the Shredder Kicks and launches. It's an effective juggle starter any way you
slice it. Sway looks like the head fake Nina, Paul and Bryan have, although
only one move links from it. I mostly Sway just to fake somebody out. I find
after pelting someone with enough Mist Step moves, the Sway does nicely into
baiting an opponent into a rash attack.

Silver Cyclone               d+3+4
One of three unblockables at Lee's disposal. It's essentially an unblockable
version of the Silver Sting with a ton of windup time. The chargeup time makes
this skill impractical outside of practice mode.

Power Punch                  d/b+1+2
 = Cancel                    u,u
I like to charge up the Power Punch and cancel it primarily to scare people.
This feint works wonders against turtlers, who try to attack when they see Lee
charging up. You can quickly throw out a Violet Kick, 1-2 Punch or Silver Whip
to stuff their counterattack attempts. Actually, the fake Power Punch is better
than the actual move itself.

Low Cancel to Silver Cyclone d+4,N+4,~3
I'm not sure if this is a glitch move because I've never done it myself. From
what I hear, the timing is somewhat tricky. If anyone can tell me about this
move, I sure would appreciate it.

10-String Combo              d/f+1,2,2,1,3,3,3,4,3,4
Everyone has seen this combo in some form or another because Law has the same
attack. As such, I doubt you will get anything past the first four hits in.
It's better to use the first four hits as a juggle filler or a counterattack.

=============
Hitman Stance
=============
Freaker Jabs                 1,1
 = Mist Step                 ~f,N
Lee throws out two quick backhands. I like using this move as a keepaway. Most
people react to the Hitman Stance by trying to rush in and land a hit. With
these two jabs, you can nail them in their folly. New in T4, you can end the
two jabs by going into Mist Step. I can't stress how neat this is. For example,
do Freaker Jabs, Mist Step and then come out of the step with a nice move like
the Violet Knee for a quick juggle. Neat, eh? If you're playing aggressive,
this is perfect for stopping a potential counterattack and closing in to press
your advantage. For those who are more content to hang back and play mind
games, which is what the Hitman Stance is all about, doing the Freaker Jabs
returns you into the stance for more wholesome fun!

Fake Freaker to Scatter Kick 1,3
As the name implies, Lee throws out a fake jab. Instead of punching, he
switches up the attack with a hooking kick. If you nail the kick on a clean
hit, you get a jazzy autothrow where Lee wraps his leg around his opponent and
drives their head into the ground! Just watch yourself because the kick hits
high and is pretty easy to block or duck on reaction.

Fake Freaker to Violet Kick [HMS]   1,4,[~3]
Yet another move stemming from the Fake Freaker Jab. Instead of doing the
Scatter Kick, a mid-hitting front kick is thrown out. Useful for faking out
people who duck in anticipation of the Scatter Kick. The best part is you can
return to Hitman Stance by pressing [~3] to continue your assault. It's
impossible to stay in the stance indefinitely by repeating 1,4,[~3], although I
wouldn't suggest doing that.

Fake Freaker to Scarlet Rain [HMS]  1,4:4:4,[~3]
I don't recommend using this move. For all the buttons your press, you pretty
achieve the same effect as the Fake Freaker to Violet Kick.

Scatter Blow                2
Probably the most used move coming out of the Hitman Stance. It's a spinning
uppercut which sends opponents flying. Unfortunately, juggling oppurtunities
are limited because the other player flys too far. The only guaranteed juggle
is the Silver Sting, making it seem like a "canned combo." If the Scatter Blow
is blocked, there's significant lag time, so get ready to block. Like I stated
before, this is a popular attack from the Hitman Stance; don't lean on it too
heavily.

Scatter Kick                3
Flashy describes this move the best. On a clean hit, you will get an additional
autothrow which is awesome to watch and humiliating for the opponent. It does
hit high, so a savvy player will duck or block it and unleash a counterattack
of their own. It's much more worthwhile to set this move up from the Fake
Freaker to Scatter Kick.

Ship Slicer                 4
The Ship Slicer looks almost like the Silver Tail. They both hit low and are
good to use at long range. The only difference is the Ship Slicer always knocks
down, which the Silver Tail only does on a clean hit. It's the only low-hitting
move that links off the Hitman Stance, and so should provide a good surprise
factor. Beware of abusing this move. The worst case scenario is to get parried
and suffer some form of abuse you can't defend against. Try to keep the
surprise factor on Ship Slicer fresh by relying on other attacks as your
primary method of damage dealing.

Hitman Step                 f
Tapping f allows Lee to take a small step forward while remaining in Hitman
Stance. This is a pretty good way to move into range for Ship Slicer or some
other jazzy attack. The step is really small, so don't rely on stepping too
much. Then again, if you need to do a lot moving to get into position, you're
doing the whole thing wrong.

Cancel to Standing          b
You cancel into the standing position. Simple. You can now go back to layin'
the smack down with your special arts.

Sidestep Walk               U_D
This move shares similar properties with the Hitman Step. It allows you to take
a small sidestep left or right. Like the Hitman Step, the movement is somewhat
small, so use this exclusively as a way to fine tune your position in
relationship to the other player.

Cancel to Crouching         D/F
As the name implies, this cancel leave you in the fully crouched posture. From
here, you can unleash a whole variety of attacks stemming from the crouch.
Infinity Kicks. Dragon Slide. Violet Kick. Also useful ducking under high
attacks.

Predator Step               u_d
THE best movement option available in the Hitman Stance. While remaining in
Hitman Stance, Lee takes normal-sized sidesteps. Not only does this move him
off axis, it also allows him to advance on the opponent. At best, you can
probably evade an attack and land one of your own.

****************
Lee Doesn't Suck
****************
Before we delve into the character specific strategies, there are some general
remarks I'd like to impart to you, my pupil. First of all, I'm glad you're
reading this FAQ. That tells me you're looking for something new in Tekken
besides using Kazuya, Paul or somebody else because they're easy to learn and
easy to win with. I gotta give you props for taking the road less traveled. Now
some general words of wisdom about Lee.

1) Lee ain't Law. Lee ain't Paul either. Lee doesn't have an easy executing
power move like the Deathfist nor can he juggle well. Your strength lies in the
speed of your attacks and the numerous mixups you have at your disposal. I
would advise you to take full advantage of them.

2) Playing Lee defensively is bad. As I alluded to before, Lee doesn't have
many power moves to fall back on. Lee's style is rapid-fire strings and fast
interrupts, so your best defense offense is a carefully planned and well
executed offense. Sure you could play as Bryan, block most of the time and then
bust out with a couple of Mach Punches to win, but this is a LEE FAQ. If you're
not pressing the issue with attacks, you should be trying to interrupt your
opponent's onslaught so you can resume your offensive.

3) Always have a plan. Never rush at an opponent without trying to figure out
what you plan to do next. Kinda like chess, only much faster-paced. My
philosophy is I attack to set up my opponent for another attack. If I score a
hit, that's just great. But the idea is to understand how to set up your
opponent for your other plans.

4) Pay attention! I know it sounds retarded, but sometimes I get busted for it
too. It's really easy to get carried away with your strings and then eat a
big-time ass whippin'. Take heed of your opponent's tendecies. We're all
creatures of habit. Find your opponent's and capitalize on it. Along the same
lines, study how they react to your attacks. Can they block it? Do they eat the
whole string? Or did they reverse it? By noting these things, you can gauge the
skill of the other player and give insights on how to proceed later on in the
match.

5) You can be flashy. You can win. But you can't always do both at the same
time. Lee's specialty is chipping away at an opponent's health. I know I'm
starting to sound like a broken record, but compared to King or Paul, Lee
doesn't have the capability to cause a lot of damage in a hurry. Never forget
that.

**************
VS. Strategies
**************
Now that you've learned everything there is to know about the various
properties and uses for Lee's attacks, it's time to apply them. In this
section, I will break down how Lee matches up with the other characters in
Tekken. I'll offer insights based on experience and suggest strategies to hose
the opposition. To make your life easier, I'll also list some key moves you
should watch out for. Finally, I've added my own personal ratings. Instead of
using a hackneyed star or number system, I thought it would be interesting to
liken each of the characters to a certain situation. For example, fighting Kuma
could be described as difficulat as getting a root canal. You get it right?
Here are some terms I'll throw out in the style descriptions. These definition
should give you an idea of what I'm talking about. Take note that sometimes a
character will fall into two or more categories.

offensively - also known as a "pitbull" or "bulldog." Characters used
offensively like to pour on the attacks, giving the opponent little oppurtunity
to counterattack. Examples would be Kazuya, Lee, and Hwoarang.

defensively - also known as a "turtler." Defensive characters play lots of
keepaway games, leaving you to screw up your rush. These characters usually
have high damage moves, which allow them to change the momentum in their favor

Any chain throw setup

How to win: There's a reason to fear the man in the jaguar mask. King has
inherited some of the late Armor King's moves to make him a more potent
opponent. While most people only associate King with his multithrows, a true
King expert knows better. King is adept at short, rapid poking strings and an
expert will use this to set you up for a whole multitude of chain throw
horrors. King has one of the fastest 1,2 jabs in the game and he will either
use that or the Low Jab Uppercut to keep the heat on you. Your paramount goal
is to keep your opponent off balance. The best way to do this is to out poke
King and stay in his face with firm, sustained pressure. Don't rush in wildly
attacking because you'll most likely get reversed or eat a big time attack. I
like to exploit the mixups I have at my disposal, namely the Laser Edge mixups
and the Triple Fang. By keeping the opposition guessing, you can divert their
attention from planning their attack to stopping yours. At range, be wary and
rush in when you see an opening. The Deadly Boomerang Kick is the hardest
hitting regular move in the game and walking into one really isn't helping your
cause out any. You want to keep King at around kicking range, just out of
Stagger Kick reach. If you're too close you could get Hop Kicked for a quick
juggle, knocked silly with a Super Kick or eat a CH Stagger Kick. For the most
part, you can stop crouch-dashes cold with a well-place Mist Wolf Kick, but be
prepared to break a throw. I recommend the 2,1,1+2 double tap because a
majority of King's throws break with either 2 or 1+2. You need fingers of
lightning to do it. To do the double tap, you press 2,[1],1+2. Simple right?
Obviously any opponent is less dangerous when they're in the air. Punish
whiffed and blocked attacks with a Silver Knee or Hop Kick to pop King up if
you're in range. Otherwise, go with the Mist Wolf Kick. Low hitting moves are
pretty useful against King, since he can only reverse high and mid attacks.
Sidestepping is also useful to get around King's attacks and set up your own.
Stick with the Schwartz Rose Hook and the Right Cross because the Screw Kicks
are slow enough to reverse, and you can't chicken King's kick reversals. Along
the same vein, don't become predictable with your kicking strings. It will be a
difficult battle, but if you pick your spots carefully, you can exploit your
speed advantage to triumph.

Donkey Elbow           b+1
Demon Gut Punch        WS+2
Statue Smash           d/b+4

How to win: Kazuya doesn't have very many moves; just the ones good at beating
you. You'll see a plethora of crouch dash mixups. Other moves which start with
an f,f motion can be buffered into a crouch dash, so be on your toes for a
buffered Stonehead throw. If you do get grabbed, press 1+2 immediately to get
out of it. Try not to overextend yourself attacking, because if you miss,
you'll be staring at the wrong end of the Shining Fists combo. Beat Kazuya at
his own game by unleashing a barrage of your own attacks. Your punch combos can
stuff most of his more powerful attacks. If you ever see Kazuya throw a 1-2
punch, your reaction should be to duck because he'll probably tack on the
Statue Smash afterwards. The deadliest move in Kazuya's arsenal is of course,
the Wind Godfist. It's the fastest juggle starter in the game. Once you do get
popped up, you'll be subjected to some painful juggles. Along the same vein,
avoid subjecting yourself to CH. If you're not careful a Demon Gut Punch will
throw you into a crumple stun and set you up for a world of hurt. Since the
crouch dash is so great at range, try to stay close to Kazuya. That way, he'll
have to rely on other moves to create some space. Your main goal is to pour on
the pressure. Kazuya doesn't have much in the way of defensive moves and you
can exploit this liability with a controlled flurry of pokes and custom
strings. By poking him out of his rush, you dictate the pace at which the fight
goes. Lee is a far superior poker, so throwing in short strings with various
attack levels works to your advantage. You can go into Hitman Stance because it
auto guards high and mid attacks. Since Kazuya has a condensed library of
moves, it's easy for him to get predictable. Don't hang back and wait; take the
fight to Kazuya.

Reversal               b+1+3_b+2+4

How to win: There are three flavors of Paul players. First you have the "I'll
abuse the Deathtfist" scrub. These chumps are easy to dispatch. It's possible
to sidestep the Deathfist, but in my opinion it's much too risky since it
tracks reasonably well. I prefer to block and counterattack. If you give little
oppurtunity to get Deathfist'ed, then you've eliminated 100% of the scrubs'
offense. This forces the chump to rely on other attacks, which in all
likelihood, they don't know. From there, you're free to beat the crap out of
them. The second variety is the reverse scrub. These morons like to turtle up
and reverse anything you throw at them. What they don't know is Lee is an
excellent character to bait and buffer chickens because a lot of his attacks
use the same limb more than once. For example, the Machine Gun Kick is just
4,4,4 so buffering a chicken is a easy as 4,4,[4]. Try to bait this scrub into
reversing. Lots of Machine Gun Kicks, Low Kicks to Violet Hammer, Infinity
Kicks and other simple attacks are in order. Getting chickened has a nice
chilling effect, and once they learn you know how to counter a reverse, they're
toast. Smoke and cook to taste. The final variety is the expert. An expert will
refrain from using the Deathfist unless you miss badly. They like the Falling
Leaf combos and throwing out short strings to poke you out of your game.
Fortunately, the Falling Leaf only knocks down on a clean hit, and if you're
any farther than punching range, that's not going to happen. As for the poking,
sidestep frequently to avoid the incoming blows. It's in your favor to
frustrate the other player with your rapid-fire combinations and juggles. Paul
doesn't have much in the way of low hitting attacks, so you can focus on
blocking high and mid.  The Silver Whip is excellent in breaking up rush
attempts and the Roundhouse can push Paul back and force him to come to you.
Any Shredder attempts can quickly be stuffed with a quick 1-2 Punch or Violet
Kick. You should respond to any blocked attack immediately with Hop Kick to pop
Paul up for a juggle. The less time he spends on two feet, the better. Keep
these points in mind and victory should be yours.

 = Sway            ~B
Uppercut           d/f+2

How to win: Nina is easy on the eyes but a tough customer in the right hands.
She is one of the best pokers in the game with her assortment of short and
confusing strings. If you whiff, there's a Bad Habit kick waiting for you. It's
not fun to get kicked in the nads. Fortunately, you can do something about it.
For all she's worth, Nina just doesn't have much in the way of power moves like
Jin or Paul. You, on the other hand have the Split Axe Kick, (Quick) Silver
Sting, Mist Wolf Kick, and the Screw Kicks. Hmmm... she only has the Blonde
Bomb and Bad Habit. I'd have to say six to two works in your favor. It's a good
idea to turtle up against Nina, but not to do it completely. Remember, Nina
still has those nasty chain throws to hose turtles. If you do get grabbed,
stick with the 2,[1],1+2 double tap to break free. It won't work all of the
time, just enough to save your ass. Fortunately, most of Nina's juggles,
however long they are, don't do so much damage. There are ample oppurtunities
to break free, usually when you fall back on the ground and Nina attempts to
scoop you up with a d+4,1. Try to alternate between tech rolling and staying on
the ground. In addition, the Divine Cannon isn't nearly as fast as it was in
Tekken 3. Now let's talk offense. Any damage Nina can deal out, you can too and
a little more. Play your strength advantage and pressure her with Triple Fangs,
Laser Edge Mixups, and 1-2 Punch mixups. My theory is if you're poking her, she
can't poke back. While you're at it, juggling her is the best way to gain an
advantage. Along the same line, perfect okizeme technique will keep Nina
grounded, where she's not as dangerous. Remember, when fighting Nina, you want
her 1) in the air or 2) on the ground. As always, buffering a chicken is
necessary to deter the threat of reversal. Just thank your lucky stars Anna's
not around, as she was more adept at staying in your face. Needless to say,
easy on the eyes, not easy to fight against.

 = Grounded            3
 = Flapjack Kick       3+4

How to win: Christie isn't exactly a brand new character, style-wise anyway.
She's basically, as one writer put it, "Eddy Gordo with great boobs." Umm...
right. Like Eddy, she's a favorite of button-mashing morons everywhere because
of the simplicity of her attacks. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure
out that Christie's attacks chain together beautifully and a lot of them
require kick buttons. I know the "Moves to watch out for" section may seem
short, but a lot of these moves link into a whole shitload of other attacks.
Why waste space stuffing a Christie FAQ in a Lee FAQ? My suggestion to you is
to peruse a good Christie FAQ to find out what she's capable of. If you want to
simplify things, a majority of her attacks either hit mid or low. So let's go
over how to beat a Christie player. There are two varieties, scrubs and
experts. If you're faced with a scrub, my first word of advice is not to
underestimate your opponent. My second maxim is to fight fire with fire. If
they're going to attempt to beat you with a barrage of Slippery Kicks, then get
cheap on them too. Repeated dosages of Laser Edge Rushes, Infinity Kicks,
Slicing Kicks and Silver Tails are in order. Remember, if they choose to play
cheap, that's an invitation for you to sink to their level. At least for me it
does. If there are scrubs, there must be experts too. Experts have a full
understanding of how each of Christie's strings link into other attacks. There
are two postions at Christie's disposal, Grounded and the Handstand. Grounded
looks like Christie is knocked down with her feet towards you. Don't be fooled,
there is a way to tell the difference. When Christie is Grounded her feet are
somewhat elevated and her head is raised. It looks as if she's doing a sit up.
When you determine Christie is Grounded, you have two options, hang back or
charge in. If you opt to charge in, a rapid-fire attack like a Low Kick or
Laser Edge can disrupt any mischief Christie is plotting. Most people choose to
hang back and let Christie get up on her on. It's recommended to vary between
charging in and staying back at odd intervals. Handstand position should be
easy to spot, unless you need new glasses or something. Don't try anything
fancy to bust up Christie because a lot of the moves in the Handstand can put a
big hurting on you. Stick with the Mist Wolf Kick or Laser Edge. Both are fast
enough to cut through Christie's strings. Above all else, stay patient. You
will have little, if any, oppurtunities to take Christie on standing up. When
she's standing, it's juggle time! Punish her with the baddest juggle you know.
That wasn't so hard, was it?

How to win: Yoshimitsu is a tricky, tricky sucka to go up against. Besides
Xiayou and Lei, nobody else can confuse you as well as the wily space ninja.
Namco decided to tweak with the speed of Yoshi's pokes, meaning the Savior Boot
and standing left jab aren't as scary as before. Nevertheless, Yoshi is still
an excellent poker and is devastatingly effective employing hit-and-run
tactics. In addition, he also has the Straight Uppercut, one of the best
launchers in the game (aside from the Wind Godfist) and good juggles. A good
Yoshi player will utilize his pokes to bait you into eating juggle after
juggle. The crafty space ninja is the master of confusion and you'll be banging
your head in frustration deciphering what he'll do next. His unpredictable
style and numerous unblockables will keep you on your toes all the time. In
addition, Yoshimitsu is disturbingly adept at keeping you on the ground. Many
of his moves can hit you as you try to roll to your feet or can quickly put you
back on the floor. I'm talking about Whirling Kicks, Spinning Kicks, Sword
Slashes, Flea Stances and Moonsault Slayers. No big deal, right? If you're
reading this FAQ, it shouldn't be. I said Yoshi is good poker, but I never said
he was better than you. Lee simply has the speed and priority to cut through
Yoshi's attacks. Play up your speed advantage by pressuring the other player.
As long as you keep the heat on, Yoshimitsu won't be able to hang back and play
his confusion games. Fast attacks like the Silver Whip and 1-2 Punch are your
go to attacks to poke Yoshi out of his strings. Why not give him a dose of his
own medicine? Retreat into Hitman Stance and force him to come to you and guess
what kind of junk you're trying to pull on him. Conversely, launch a bunch of
mixups at him and have Yoshi figure out what you're up to. If you can poke
effectively and correctly anticipate what sort of trickery your opponent is
attempting, this fight is yours to win.

Body Check             u/f+1+2

How to win: It's not very often you find somebody who will play Kuma, but that
doesn't mean you shouldn't take precautions to insure your victory. Kuma is a
great long range fighter because he has the longest arms of any character in
the game. Don't give him the range advantage by staying back. Instead, it's
best to stay in his face. While Kuma does have range, his moves lack any
serious speed and priority so staying on him should always be to your favor. Be
watchful for Double Claw scrubs. They only use one move, but try to vary the
timing with dashing and sidestepping. It's easy to block since it hits mid.
Other than that, the Demon Uppercut is a sneaky move which allows Kuma to move
under high attacks. Rather than try to poke him out of it, just block it since
it's easy to spot. Their Hunting Stance, which can be accessed after a Hammer
Claw or by pressing 3+4, offers a range of mixups and low hitting attacks. A
quick Low Kick should stuff any mischief they plan. In the right hands, Kuma is
a formidable opponent, but otherwise, he isn't so much difficult.

How to win: At over 75 years of age, Heihachi is easily the oldest contestant
in this installment of Tekken. Don't let his age fool you; Heihachi is a more
potent fighter than Wang (You remember Wang right? Man, he sucked in Tekken
Tag). Heihachi packs a pretty painful punch and can launch and juggle you in so
many different ways. The Power Punch is similar to Paul's except it comes out
faster and stings less. His Hell Sweep mixups are no fun to partake in and his
Demon's Breath attack is fast enough to stop most attacks. Don't fret, that's
why you're here; to find out how to beat him. Heihachi is still slow compared
to fleet-footed Lee and takes hits like a wuss. Sock it to your foster father
with rapid-fire pokes sprinkled with the occasional power move. Sidestepping
frequently and safely will get you around a lot of Heihachi's attacks while
setting up your own. The best way to hose the Hell Sweep is to be able to low
parry on reaction. If you can do that, it eliminates much of Heihachi's
guessing games. Aside from the Hell Sweeps, Heihachi doesn't have much in the
way of low attacks, so you can get away with blocking high to a degree.
Fortunately, juggles have been toned down greatly in T4, which was pretty much
old man Mishima's forte in Tekken Tag. In addition, his Hell Sweeps don't
always hit grounded opponents. Don't count on these revision to save your ass
however. You'll still need to play it smart to win. Except for a crappy right
kick reversal, Heihachi can do little to deflect incoming attacks, so buffering
chickens goes out the window. Stay on him like white on rice and you should
prevail.

Punch Parry            b+1+2
 = Mach Punch          ~2
Snake Lifter           d/b+2

How to win: Bryan is a downright scary opponent in the capable hands of a
master. He will pressure with all sorts of pokes and get you to panic. Then he
unloads with the heavy hits like the Mach Punch and his insidious juggles
caused by launchers, namely the Snake Slam, Snake Punch and Snake Lifter. Bryan
also has a pretty good crouch guessing games which are also available from his
QCF crouch dash. In addition, he also has a punch parry which chains into a
guaranteed Mach Punch if it the parry is successful. Not to worry, there are
weaknesses in Bryan's game. For starters, Bryan lacks much in the area of low
hits, which simplifies your blocking technique. You can afford to block high
and even the Snake Edge, Bryan's best low attack, has considerable windup. An
alert player can low parry and sting Bryan with a juggle or power hit. Bryan's
crouch dash is nowhere near as mobile any of the Mishimas, Hwoarang's, or
King's, forcing him to stay close in order to use his crouch guessing games. A
fast attack like the Low Kick or Laser Edge can quickly disrupt his crouch
dash. Keeping Bryan off-balance is the key to beating him. If you manage to
knock Bryan onto the ground, do your best to keep him there. Numerous Dragon
Slides and other low attacks are in order. Be careful though, Bryan is more
than capable of playing defensively. A few well-placed power hits will quickly
shift the momentum to his favor. Avoid overextending yourself and you will do
just fine.

How to win: I hate to say it, but the moves to watch out for section is far
from complete. Lei has a dazzling array of moves to confuse and hurt you and a
lot of them chain together into his various stances. Rather than formulate a
list ad nauseaum of key moves, my recommendation is to scope out a good Lei FAQ
(there are many) and study it carefully. When I say carefully, I mean to
actually take the command sheet, print it out and try them out for yourself.
Through firsthand experience you can observe each move's different properties
and links. Arm yourself with this knowledge, you'll need it. If you're a little
pressed for time, I hope the above list cuts it. As with any other tricky
character, such as Christie or Steve, the best way to cut through their b.s. is
to turn up the heat. If you don't give them space to set up, it'll be a nasty
poking war, which you have the upper hand in. Conversely, you can force Lei to
come to you. If he lies down, get the hell away and if he goes into a stance,
back off so he has to come at you. Force him to play guessing games from the
Hitman Stance and punish him for wrong answers. Guessing games from mixups are
also quite fun for you. The fully crouched position forces him to guess between
Somersault Kicks, Dragon Slides, Violet Kicks and Infinity Kicks. Here's a
quick description of each stance Lei has:

Snake - right foot raised, left arm bent mimicking a snake poised to strike.
Dragon - right leg hyperextended, left leg bent a bit, arms are raised with the
right arm higher than the left.
Panther - crouching with left arm extend toward you, palm down. right arm is
held close to chest, palm up.
Tiger - both hands are extended in front of Lei, mimicking a tiger's paws.
Crane - the Crane Stance, think "The Karate Kid" movies.
Backward - back is facing you (duh).
Drunken - left arm is extended and Lei shuffles around randomly.
Phoenix - left leg is raised and held close to chest, right arm is raised above
head and left arm is held close to chest.

One more word of advice, beware of a knocked down Lei. Recovery in T4 has been
sped up and even when on the ground Lei can tag you with a Rave Spin if you're
not careful. Never let up and be merciless in your assault. Be liberal in your
usage of the Triple Fang and Mist Step mixups to stay in his face. Now go out
there and win, win, win!

How to win: Julia is one tough (and disturbingly hot) fighter. This foxy mama
has a whole bunch of moves which can quickly change attack levels. In addition,
many of her moves link together, allowing Julia to string together lots of fast
attacks which will slowly, but surely, deplete your health meter. Julia thrives
on counterhits to do the heavy damage and she can accomplish this with ease
because her attacks have high priority. Here's a fact. Many people, even
experts, lose to a good Julia player simply because they don't know what to
expect. While most people study King, Paul, Christie, Nina, Kazuya, Hwoarang,
and Lei FAQs, few bother to study Julia. This ignorance will ultimately lead to
your downfall. It is my semi-sage advice to read a Julia FAQ so you can
understand the different ways her moves link. Once you got that down, it's just
a matter of reading your opponent's intentions and reacting accordingly. A
smart Julia player will try to pop you up with Julia's fast 1~1~1 or confuse
you with a whole crapload of mixups. Don't resort to turtling and trying to
read your opponent. Instead, attack Julia and react to incoming attacks
accordingly. I'm never comfortable playing guessing games, even though I have a
fairly accurate idea of what will happen. I'd rather limit the amount of mixups
I have to decipher by forcing my opponent on the defensive. Push Julia away and
make her fight on your terms. Violet Kicks, Roundhouse, Mist Wolf Kicks and
Laser Edge mixups will keep Julia a good distance away from you and allow Lee
to dictate the pace of the match. It's never wise to go head-to-head with Julia
because a lot of her better attacks also have good priority. Use Silver Whips
and Triple Fangs to bust up her strings and lay the smack down with Split Axe
Kicks and juggle starters. Keep patient because there will come a time when
Julia has overextended herself from a barrage of attacks. Julia also has some
degree of windup with some her attacks, so if you're feeling brave, you can
charge in and poke her out of it. Like Nina, easy on the eyes, but not easy to
fight against.

How to win: Man, Xiayou can be a tough target to land a hit on. In addition to
her regular sidestep, she also has a variety of dodges and assorted manuevers
to confuse you. You will hardly get a chance to fight Xiayou on a horizontal
plane, so do your best to keep her in your sights. She can't do much damage
except if she manages to string together many attacks (which she does well), so
you have the edge there. It would behoove you to read a good Xiayou FAQ to
understand what she's capable of. Although Namco tweaked juggling in T4, she
still manages to keep you in the air rather well. When she's in Rain Dance
Stance, charge at her with caution. Although her back is turned, she can still
make you pay dearly for your reckless aggression. The Art of Phoenix is just as
tricky. A swift Laser Edge will knock her out of it. Darting in and out of her
range is espcially effective and learning how to sidestep effectively will hose
Xiayou. Now that there are walls in the different stages, focus on pinning her
down so she has limited room to manuever in.

Parry              b+1+4_d+1+4

How to win: Experts and novices alike agree, Law can kick ass. Good speed and
strength combined with ease of use makes Law a nightmare to play against. Most
of Lee's moves originate from Law, so some of the stuff he throws at you
shouldn't be foreign. If you're thinking Law and Lee are alike, think again.
Law is a character who thrives on power strikes and juggles. Lee is more of a
pressuring type of attacker who excels at confusing the opponent with his
mixups and pokes. The main thing you want to take note of when fighting against
Law is to beware of his Dragon Storm and Junkyard Dog combos. These are his
go-to strings and it is imperative you learn the difference between the two.
Any time you get block, you can bet your lunch money he'll attempt to
counterattack with either Dragon Storm or Junkyard Dog. Another bad thing is
the Low Punch to Flip. The jab is pretty fast, allowing Law to interrupt your
attack and bust out a hurtin' with the Flip Kick in one fell swoop. Try to
alternate between slow and fast hitting moves so he can't rely on his parries
too much. Now that Law has two different stances, you should also learn how to
distinguish between the two. Personally, I've never seen them, since most
people like to play Law straight up Tekken Tag style. Pressure Law with your
best strings and keep the heat on. You never want your opponent to dictate the
tempo at which the match goes. In my opinion, you should keep Law at kick
range, since many of his best moves are punches. Infinity Kicks, Mist Wolf
mixups and other moves should keep him at bay long enough. Be patient and never
try to force anything. Your best strategy is to employ a balanced mixed of
turtling and rushing. Good luck!

How to win: I know what you're thinking. "Dude, what the hell is a Hwoarang FAQ
doing here?" Well, hate to say it, but it needs to be here. Hwoarang is one of
the most complex characters in Tekken and this list is only the tip of the
iceberg. OK, I'm going to give you a moment to catch your breath. Got it? Good,
let's go. It's easy to notice Hwoarang's primary attacks stem from kicks. A
good Hwoarang player will use his punching strings to set you up for his more
lethal combos. Otherwise, a vast majority of the Hwoarang users are button
mashing idiots. Try to spot the difference between the two. Hwoarang is
comfortable with keeping the heat on you with flurries and flurries and
flurries of strings and combos. As such, in conjunction with his confusing
stances, makes him a formidable fighter. The first order of business is to
determine which stance he's in. Take note of which leg is facing forward.
Here's the short and sweet. If Hworang is in the 1P position LFF is when he's
facing you (as the player looking at the screen). In 2P position, LFF is when
his back is to you. His Flamingo Stances are easy to figure out and he can't
block while in them. Nevertheless, caution is the better part of attacking
because Bob can still bust out some sick attacks. The best way to counter
Hwoarang is to close the distance on him. As a kick-based figher, Bob needs
some room to operate. If you can stay uncomfortably close to him, as in within
punch range, you can poke him out of a lot of stuff. In terms of blocking,
Hwoarang has hardly any low attacks, so you should can block high. If you can
anticipate your opponent's intentions, ducking under high attacks on reaction
will ease your fight. The three keys to beating Hwoarang are staying in his
face so he doesn't have operating room, keeping him on the ground, and never
attacking recklessly.

How to win: Craig isn't a very popular character at the arcades, but then
again, people can be strange sometimes. The Vale Tudo master is a scary
opponent to behold and his rough-and-tumble style suits him perfectly. If you
don't know, Vale Tudo is a combination of Japanese jujitsu and Brazilian
streetfighting. It was developed by the Gracie brothers and is a common (and
formidable) style in the UFC world. The power of Vale Tudo is so awesome that
the US even has
certain aspects of the art taught to its elite military forces, namely the Army
Rangers. If you're fighting Craig, expect a lot of your fights to end up with
you on your back with him on top, trying to pound your face in. Since you like
to do a lot of your fighting standing up, this can't be good. It's best to
understand which moves allow Marduk to Mount. Even then, the fight's not over.
If Mounted, Marduk can throw up to four punches at you in any order. For
example, he can go 2,1,1,1 or 1,1,1,1. The possibilities are endless. To combat
this, you need to be alert. If he swings with his left, you should press 1+3
and 2+4 to block a right punch. Sometimes, Marduk gets sneaky and press 1+3 or
2+4, which sneaks past your defense. To combat this, hit either 1 or 2. Outside
of tussling around on the ground, the best way to take Marduk on is when he's
on his own two feet. Pressure him relentlessly with mixups; your speed is much
superior to his. Don't anything foolish or too risky unless you like winding up
on the ground. Be patient, Marduk's lack of speed means he get overextended
pretty easily. Just try to stay on your feet OK? You should do just fine.

How to win: Another popular T4 character. Like Paul, Steve is powerful and easy
to use. Steve has great poking speed and plenty of fast, hard hitting attacks.
With his bob-and-weave style of fighting, he can fake you out of your shorts
faster than you can say, "What the hell?!?" There are two types of Steve
players, mashers and experts. Mashers like to abuse the Short and regular
British Edges, usually ending it with the Low Sweeper. Twin Jabs also come out
a lot along with random Weaves, Ducks, Spins, and Sways. In short, with all of
this button mashing, expect to see a constant blitz of attacks. Attack whenever
you find an opening. Beat a masher to the punch by unleashing some cheapness of
your own, namely Infinity Kicks, Laser Edge Rushes and whatever else you think
is cheap. The sky's the limit and it's only fair to give a "cheap" player a
dose of their own medicine. The difference between a masher and an expert are
almost imperceptible but the key is the pace at which the match goes. An expert
understand he can unload a bunch of attacks in a hurry, but knows better.
Instead he will play Steve like a true boxer, dictating the tempo with pokes
and interrupts and then going all-out in short assaults when he finds an
opening. It's difficult to outpoke Steve, since a lot of his moves are fast and
have high priority. Instead, rely on a mixed blend of turtling and rushing at
the appropriate times. By keeping him out of his optimal range, you can really
take the teeth out of an opponent's attack. Strive to keep Steve out of his
punching range, but close enough for you to kick him. Steve doesn't have a lot
of low attacks or okizeme game, so if blocking and getting up should be simpler
compared to other characters. In addition, he's vulnerable to attack when he's
bobbing, ducking or weaving so a well-placed strike is more or less guaranteed.
It's best to foil his trickery with a fast attack, since the main purpose of
his feints are to bait you into eating counterhits. Be patient and time your
rushes carefully.

How to win: Take everything you knew about Jin from Tekken Tag. That's right,
everything. You got it all? Good, now throw it out the window. Jin is back, and
with a completely revamped movelist. You won't see Shining Fists, Demon Steel
Pedals and the like anymore. However, Jin retains his Electric Wind Godfist
(renamed Electric Wind Hook), Laser Cannon mixups, and Demon's Paw attacks. At
least you know what those look like. Jin has shifted from being a finesse
character to more of a power fighter. You'll see plenty of Jin players at your
local arcade, so you'll quickly get acquainted with his style. To sum it up,
Jin can bring it, and bring a lot of it. Jin is still one of the top-tier
offensive pokers in the game and can mix up his attacks as good as Lee. So
where do I begin? Lee has a speed advantage over Jin and can pretty much poke
him out of his strings. The best way to do so is to study your opponent's
tendecies. If they start with the Laser Cannon, it's best to just block it all
because the other two hits can be delayed and really mess you up if you get
hit. Fake Jin out of his shorts with your insidious mixups. Sidestepping
frequently will help you get out of harm's way, if you can do it correctly. One
thing to take note of is Jin players like to keep the heat on you with a
continuous rush. Let him know you mean business some of your best and baddest
strings, juggles and stuff. It's really hard to get away from Jin because his
Crouch Dash covers so much ground. Conversely, you too can chase a retreating
Jin with Mist Step. Don't become too predictable with your attacks because Jin
still has that parry you should worry about. A well-played Jin is hard to
overcome, so you'll need to bring your A game and minimize your mistakes.

======
Combot
======
Style most often used: anyway possible

Moves to watch out for: depends on which character its mimicking.

How to win: Combot is the equivalent of Tetsujin/Mokujin from Tekken Tag. It
can mimic and character's style although some moves have different properties
because of Combot's size. This is especially true if Combot is impersonating
Kuma because it doesn't have the range benefit like he does. Be wary of a
person who chooses Combot. They might be a) a fool who has no idea what they've
done or b) a seasoned pro who has a deep understanding each character's
different nuances and styles. So you should either be frothing at the mouth or
soiling your shorts. Don't be quick to judge your opponent. Wait until after a
round or two. A novice will usually turtle and attempt to decipher which
character Combot is. Why don't you make things harder for them by turning up
the heat? Go crazy with your best and flashiest attacks. An expert, on the
other hand, will most likely know what character Combot is emulating and play
accordingly. Since the element of surprise is in your opponent's favor, I'll
try to do my best to eliminate that advantage. The trick is to read how Combot
is standing during the pre-fight sequence. Here's my best shot:

Lee - standing in a relaxed guard position. Both hands are at around waist or
stomach level.
King - one of the easier ones. Standing in guard position with both hands
reared up like a boxer. Bobs from front to back rather conspiciously.
Lei - also fairly easy to spot. Shuffles to the left and right. If at any time
you see the Razor Rush step during the pre-fight sequence, you should have a
pretty good idea of what to expect from your opponent.
Yoshimitsu - if you can't spot this, I suggest you get some glasses, man! He's
holding a goddamn sword for cryin' out loud!
Nina - stands with her arms out from her body. Both hands are open as if she's
going to do a double karate chop. If you look closely, her arms move in sync as
she bobs.
Hwoarang - looks like King's except he isn't semi-crouched like a boxer. He
bobs up and down rather than from front to back. If he busts out with a stance
change... then uh... Combot is impersonating Hwoarang.
Kuma/Panda - pretty easy. Doesn't stand in guard position. Arms are down by the
waist and Combot is hunched over, kinda like a bear standing on two feet. Duh!
Steve - similar to King except when he bobs, he twists his chest from side to
side.
Heihachi - one arm is out and away from the chest in the open position, as if
to deliver a karate chop. The other arm is close to the chest open and facing
palm up. Notice the wide stance adopted by the legs and feet.
Bryan - it's a pretty macho looking stance. The left hand is down low by the
waist, while the other hand is close to his face.
Law - another easy character to recognize. Bobs in place while arms are
shifting alternately from face level to abdomen level.
Julia - her feet are spread far apart and is sort of leaning forward. The left
arm is out at shoulder level while her right arm is close to her left elbow.
Ling Xiayou - weight is shifted to the back leg. Her stance is similar to
Nina's in terms of the position of her arms.
Jin - very difficult to spot right away. Looks like a regular guarding stance,
nothin' special.
Paul - similar to Jin.
Kazuya - similar to Paul, who's similar to Jin. These last three will give you
trouble.


***************
Closing Remarks
***************
I hope you learned something from reading this FAQ. Some people attempt to
dismiss fighting games as mindless button-mashing, but I digress. As you can
see, it's more like a science that can be studied. And as with all sciences,
numerous trials and errors are needed to come upon the winning formula. I think
the guys at Namco did a marvelous job with the fourth installment of the Tekken
series. They managed to throw in some new innovations and characters, while
keeping enough of the "same ol' stuff" to keep long-time fans such as myself
interested.

Hopefully this FAQ is sufficient enough to vastly improve your mastery. There
is no substitute for practice. It's one thing to go through this FAQ and decide
in your mind which moves are the best. I know I've tried to make correct and
factual analyses, but ultimately, you, not me, will be playing the game.
Nothing can ever be simulated to perfection. It's better to go to your local
arcade and practice what you've learned. Not only will you understand what
works and what doesn't, you'll also remember more and you won't need to bring a
sheet with commands written down every time you play.

In summary, there are three points I want to elaborate on. First, I've done my
best to dispel the myth that Lee is an inferior Law clone. Nothing could be
farther from the truth. While it seems easier to gain mastery over characters
like Bryan, Kazuya or Jin, Lee has a pretty steep learning curve which will
reap massive dividends once you get it right. Second, there is no such thing as
an all-powerful character. Each character has distinct strengths and
weaknesses. If you suck, you only have your lack of practice to blame. Finally,
don't be afraid to lose. That may sound antithetical to what I've written so
far, but every match is a learning experience. You should always look for
things you do well, things you don't excel at, and areas which need
improvement. I wish you all the best in your pursuit of becoming the King of
Iron Fist. Good luck!

Thank you's and dedications

To those who perished in the tragedies of Sept. 11, 2001 - This tragedy has
helped unite a nation long disaffected with prosperity and self-absorption. To
all those radical leftists, I must chastise you for trivializing these people's
deaths as nothing more than a means of protest against US policy in the Middle
East. You don't understand how terrorists think and nobody should be wasting
time trying anyway. God bless those innocent souls, they will not have died in
vain.

To the men and women who are serving in the Armed Forces - You are willing to
make the ultimate sacrifice to defend the values which make this country great:
freedom, liberty and equality. I salute you and wish you a successful mission
and safe return home.

My family - First and most importantly, to my family, without who I wouldn't be
the person I am today. Heck, I wouldn't even exist. My parents, brother and
sister have been constant presences in my life and I imagine I would be a much
worse version of my current self without them.

Namco - For creating the most ass-kickin'est game in the recorded history of
games. I salute you for you efforts!

TekkenZaibatsu.com - If you need movelists, you got 'em right here! Where would
I be without this valuable resource?

GameFAQs.com - An excellent site, for the people and by the people. If you ever
need help in a game and don't want to shell out $15 for a game guide, this
should be your first stop. You can also catch up on the latest gaming news
here.

Whoever translated the Sega game "Zero Wing" - I pity the fool for
unintentionally creating one of the most hilarious Internet phenomena! You have
to watch the goofy music video to truly grasp how badly "Zero Wing" butchered
the English language. Besides, I have a pretty cool pen name now! Someone set
us up the bomb! Hahahahahahahahaha...

All my favorite bands - The White Stripes, Coldplay, Foo Fighters, P.O.D.,
Garbage, The Strokes, The Hives, U2, and yes, even Elvis Presley for providing
excellent music while I wrote up this FAQ in the wee hours of the morning and
late afternoon.

Various "lad magazines" like Stuff, FHM, MAXIM - These magazines make it OK to
act like guys. All this politically correct nonsense has to stop! And besides,
no other magazines do a better job putting famous gals like Katie Holmes or
Kirsten Dunst in tasty pictures. Keep up the most excellent work!
