Why read this in the first place? Yeah, out of options. Anyways, if you think
you're good but you lose fight and say, "Hey, I should have won this fight!", then,
this is for you. Also, if you're just new to this game, this is also for you. 
And if you think you know it all...guess again. 
JUST READ ON!!!

I have one clear purpose - to make people who believe that ssing is nothing have 
faith in it. I was amazed in a forum I was in that this guy didn't give value to 
SSing. As you go through this guide, I'll try my very best to make you see how 
important SSing is to the game. I won't be biased either. It's not because I am
making a SS guide means I'll be giving or focusing the center of all attention to 
this game play system. NO. In fact I'll try to cover up some of the basics as much 
as I can. But forgive me as of now because I went through a lot - licensure exam, 
a year without Tekken, re-entering newbie status, catching up on my long lost 
tekken skills, and I'm studying programming languages right now.

Guess what? If you think SSing is a thing of the past, like something you burried 
along with past, unneeded skills from Tekken 1 up to Tekken Tag, you're dead wrong.
As a matter of fact, some players still are juggle oriented. I mean, all they do is
try to get a juggle opportunity all day long and then think in the end about how
they lost the game. As they say, "...T4 is a slug fest". 

So where does SSing come in? 

SSing is, still, very much an integral part of Tekken. And it's without a doubt one
of your best buddies, along side the new game play system, which I will discuss 
later. It has been given real-like properties as in real life fighting situations.
Given that fact, you'd have to use that to your advantage. As a tekken player, you
must be able to come up with a complete, solid game every time you play against 
someone or if you play in tourneys. Playing in a straight-line, 2D format restricts
your options. The only way you'll set yourself free is to go with the 3D option 
fighting tools you have presented to you.

 Tekken 4 SSing                                               **  **  **   ***
************************************************************ **ekken **    * 4

Side stepping for Tekken 4 has changed dramatically. If you think SSing for TTT was
a blast, think again. Anyways, I may seem like I'm blowing off here but just to be 
in the middle of everything, there are some restrictions, kind of the things which 
can't be done by the side step. 

As in any move, SSing also have properties which are very useful if you gain 
familiarization on how to use such properties. When you are told to SS either 
right or left, it literally means to your character's right or left. 
In Player 1 position, a SS to the right directly translates into a SS to the 
screen or away from the background.

DEFINITION



BKs stands for  back turned sidestep. It basically does the same function 
but the scope of the step you make is less compared to a normal one. 

armslength (characterwise) only denotes that the distance from your 
character to your opponent's is just an armslength of the average Tekken 
character.

Wrong way SS is a term for a SS done the opposite direction of the right way to 
SS an executed move. This is the hardest, trickiest SS move to pull off as perfect
timing and excellent perceptual speed are needed. This is the ultimate reward 
for knowing and understanding the properties of any given attack. I seldom pull 
through with this move so I instead use the regular one.


Effective range of throwing is an armslength from a regular character's 
outstretched arms. Basically, you can throw your opponent if both of your
characters fists get close; the leading fist of an opponent's character is 
enough to consider a throw. The distance of throwing prowess can go farther 
depending on the situation.

Walking is...walking to your character's left or right depending on where you
hold the joystick or press the dpad. 

Auto SS this is the ability of any character to SS any succeeding move of short
or ten strings prior to blocking any hit from the string. Using the concept of 
the Auto SS requires familiarity of string you are blocking since if you choose 
the wrong path to auto SS, you will get hit.

TOP VIEW DIAGRAM        COMMENTARY

*****************
 Start of match/        This is the intial position at the start of a
 Mobile position        match. It would be typically be around two-arms (AL)  
*****************       length in distance. If you SS in a start of a match,
P1 side   P2 side       say you successfully did, you can advance an AL and
                        grab your opponent. It's quite annoying.
      _   _             Anyways, the important about knowing your distance   
     O_   _O            from your opponent is the fact that it determines 
                        the type of move you'll execute.

********************
 Normal Sidestep(SS)    After doing a full, complete SS, you'll end up close 
********************    to your opponent's side. The distance is about 1/6 of
P1 side   P2 side       a complete circle or 1/3 of a half-circle. Please take
                        note that it does not completely place you adjacent
      _                 to your opponent at a 90 degree position with respect 
     O_                 to the start of match or mobile/standing position.
       \                What happens next is that you are drawn closer to your       
       \O               opponent. 
                        It is only a matter of opinion whether you are in a 
                        tight situation or a good one. If you know what to do                  
                        next, which I believe you do, you can punish your 
                        opponent no matter how fast a move is dished out.
                        After a successful SS from an opponents attack, even 
                        if he tries ducking and retaliating, you'll get him with 
                        a throw,a fast one for that matter. Just take note of 
                        recovery times and you're on your way. 

SS is the abbreviation for the word side step. It is done by TAPPING, just tapping,
the dpad or the controller either up or down allowing your character to move to 
the right or left with reference to where you are tapping at a certain position,
either in the beginning of the match or in the match. 
SSing for T4 is faster and has better evasive properties as well as being a 
better, offensive and defensive in-game strategy. 
********************
 IN-GAME PROPERTIES 
********************
In-game properties for the SS changes. You are now ALMOST adjacent to your 
opponent's character if and when you successfully SS an opponent's attack. That 
means a lot. Being almost at a 90 degree curvature gives you a lot more options and
evation perks. In short, you have the frame advantage in the situation. I'll discuss
that later. 

******************
 Stopped Sidestep       There are distinct advantages of ST that are 
******************      completely unknown to many. But the timing is 
P1 side   P2 side       difficult. 
                        I have a simpler example than what I gave before.
      _                 I want an example that covers much of what I said.
     O_  \              You are faced with an Paul user. Your opponent attempts 
         \O             to execute a DF. It is an attack needing to be evaded 
                        to you right. But he also has the option to do a 
                        a RD+1, Paul has about 3 moves coming off the RD. The 
                        RD+1 can be SSed to the left. If you think about it, 
                        choosing to SS left is basically good. The reason for
                        such is because you can perform a stopped SS. You can 
                        press b for defensive purposes and you will be able to
                        evade both attacks given that you did right with the  
                        timing. But I suggest you do a  stopped SS by executing 
                        a throw ASAP. This is because you will out prioritize
                        both moves as you will catch the opponent as the 
                        character is in the frames of executing the move and 
                        gain about a neat 30+ points of damage off your opponents
                        life bar.
                        Before I forget, you end up still in front of your 
                        opponent but slightly on the side facing the former if 
                        you decided to push b. The only reason you'll tap f is 
                        because you are faced with someone you're wasting time 
                        against.
                        You may also link this move to a Position change. It's quite
                        neat doing it against the DF. Since the DF is quite slow, 
                        you may opt to do a stopped SS to your CHARACTER's RIGHT
                        then immediately do position changing as Paul finishes off 
                        the DF. 
 
Stopped sidestep is accomplished by pressing f, b within the frames of completion of 
the actual SS. Such SS has distinct advantages like being able to SS a move to the 
wrong side while anticipating the move you actually intend to SS. The properties 
which a stopped SS has is the same as a wrong way SS although the latter is much 
more complicated. A stopped SS can also be done by executing moves immediately 
after the SS - f, b, CD, SS, U, D - almost any move.

********************                        
 Wrong-way Sidestep     A good example would be that of Kazuya's TGF. If a Kaz
********************    user doesn't know how to delay and time the execution 
P1 side   P2 side       of a TGF, a wrong way SS will evade the attack. 
                        If you notice a TGF dash, you can SS right. It will 
        _               sometimes involve a ST at first followed by a SSw, 
       O                that's if the opponent delays his CD attack upon the 
        \               situation. This is very dangerous to do especially 
        \<-- look here  if you don't usually do it and know of the timing of 
       \O               when to SS. A single SS will also do but is very, very 
                        risky.
P1 strikes right while  Try this experiment. At close range, you can SS a TGF
P2, at CLOSE distance,  to the right if you execute the SS the same time the 
SSs left, which is the  CD progresses into a TGF.                         
wrong way of SSing the  SSing the wrong way takes a real good guessing game 
move but gains an       skill of knowing when the attack is about to come in 
advantage               contact. You cannot delay your SS when we talk about 
                        going the wrong way. And to add that not all attacks 
                        can be SSw. Anything as fast as an 8-frame jab will 
                        get you everytime. When I refer to guessing game 
                        skills, it doesn't totally mean that you're facing a 
                        below-average player. Trying to defend against attacks 
                        requires guessing game skills as well in a sense that 
                        you must have an idea of what moves to defend against 
                        "will the move hit high, low, or mid?" as well as 
                        "will the next offensive be a throw?". See my point.

*********
 Walking                Walking is as simple as holding the controller to wherever.
*********               You either hold it up or down and your character walks to
P1 side   P2 side       that direction. One good use of walking that I can conjure
A   O\          |       up is to tease a losing opponent. Let them go after you. 
|    \     \    |       But that's still not good, right? 
|         \O    |       IMO, walking sucks compared to SC's 8WR system. 4WR just 
|               V       isn't good enough. And when you walk, it's like walking in 
that way    this way    the park with granny. MAN! 
                        
************************
 Auto Sidestep(orAutoSS)An auto SS requires recognition of moves and strings. 
************************It does not just end there. You must also be familiar 
 P1        P2           with what limb the succeding move will utilize as it 
    _    _              determines which way you must choose to auto SS.
   O_    _O             The foundation of the Auto SS rests upon the fact that 
                        you are able to perform thw SS motion only after the 
 P1 advances to         blocking motion of your character ends.

     _ _                 
    O_._O               Aside from this, the SS has gained a lot of advantages 
                        since T3. You will notice that SSing in TTT is a lot
 P1 connects with       easier than in T3. This is one of the reasons why I 
 hit but P2 blocks      won't put up a character SSing guide. I just told you

 P1         P2          to  AutoSS all moves. A perfect example would be the 
                        u_u/f+4,4,4,4. The reason behind this is due to the  
       ,                fact that the second and third hit of this string is 
      O_                too fast and is very complicated to autoSS even if it  
        \               was possible. Just imagine, you have to block low then 
       \O               input the SS command as fast as you can but in the end

 P1 whiff               altering of the SS in whole was beyond what I call as 
                        being FAIR. I still adhere to skill rather than luck.  
                        You'll just get lucky.
 Take note that you
 cannot auto SS         BUT IN SOME POINT, being able to autoSS is not just 
 every move dished      done by luck if you pull it off consistently. It takes 
 out by your opponent   such skill as well to do such a move. First off, you

                        did the SSing evasion property. 
                        As defined ealier, the auto SS is executing a SS while 
                        blocking and afterwards, you will auto SS after the block 
                        animation has ended. Other such attacks you SS without 
                        getting hit before SSing is a plain SS. Take a peek at this

This is quite easy when you get to notice that you can SS moves that you know what limbs
are used for it. That is the most important aspect of being able to SS naturally. Just 
familiarize yourself with this. You really don't have to memorize this. 

ALL MOVES, COMMANDS, MOTIONS, ATTACKS, STRINGS, and whatever you may call it have a 
natural way of SSing them. 

	1. It takes 6 SSs composed of 3 SSs to the to the background and 3 
         SSs to the to the screen to circle an opponent. Movement can be 
         interchanged. Coincidentally, it takes 6 SSs to circle an idiot.
	
      2. A SS extends the grabbing capability of throws. 
     
      3. It evades attacks,charging attacks as well as charging opponents - 
         only applies to short charges and not the long, invincible charge - 
         and places you behind your opponent's back. 
     
      4. SS attacks have tracking ability as long as they are delayed.
      
      5. You cannot block when you have started to SS for about 16 frames 
         after the execution of the initialization frame.
      
      6. You cannot SS the wrong way an 8 frame attack or the like. 
      
      7. You can SS sequential attacks or tenstrings by taking into 
         consideration the succeeding attack as you block and SSing to the 
         direction where the said attack can be SSed while blocking.
      
      8. SSing is better than walking.

      9. Never SS just to annoy your opponent or because 
         it might somewhat avoid an attack, esp. true when you hit walls. 

     10. Never SS before a move. It can get you into trouble. 

     11. A delayed SS will not evade a hit even if done correctly.  
   
     12. The rule SS left if the attack is done by a left limb (the same goes for 
         the right) is limited to Linear attacks, and diagonal attacks 

     13. SS at the initialization of your opponent’s move/you can also SS within 
         the starting frames of the move. Takes a lot of timing and a very 
         trained sense of sight.

     14. You must be quick with your attacks after a successful evasion of an 
         opponent’s attack via SS.

     15. Always have another SS READY for a very good CDer if you SS the CD and not 
         the attack coming out of the CD when Waving is performed.

     16. If any attack within a "string" is SSed, SS again to avoid being tracked 
         and hit or opt for the best choice, counter hit/poking.

     17. Always look at your opponent's movements, not just yours. It applies to the 
         game in general as the starting motion reveals the attack.

In this section, I will not discuss each character and how and where to SS 
their attacks since what I want to teach you is to SS via reaction. You must 
learn this unique technique of executing a SS and such follow up moves such 
as a Juggle starter and/or a throw, which is to my opinion, under-rated and 
belittled. The throw is a very powerful weapon. It only becomes such as I have 
claimed if you know when to dish out the move.
I have only cited a few moves and from which character they belong to so as to
give you an idea. 
Learning the offensive nature of an attack will teach you how to defend against
it. In the end, you can never use the same attack twice...

******************
I.  Linear attacks
******************
There are basically two types of this kind of attack

    Vertical attacks
    Horizontal Attacks

Vertical attacks are those that run down-up and up-down. Most 
juggle starters fall under this category of attack especially kick 
attacks and uppercuts.
Avoid these attacks as stated in the RULES section. Just take note
of whether the attack is a class1, class2, class3 juggle launcher.

Why?

If you eat a class1, you go up so high and land for sometime!!!

Horizontal Attacks are further divided into two types which are the 
(1) Straight horizontal attacks which travel horizontally forward. 
Examples would be the regular 1 and 2 punches, and the lightning kick
when grounded. Next, the (2) Sweeping horizontal attacks. The mentioned
attack can be SSed by the average Tekken player with medium difficulty,
I guess so. These attacks travel horizontal while doing such attack 
in a sweeping or arcing manner. Attacks of this nature are those of
Bryan and Bruce's f,f+3, Hei's standing 4. For punches, Kaz's Demon Gut 
punch fall under this category.

SS to the direction of your opponent’s attack if the nature of the 
attack is horizontally turning. If the attack sweeps right, SS to 
your right.

The simple rule for these attacks is the SS left for left limb, SS right
for the right limb.

One of the exceptions for this attack are hellsweeps. It utilizes a right 
limb but in fact it must be SSed to your left.


***********************
II. Specialized attacks
***********************
These type of attacks do not follow the rule stated above. If you don not
believe me, just keep on being hit by your opponent.

    Diagonal attacks
    Low horizontal attacks
    Two limb attacks
    Sequential horizontal attacks 
    Combinational attacks
    Crouch dashing arts
    
It seems pretty simple. But the truth is most comment on these attacks as
very hard or extremely difficult to SS.

Diagonal attacks 
Are those of Hwoarang’s f,f+3 at Right stance and, similarly, 
Xiaoyu’s f,f+3,. It is indeed very hard to SS these moves 
since the moves have annoying priority for slow moves. Against 
these,  you must SS it opposite the direction of the sweep. Moves  
like this are difficult to SS. You should opt for a grab at the 
starting motion if you ever get the chance or a counter hit.

If you try to SS these type of moves, you absolutely must not delay
your SS. You will get hit.


Low horizontal attacks
Lei's d/b+4 is a low horizontal sweep attack and SSing such a move from a 
distance is impossible. You can only do it up close. Also in this category is 
Paul's d+4. Bryan's d/f+3 is also in these category. But of all the attacks in 
this category, Bryan's sweep can be SSed easily. It just lacks speed that Paul 
and Lei's move possess.  
Don't even try SSing Paul's d+4, it'll get you into BIG TROUBLE!!!

In T3, SSing Bryan's d/f+3 will take a Jin player the necessary skills in order 
to evade this move. Heihachi's SS was simply better. 


Two limb attacks
Kuma and Panda's f+1~2 which is a two limb attack which sweep in both 
direction. To evade it, try reversing it first to get an idea of where to SS. 
Okay, just it to your ****. It's just if you forget where to SS it, reverse 
the move and the limb tells the direction of the evasion. The same goes for 
that of Nina's f+1~2. The Jacks also have two limb attacks, Christie too. 

Hmm, since I mentioned Christie, I'll talk about her a little.

Capoeiran Christie Montiero's attacks can be SSed but don't get too comfy about it. 
Despite the fact that you can evade her attacks, you must be able to interrupt 
the other moves or defend against them. Besides Kaz's u_u/f+4,4,4,4, 
Christie's attacks has a fair amount of tracking ability. If you are not the kind of 
person with lightning fast reaction, you'd have to opt for a poke or interrupt 
as she does her moves. Learn what moves the babe has that you can SS, especially those
with good tracking ability. Also learn when and where to SS again if you are not in a 
good position for retaliation.

Christies stance BTW is a natural SS killer. Watch her follow you as you SS. 
The only way for you to avoid her attacks is when you SS correctly the attack not SSing 
then hoping to evade it. Afterwhich, any fast interrupting move of Christie's strings is
a must or you will get hit.


Sequential horizontal attacks
Examples of sequential horizontal attacks are the hell sweeps and, Kaz's u/f_u+4+4+4+4 
plus Jin's b+2+1 series. With regards to SSing these attacks, extreme skill and timing 
must be present in the player who will SS the attack. Also, Law's punch and Hwoarang's 
kick arrays are in these category but are not naturally good trackers.

Please see the section about auto SS for more information.

SPECIAL TECHNIQUES
(Note: My technique is one of the reasons adding to why the u_u/f+4,4,4,4
is NOT a good move. If I see someone doing this move in a match, I even 
provoke him to do it or persuade him to do that "spin thingy").


SSing Hellsweeps, INTO THE WHIRLWIND TECHNIQUE...hehehe!!!

A hell sweep is a sequential horizontal attack which hits low and sweeps 
counter clockwise. If you are upclose and an opponent dishes this out, SS to 
your left and you will be able to evade being hit. If at a distance, the 
hell sweep tracks pretty well. So the only solution left for you to do is 
to defend low...just joking! What you should do is to anticipate the right 
timing of when to SS. A good distance would be...this is hard to explain and 
for you to swallow...I think you are experienced enough to tell whether the 
second sweep or the first sweep is ABOUT to hit you or not, the distance would 
be before the first hell sweep or second is about to hit. If you're really 
up to it, you'll go for the first sweep. 

. . .CATCHING THE WHIRLWIND

This is the same technique I use with Hei's regarded hell sweep. Some people like 
to frighten their competition or annoy them. 

But I have varied and improved it. 

The second hit can be a WGF for Hei, roundhouse for Jin, hell sweep for Devil, 
Angel, the...Jins, and Kaz. My technique is not with out assurance, it is a 
double edged sword. If you did avoid being hit when you SSed, you can over power 
him with the follow up in my technique...that is catching the WHIRLWIND.
In Tekken, the only way you can catch someone is to do a throw. So the really 
safest way is to SS and grab your opponent! Even if Hei and Jin does a 
different move, IT DOESN'T MATTER. The throw will out prioritize their move. 
So if you have that incredible concentration and composure, your skill will 
be heightened to such level of play that I assure you ...you will not loose 
as long as you know your Tekken basics. 
(The above move is patented to me, and no one in the whole Tekken community,
game guides has ever come up with a technique or strategy to evade such 
moves.)

Jin's b+2,1 can be SSed but you must act quickly if the opponent does delay
the move. It will track and hit. SS the first hit to your right. Just that.
Also, if the opponent doesn't delay, poke. 

But let me tell you that if you do not have the knack for when this move
is coming at you, no matter what you do you will get hit, SS..that's what 
I meant. And if you are experienced enough and is up to the challenge, you 
can SS this move in both directions if you see Jin move back, at times followed
by neutrality, than a sudden forward with his right elbow being shown behind
his back then a horizontal attack - right hook. If you get hit while guarding, 
SSing the next move to the right will be almost impossible...impossible if you
Auto SS the wrong way. 
You can only SS the second hit if you were not hit by the first. But if the
first hits you, tap f immediately not repeatedly because you will break your
own guard and that is quite stupid. Another alternative would be
By SSing the first hit successfully, you must interrupt the second hit at all 
cost. If you end up close while the second hit is about to make contact...it
will hit the spot. Some may use the laser canon/scrapper in a very wrong
way against SSers. Do not attempt to use this move to scare someone at a 
very wrong distance because it is fairly easy to evade the move given such
opportunity. 

Some attacks, even at close range, just cannot be SSed.


Combinational attacks
Examples of this kind of attack are Paul's d+1,4,2 and ten strings. You don't
get the chance to SS all the moves in this type of attack but SSing the first
array of the move can be a relief. Paul's d,d/b,b+3,2,2 can back track as long
as it is delayed and all that. So be careful when you do evade the first and
second hit of this attack since if you don't guard or CH as you evaded the 
move, the back tracking last attack will hit you. That is if the opponent did 
delay the move. Otherwise, your opponent will end up showing his stuff while 
you punish him afterwards.


Crouch Dashing arts
I have menioned that the rule SS left if left limb blah, blah, blah is not all
that true. Do you SS a hell sweep done by a right limb to your right? I think
not!
Anyways, I will not discuss about the standard CD attacks but those attacks
which revolve around the specialized use of the crouch dash, highly regarded
but are unconventional moves in reality. 


START OF SPECIAL MENTION

Don't try too many ss up close unless you have a decent frame advantage
.. cause wgf will pick you up out of a close ss all the time (I learned 
that the hard way) .. One little tip is IF YOU SEE A CD COMING TOWARDS YOU,
DON'T SIDESTEP. at that point it's too late and hellsweep or wgf will track
you. do the ss in anticipation for good results.

END OF SPECIAL MENTION


SSing a CD

You can SS a CD. All you need to do is if you see the opponent after a 
forward dash go into crouch position, dash forward and SS to your left. 
What comes next are S.O.P. which I think you know what to do by now...
punish them!!!

What's this special mention all about? 

The one thing he did a good job on was telling you not to SS sequentially.
Other than that, he doesn't know the mechanics behind the SS. It takes a keen
eye to see an EWGF coming. It doesn't take as much skill to see whether a WGF,
or hellsweep coming at you. That's just my opinion as that's the way I see it.

A good example of a CD move coming at you would be the TGF. You see the 
crouching motion as it draws near your character. SS left, throw or CH or 
Juggle. End of discussion.


Wave dash
     WGDRUC (Wave Uppercut) f,N,d,d/f,b,...WS+2
     WGDRDUC (Wave Pistons) f,N,d,d/f,b,...WS+1,2 
     WEWGF (Wave Electric Wind godfist)

The Wave uppercut and Pistons are two risky moves against a defensive expert.
But if they don't know it yet, it's one hell of a move and juggle starter. 
The same goes for the WEWGF. The only thing that I see as a stand out move from 
the rest of these branched wave dash forms is the WEWGF. It covers more
distance than the Wave Uppercut and Wave Pistons and it comes out faster. 
Do not let your opponent gain distance to dish these moves out. Move CLOSE as
possible to them (which I think will not be your option 4. You will not be able 
to SS this move after being guard stunned.
You can SS the WGDRUC to your left, the WGDRDUC to your right but be careful 
since the Twin Pistons of Kaz is flawless as the word goes around, which is 
TRUE. 
The WEWGF can be SSed to the left as long as you don't SS the first CD. 
To evade the hit by an EWGF, get close to your opponent and SS the seccond CD, 
not the first CD. But if you don't get me, just block it and be prepared if the
opponent opts for a throw or hellsweep. Deal with the taunts...
What makes WEWGF better than the other two is due to the fact that you can opt
for a fake dash if you're in a tight spot. And if you notice that your opponent
knows where to SS this move, you can opt to slow down from the transition of the
first CD to forward wihich cancels the move and do the second CD at EWGd speeds.


Dash Electric Windgodfist
This move is good to pull out when an opponent whiffs at a distance. This 
variation of the CD helps the EWGF to gain ground than a normal EWGF. SSing 
this move is to SS left but pay attention to when the opponent's character 
(Kaz or Hei) comes out of the CD to deliver the EWGF. This is also SSed the same
manner as a WEWGF. Get close when the second CD comes. 
The DEWGF cannot be SS if you whiffed or you are just coming out of a guard stun
as it is almost guaranteed to hit - f,f,F+3 then DEWGF. 


Wave Electric Windgodfist
This move, if the opponent is SS happy and is a bit scared of your offensive
is pretty much good to dish out if at a distance. It covers more ground than
a DEWGF. If you do not know the mechanics of this move, you'll have a hard 
time evading it.
But pay attention to when the opponent decides to attack as he will most likely 
time his move of when to dish it out even if you SS the right way. You will get
hit if you SS out of phase or timing with when the opponent executes the move.

Fake Wave
The fake wave is to lure the opponent into whiffing. If the opponent falls for
this move, what comes next is INEVITABLE if done correctly, EWGF. This is my
move of choice especially against a good Bryan player who doesn't do short
strings. Bryan's b+1~2 is an outstanding move! But I'm better because I can 
always pull the plug and say I'm the champ!!! hehehe!!!


Snake dash
The snake dash is as risky as doing a mist step. I refer to the move as Jin 
and Hei's mist step version of Kaz's mist step. The move sucks if you don't 
know how to SS correctly. You can SS to any direction but do you really have 
an idea yourself what move an opponent will do if the former stands still and 
watches your every SS while at neutral guard?
But I don't want you to get thew notion that the mist step is a bad move, it 
isn't! This move comes in handy as a guessing game tool. 

******************** 
 Just my opinion...                       
******************** 

The Wave Uppercut and Pistons are for masters use. Wave dashing and move coming
out of it won't work very well against defensive experts. The fake wave, it 
takes a very good perceptual speed to see what move comes out but you are 
risking retaliation if you don't know your spacing. The snake dash is as good 
as wave dashing and mist step all together minus the mist step moves that you 
have at your disposal after the SS, that's if you get to use it too much.

That's just my opinion. You have yours. Look at the First Ammendment because
I have my rights. And one of them is...you already know!

The key in SSing these moves is perceptual speed that you possess. My 
Perceptual Speed Theory (ha!) will only work if you have a good knack to see 
any of the above moves coming coupled with your ability to react as fast or 
even faster than your opponent. My theory also incorporates the thinking 
"...my move is a result of your move..." which is pretty easy to understand.
Are you buying this? 

Let me illustrate.

A dashed EWGF can be SSed. But what you need to do is to put in mind if the
opponent will push through with his attack. If he is planning up on other 
things, I suggest that you prepare an escape for a throw, and be on Active
guard. Otherwise, you'll see the opponent coming at you full speed. That is
his mistake since he is so busy pulling off an EWGF after tapping forward
that you just evaded him. 
To evade the DEWGF is to SS once the character leaves the CD into the attack.
Also, you can just dish out a throw as he draws near because it'll 
out-prioritize the opponents offensive. Once the opponent is as near as twice
an AL or lesser, you can do a throw while noticing that your character also 
moves forward. It only shows that you have out prioritized his move. 

A WEWGF takes composure to SS. If we break down and disect further into the
WEWGF, we will notice that it is a crouch dash immediately followed by a DEWGF.

It is always good to break down a good offensive's blue print rather than 
attacking it head on because at such compound level, analysis of any weak 
points for the move is very hard. But the thing is if you're trying to do the
breaking down in a match for the first time, you'll end up eating the first 
barrage of offense your opponent does.

In the strictest sense, SSing is mainly used for defensive purposes. But 
then there's always an exception.
I reiterate, I assume the responsibility that you are not a newbie, scrub, 
or still a scrub, and/or otherwise. All the discussions herein are highly 
suited for average and high level players as only such kind of people have 
a high probability or chance of pulling off any of the things that will be 
stated and discussed from now on. If by any chance you belong to those 
which I have mentioned, do not despair as everyone goes through that stage
or have gone through it but not when they played Tekken. 
Yeah, right. I was just fooling around. 


THROW GAME, WALL GAME, JUGGLE

Most Tekken players don't notice why others consistently SS. With reference 
to the  second property I wrote, that says it all. Some may disagree that if 
you SS and grab you must be close or closeR. NO! It's a misconception. Try 
SSing and if you are about one to three-halves arms-length away 
(characterwise), try to execute a throw. It'll grab your opponent to your 
and his surprise. Also, a back and side throw is as TRICKY to escape as a 
multi-throw because any throw can be executed for the same motion, side 
throw if grabbed by the sides...right side motion and left side motion have 
similar commands. Back throw if grabbed behind. And to add that back and 
side throws are much flashy. When your throw is being escaped, your opponent 
must be able to initiate the escape command as fast as he can, but it seems 
impossible especially if you evaded an attack. The recovery time of your 
opponent from such a move works to your advantage.

Back throws cannot be escaped! But you can always duck. That is if your 
opponent doesn't juggle you. And don't under-estimate a BIG character.

If you end behind your opponent after SSing an attack, you have a couple of 
choices. One of which is to juggle, quick juggles I mean. If you can inflict 
juggles that can take more than 40 points of damage off your opponents life 
bar, the better. If you can't, opt for a grab for an instant 60 points 
damage. That is if your opponent does not face you before you grab. Well,
if you're trying to work on your juggle, execute one to gain better 
juggling ability. But you'll pay the price if you make a mistake.


Juggles
I'm quite speechless when it comes to juggles and all that. Almost everything
about the aspect of juggling has been covered by so many faqs/guides here
in gamefaqs. 

Just for the sake of it, here I go...

To be able to do and execute juggles everytime defines the outcome 
of the match. The more devastating the juggles you know, the more the fight 
is going to be easy for you, that is if you get it to connect at all.

In high level matches, seldom do these kinds of attacks arise since
both competitors know of the damage potential if the other inflicts 
a juggle. Characters like the Mishimas and the Kazamas are natural jugglers
and deal powerful juggles. If you get juggled by a Jin player once, that 
maybe all that he needs. Each of the opponents set up attacks then link it 
with juggle follow up moves that can mean the end of the round. If you are
able to escape it, good for you. Atleast pray that your opponent miscalculates
or does a mistake.

The only thing you can do is to block or avoid it as much as possible. In my
case, avoiding a juggle starter would be the best option.

Why?

If you successfully SS and avoid a juggle starter move, you've set yourself
up for free hits at you opponent. And that means it your time to do some 
juggling yourself. And do it as fast as possible if the attack you've manage 
to avoid has quick recovery time. But be aware of the moves you dish out
for not all moves you do would create an opportunity for you to do damaging 
juggles. If you can only do juggles after such predicament in which the
damage is meager, than I suggest learn the more damaging juggle move.

Practice makes perfect. But the way you do it is the key to whether you win 
or not. You must possess excellence in execution for if not and even if 
you do know how to juggle, it would just have been a waste of time since you
can't use it to work for you. 

************************************************************ *****     **  **  **   
 Wall Game                                                    **  **  **   ***
************************************************************ **ekken **    * 4

Walls have almost similar properties as that of the ground. You can get-up from it
when you slammed into one, you can use it to your leverage to extend juggle damage.
The technique in walls to be able to fully utilize it is not just knowing when to do
your launcher, what juggle to do, or whatever follow-ups but knowing how to utilize 
POSITION CHANGING. 

Combining position change, just right juggles, okizeme tactics, and SSing knowledge
will be as devastating as familiarity of the aforementioned is what's required of you
in order to adapt to T4's system. 

***************
 Wall Training
***************

In order to naturally juggle opponents out of wall slammy opportunities, you'd have to
choose a stage wherein you'd be able to get frequent juggle opportunities with walls
as well as familiarization of what to do when you're on the receiving end of the end. 

*^O^*

       01. Try to choose smaller stages 
       02. Formulate juggles coming off launchers to deal decent or max damage
       03. If you're afraid of getting pinned to the wall, some stages can help
           you hide from opponents.

In some stages, you can opt to stay on the other side of a wall. Even if your opponent 
tries to charge at you, they'll find it slightly hard to do as the wall is in their way.
For example, the Beach stage is perfect for this situation - that towering wall made
of wood...-_- You can gain advantage by going near the corner end ot that wall and wait 
for your opponent then poke. 

*************
 Tight Spots
*************

If you seem to be in a tight spot and all you can do is block, just remember that you
can execute either a THROW (discussed in the next section) or a POSITION CHANGE command
to gain advantage over relatively slower moves. Get acquainted with Frame execution of
moves, special arts, and special commands. A Throw or, in this case, a position change 
command has what we call a Frame Hit. The frame hit is the time for a particular move
to hit or for it to do it's stuff after pressing the command button for it after the 
motioning.

The odds look very much the same but remember that as long as you can beat them to the
punch, a position change will out prioritize your opponent's offensive. For a detailed
info on prioritization, see the next section (Throwing before a move).

 Tech Rolls
************

You guessed that one right. You can tech roll off a wall slammy. But remember, there are 
other forms of tech rolling as well as situations calling for it. Most of the time, you
feel like shit when you tech roll and get hit, and you then hit a wall so you feel like 
bananas. I know how that feels. Feels like bananas, what esle? 

^^

Anyways, some people tech roll immediately after hitting a wall. If you get to block your
opponent's move after that, don't just consider blocking all day and staying in the same 
spot until you finally notice that it's time. If, just if, the AUTO-SS is not taken out
of T4, get away from there then hit back at your opponent. 

Another good way of doing things right is deciding on whether small okizeme damage
gets to you more than a major okizeme juggle. Tech roll to your sides. Get to know your
opponent's fave okizeme then roll off from that attack to the correct direction. It's
almost like SSing an attack. You can either roll then do b,b or f,f commands if you wish.
it's your choice.

Does anyone do throws in Tekken anymore? I know I do.

In local arcade matches, seldom would you see someone do a throw, unless their
King, Nina, or Craig. But you see, throwing is still in and can be of
great advantage to you. You can also gain psychological advantages if you know 
how to do it.

Hmm, it comes to my attention that when you do a throw, your opponent just 
escapes it with relative ease. Here's where I come in to frustrate your enemies.


******************************************************************************
I. Execute throws on whiffed moves
******************************************************************************

This will be your biggest advantage. The recovery time of your opponent works
against your opponent and not you. It'll always get your opponent and frustrate
him as it now becomes trickier to escape. As a general rule, the longer the 
recovery time, the harder it is to escape the throw and the better the chance
for you to do some damage with the throw. Also consider a back dash a whiffed 
move.


******************************************************************************
II. Execute throws with two input escapes
******************************************************************************


It's pretty hard to escape throws with two input escapes. But if your opponent 
can escape it everytime, it'll be hard for him to know if you did such kind of 
throw we are speaking after you do a sidestep. 

Very nasty, isn't it? 

Some Tekken players can see what kind of throw you are pulling off. Kind? I mean
the kind of escape for the throw you just did. Hmm, you seem amazed. But it
isn't all that impossible. 

To basically know what throw escape to dish out when an opponent does a throw is 
to have some idea of what arm he used to grab you with. I will list them down,
and it's regardless of what throw your opponent does as long as you know what 
arm he used

          
          1. Throw done with the left arm extended than the right arm can
             be escaped with the inputting of 1 (square)
          2. Throw done with the right arm extended than the left arm can
             be escaped with the inputting of 2 (triangle)
          3. Throw done with both arms extended can be escaped with both
             punch buttons
          4. Throw done while on the left side can be escaped by 1
          5. Throw done while on the right side can be escaped by 2

You must remember one thing when doing such escape. You must do it before your
opponent's character twist's, lift's or lay's hand on your character. Once any
of the following have been executed, is twisting, lifting, grasping already, on 
your character, escape is inevitable even if you press the right escape button.
Being late is has never done any good, even in real life.

If you want to learn how to escape multithrows,  site dedicated to King is a 
good place to visit.


******************************************************************************
III. Execute side throws
******************************************************************************


Side throws are cool! Refer to Lee's side throws for some first hand experience
on side throws; thanks a million "maureen" - maureen of TTT.com forum. She is
quite good with Lee and Law.

Anyways, side throws are for guessing games. Aside from doing an attack or
standard SS attack, you can opt for a side throw. And it deals quite good 
damage for that matter.

The advantages of side throwing are obvious. First off, it's conceiled...whether
what throw you do since you hide behind your opponent or your back is exposed
to the screen. Second, if you evaded a move you can grab your opponent's 
character even at two armslength distance, characterwise. 

Just do it to know more. Some of the facts I told you are based on the glicthes 
in the game.


******************************************************************************
IV. Back throws
******************************************************************************


This is the ultimate throw you can ever execute but you won't usually end up 
behind your opponent. The rewards in pulling this move off out weighs the risks
that you are faced with. 

Back throws, for a fact, cannot be escaped. Period. Nothing follows. Be a scrub
all your life.

Second, back throws are very devastating. It even out-weighs  damages some 
juggles and unblockables inflict. Refer to Kaz's back throw for coolness and 
Toshin, Ogre's back throw for some kick ass damage. Actually, you can go to 
the washroom and do your stuff than come back to see the Ogre has just depleted 
a whopping 70 points of damage off your opponent.

Just remember one thing about trying to back throw, be quick about it. I asked
a friend, Blackwind, about the decency of back throwing against Jun and her
White heron after evading the third hit (Yes, you can evade the third hit).
It turns out that Jun's WH is far different than Jin's WH since it has real
good tracking ability than the latter.

Blackwind, thanks a lot for this info!!!


******************************************************************************
V. Throwing before a move
******************************************************************************


This requires EXTREME skill, COMPOSURE to it's fullest, and TIMING. If you 
think you don't have this qualities in you, don't try it. 

If you see a move coming and you have time to block it, I suggest you throw out
a throw. You can throw, Hei, Kaz, Jin as they do a WGF or that of Paul's DF. It 
is even useful against those who use unblockables (!), with some exceptions.

Hwoarang's f,f+3 can also be caught if you know the timing and if you're up
to it.

If you think you can do more damage from a juggle, do it then as long as you
know what to do because yoiu need to do it fast!

I reiterate, I assume the responsibility that you are not a newbie, scrub, 
or still a scrub, and/or otherwise. All the discussions herein are highly 
suited for average and high level players as only such kind of people have 
a high probability or chance of pulling off any of the things that will be 
stated and discussed from now on. If by any chance you belong to those 
which I have mentioned, do not despair as everyone goes through that stage
or have gone through it but not when they played Tekken. 
Also, take note of the rules I imposed on you before doing any SSing. Remember
them by heart!


******************************************************************************
VI. Miscellaneous Info on Throwing
******************************************************************************

I just want everyone to know that there are other things about throwing vaguely
known, understood. 

An opponent doing a two-fisted dive can be thrown if and only if you are close
and as long as your opponents feet do not leave the ground.

You can also throw someone doing flip kicks. But I haven't done it yet, only 
my cousin. He consistently does that if you consistently do flip kicks. So, 
sorry if I can't inform you about how to do it. I won't write down what I don't
know. 

Hmm, my friend told me that when Law does his flips kicks, you can do a throw 
as long as Law's foot is in contact with the ground, perpendicular in nature is
the position. Thanks, Blackwind!!!

I don't quite get it sometimes, but as long as I win, who cares about it!!!


******************************************************************************
Effective Range of Throwing
******************************************************************************

Almost everyone will say that to execute a throw with a a probability of one
out of one you should be done close to the opponent or half an AL. But that is
not true at all!

Give me ten reasons why you doubt me when you e mail but I'll answer your 
queries right now here in this section. I will be devoting this section to the 
analysis of the throw range ER.

Effective Range has been defined in the definition section of this faq to be
twice an AL to its maximum range. I don't think specifying the minimum range 
would do any good. But why 2AL?

The 2AL can only be confirmed on whiffs and on article five (V. Throwing before 
a move) of the Throw game section. It is only then can you execute a throw 
at its maximum distance. But keep in mind that you may find it as something 
really WEIRD. 

An example of this is when an opponent, say uses Jin, does a WGF at a distance 
from you just enough to count as twice an AL, quickly execute a throw and voila,
you got yourself about 30 points of neat damage  while leaving your opponent 
wondering what went WRONG, very wrong!!!

It's some kind of mathematical glitch which the system buffers as a valid throw.

************************************************************ **ekken **    * 4

SSing is a great help for okizeme and further okizeme opportunities or for other
juggle freebies. If ever you knock an opponent far from you either after an okizeme
move or a one hit wonder, try charging or dashing towards your opponent then SS around
then fallen opponent who, at that time, is trying to get up. 

You may opt to change your tactic after showing this startegy to your opponent by 
backing off, yeah, nastily turtling around and then giving them the BANG!!!

Why an anti-SS guide? 

The purpose of my tutorial is to impart knowledge to all about what I know about
Sidestepping and as well as knowing that SSing can evade almost all the moves
an opponent can dish out, I am also aware that not every move can be evaded.

The infamous WEWGF and DEWGF are said to be very good anti-SS moves. But is it
all that? And does it really track a SS 100%? I think you'd also be asking
that yourselves.

Nonetheless, Tekken is still a game. A game which is governed by the protocols
intrinsic to the game's program. If you are knowledgeable about all the aspects
of this rules, you are vey lucky for you are the better fighter. That's of 
course if and only if you know it and know how to use such knowledge.


*****************  
SS Misconceptions                                           
***************** 

No move is invincible once you get to know more about it. This is what I've 
learned. This is what I keep in mind whether I go into offense or be on the 
defensive end when I fight. Keep this in mind, make it one of your philosophies 
while fighting. 

To go on, there are many misconceptions about the SS. Let me then list some of 
them down for you.

     
     SS-cancelling
     sequential SSing
     close proximity
     dashing
     forward and back tap; 


SS-cancelling
This generally refers to the well known "if your opponent SSs, SS to cancel 
their SS" thingy. This is generally good if you're up against manageable 
opponents. It's very hard pull this off against better opponents since they 
have the option to CH you as you are in the starting frames of the SS motion or 
perform a throw depending on the proximity. This also leads to a 
sequential-SSing contest, if close, where each player SSs to get the advantage 
and nail the other. When this is most likely to happen, it is much better to 
crouch and to low pokes than quickly respond to any mid offensive done by your 
opponent. 
As you perform a SS out of your opponent's SS, you are vulnerable to be thrown
if and when you are up close. The throw is done as you SS and not after the 
16th frame vulnerability since you can crouch after the said frames. 
Quite decent but not that good...


sequential SSing
This is a very bad move. This move sucks since DEWGF and WEWGF will hit you. 
Especially if your opponent can do EWGF very fast, the CD motion, at close 
proximity you're a GONER!!! Don't try doing this against someone doing a Devil 
possession with Jin. I do believe Devil Jin's WGF is by then extremely fast. 
One more reason why this move is bad is because if your opponent is 
knowledgeable with SSing, a move that tracks very well to the direction 
where you are SSing is your opponent's choice.
An example of such situation would be if you sequentially SS to your right...a 
Wind Godfist really means Wind Godfist. It'll hit you unless your timing and 
distance are just right for a SSw.
But take note that DEWGF and WEWGF can only hit you if the actual EWGF move is 
preceeded by a slow forward to track a SSing opponent. A very fast WEWGF and 
DEWGF will whiff.

That's if you are facing a very good opponent. Most of the time, you're just
facing a decent levelled player who doesn't even wave dash. 

To be fair, sequential SSing is hard if you don't have a sense of what's really
going on. Remember, your opponent is also taking a chance as they won't be able 
do move that they usually do when they get out of axis. The best way to get 
to these guys, sort of a first option, is by way of poking. Strike with the 
limb closest to them.

close proximity
At this range, you can make a fool of anyone if you know when and where to SS, 
start and stop, hit and do a throw. But usually you won't end up this close and 
that you haven't experienced being this close. In this range, you can 
sequentially SS and do a SSw as long as you are not faced with the Changs and 
with anyone with an 8 frame jab.

At this range, the better pitbull player has an advantage. No body does do
serious SSing game. And if you do see someone, their just one in a million.

dashing
If you play Tekken using a stick rather than a d-pad you have an advantage 
since dashing with a d-pad is hard if you want to do a dash at high level of 
play and perform variations since blisters are inevitable. Even a seasoned d-
pad Tekken player will say so. Crouch dash, wave dash, roll dash.
Some would refer to dashing as a prelude to demolishing a SSing opponent. If 
the SSing opponent is stupid enough to SS out of the blue without any attack to 
evade, than these things are true. Otherwise, read the definition of what a SS
is really used for and rethink about this.


************************************************************ ***** ***** ***** 
Anti-SS strats                                                **    **    **  
************************************************************ **    **    ** 

There is quite a big difference between an anti-SS move/strat/technique to
a SS-tracking move. If you get hit by a SS-tracking move, you are just plain 
stupid. Read what SS means in the definiton section before you go on.

Wave dashing, leading to WEWGF, DEWGF, is a move that if your opponent SSs at
a very early stage, will track them down since the EWGF has incredible speed
to boot!

Now, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION?


Anti-SS strat 1
Paul's Death Fist is a prime canditate for SSing. It's very slow compared to
Hei's DF but the rewards are very high IF you get them to connect. Against a 
decent player, you may not be able to sink this move in. The only solution is 
to use the property of the dash motion to your advantage.

This is how it goes

          Paul's DF motion does a crouch and is executed by d,d/f,f. If you
          hit 2, you get a DF. But the thing is your opponent can easily evade
          this move to the right. What move will you have to do in order to
          not whiff?
          Change the attack but be able to use the crouching motion of the DF.
          This is done by executing a QCF then immediately followed by d+4.
          Do you remember that d+4 with Paul is virtually impossible to SS?
          Right! And the QCF motion helps you close in the gap to prevent 
          stagger effects. What you've got is a potent tool against a correctly
          done SS. But that's from T3. They took that out when TTT came. I don't 
          know for T4. 

But this move is for Tekken 3 only. For those of you who have noticed, this
move is quite one of Paul's dreaded moves in T3. They (Namco) toned it down.
It was so good in T3 that you have a guessing game for Paul's RD unlike 
for TTT.

Anti-SS strat 2
Poke when the opponent is in the first few frames and you will be so happy 
because it'll hit them. Intiendez? This is specially effective against 
someone doing a sequential SS. Also, there is a trick here. You have to poke
in between the starting and up to the 11th frame of the SS motion. This is
due to the fact that your opponent cannot block your pokes at this stage.
Another thing is that if your opponent is a persistent SSing dude. The best 
thing to do is give them the knock out move. 

Anti-SS strat 3
Slow input of forward or CD cancel for DEWGF, WEWGF will track a SSing 
opponent. This is the trick wherein it makes these two motions very effective 
as anti-SS strategies. If you always tend to do the CD cancel very fast, you 
will whiff because of such fast motion input cannot follow a SS move. That's
if the SS is done to the left. Just be careful if your opponent SS left.

Mechanics

          For DEWGF and before second CD for WEWGF, press forward when your
          opponent SSs. That means waiting for your opponent to SS. It will
          look as if you've executed a slow DEWGF and WEWGF but delaying the 
          forward will make the EWGF track the SS and hit your opponent. You 
          also have the option to cancel the dash into a fake dash if you ever 
          get into a tight spot and even doing an EWGF will only make you 
          whiff.

Anti-SS strat 4
Back dash, dash forward, SS as well, then use moves that track both to the 
left and right then use them interchangeably. This also plays as a guessing 
game for your opponent. 

Lastly, you only meet a good SSing opponent once in a blue moon. Most players
SS one way. That's either only to the left or to the right. So take note of
these little things. 


What I presented to you the reader are basics behind SSing to be incorporated 
to your game. When I started to do serious WD techniques, my SSing skills 
became below-average that at times when I needed to SS, I always get hit. 
No technique is superior. It only becomes such when you use it correctly. 
Use everything you know and start to get to know your opponent's limitations
and skills. Once you get there, you will go to another level. You don't just
learn to fight, you learn to get to know your opponent first.

 Something I want to test out                                 **  **  **   ***
************************************************************ **ekken **    * 4

In T3 and TTT, Jin had a special attribute to his Laser Series move - the additional
Side step motion. So what? 

The additional SS motion in the execution of the Laser series translates to instant 
Laser series execution since opponents usually expect a delay, a long one in some aspect,
when you try an out of SS move. Also, you can, at some point, get CH advantage when 
doing this move. I never saw this published by Castel when I tried getting his attention
about the move. But he acknowledged it's existence - Julia has similar thingy like this,
which you all know. 

**********
 The move
**********

How should we call this move? Stepping Laser Series? Whatever!!!

command              Comment

b,SS,f+2,1,2         You can either SS to your right or to your left
                     depending on the present outcome of a match. CH advantage
b,SS,f+2>1>2         can be achieved since you can evade attacks as you execute 
                     this move, seemingly out of the blue
b,SS,f+2,1,d+2
                     
b,SS,f+2>1>d+2

b,SS,f+2,1,d+2*

What happened when I tested this move out many times before?
I've come to a conclusion that not many players know about this move. It just shows. 
You'd hear some say how chessy jin is but the truth is, is that the transition from
b then SS then forward is just so seemingly sudden that it gets your oppoennt off guard
and gaining you free hits.

remember. BTW, SUPERCOP and/or PERFECTKAZUYA, you're in here too! And where the 
hell are you now? I just can't help wondering. Oh yeah, hello to 
carbonmonoxide ^.^ <--Eoin. Yeah, I don't want to forget this guy. Hi to 
Talon_Karrde. Also, J and M Chang, Hitman4hire, and all of you I forgot.

Jamie, what would I do without you? Thanks a lot!!!!

Viki, Cindy, Jeny, Maria, Mery, and Jason, hello to you people!!!

There are other people whom I wish to acknowledge but...oh well, whatever!!!
Oh yeah, special thanks to Castel and tragic for the info I got from TZ. Thanks
to Dohee (who's coming out of the army next year) for his EWGF and WGD character
guide/tutorial. 

There is but one last dude I forgot to mention. He has opened my eyes to 
Tekken showing me that it is, was, and will be the best ever fighting game.
Thanks Leo! 

I would also like to thank other people I matched up against. Especially that 
guy whom I fought against with one hand. It was a tight match though despite 
the fact that I lost! wahahaha!!!! Plus the guy who always defeated me. I 
defeated the guy who defeated you, and in effect, makes me beat you in a way.

SERVES YOU RIGHT!!!
