Disclaimer: I, the author, do not claim to have conceptualized all the
strategies listed in
this guide. Some are original, while some were learned from friends, some
were read from other guides, even some were copied from watching other
people play (why that bastard...) I will, though, do my best to give credit
to those people. If any of you out there have thought of the same
strategies or something similar, then my thanks to you too.

About Me:   I'm 18, from the Philippines.  I've been playing Tekken since Tekken 
		3, but stopped playing before TTT came out, and have come out of 	
		hibernation last year with the coming of Tekken 4. I regularly use 
		Steve, Marduk, and Paul. (Combot for a little fun)

*** If you have seen the older versions of this document, you're probably 
wondering why everything has suddenly disappeared. Let me explain. I've decided 
to concentrate on Steve strategies only. No more move analysis, damage values, 
comments, etc. You have the movelists and the frame database for that. I've 
you're a beginner with Steve, then I suggest you read first the other Steve FAQs 
on the net. I suggest you take a look at Ai-Uchi's Steve Fox FAQ on 
TekkenZaibatsu. It's a great start.
	Then check this out afterwards. ***

	-doesn't have any standing kicks
	-no WS mix-ups
	-weak okizeme game

II. Moves

III.	General Strategy

	This section deals with three (3) main aspects of Steve's game: Offense, 
Defense, and Mix-ups. Other aspects like Throwing, Okizeme, and Arena specifics  
aren't big parts of Steve's game, and therefore will not be covered in detail.


A.	Offense


1.)	Jabbing and Poking

		This is where your offense starts, and what will probably decide the 
match in the crunch. Though Steve's jab-based offense lacks on some parts, it is 
still superior to most characters.

Table 1.0	Character jabs and jab strings to consider:

Character		Frames		String		Notes


Heihachi		10			1,1,2			KD's, guaranteed
Jin			10			2,1			0 on block, hits h,m
Julia			8			1,1,1			CH launcher
Kazuya		10			1,1,2			KD's, guaranteed
King			9			2,1			Grab set-up on hit
Kuma/Panda		10			f+1,1,1		CH launcher
Law			8			1,2,3			h,h,m, guard break
Lee/Violet		8			1,2,4:4		Guaranteed, big damage
Marduk		10			1,d+2			h,m, guard break
Nina			8			1,2,1,2		Uninterruptible
Paul			8			1,2			Fastest reset time

	Lee and the Mishimas use jab strings as an instant retaliation. Julia and 
the bears use it as a CH interrupt. Law, Nina, Jin, and Paul use it pressure 
opponents. King and Marduk use it for offensive mix-ups. Steve uses his jabs for 
all of these. Meaning, Steve's offense revolves around nothing but his jabs. 	
	Unfortunately, Steve's jabs don't have the guaranteed damage like those of 
Julia, Heihachi, Kazuya, and Lee. He doesn't end with positive frame advantage 
like Paul, Nina, Jin, and Law. He can't mix up afterwards like King and Marduk.
	What makes Steve's jabs so dangerous, though, is not what he can do 
afterwards, but what his opponent will do afterwards. Steve's game revolves 
around poking and reaction. Similar to Paul pulling out a b,f+1 or Law doing a 
d+2,3 when you poke back after a jab string, Steve thrives more on the 
opponent's reactions, drawing them out using his fast jabs.
	See the next section for an application for this theorem.


1.1 	1,2 and the British Edge

The British Edge (1,2,1) is the center of Steve's offense. It's 8-frame fast, 
guaranteed 30+ damage on CH, uninterruptible, quick transition to Flicker (~b) 
and Sway stances (f_b_N+3_4), and has a built-in forward motion. The bad news is 
it hits h,h,h which makes Steve a prime candidate for WS shit, and it leaves you 
at -2 on block, which is actually quite good, but other 8-framers won't have a 
problem jabbing out of it.
As mentioned above, the British Edge is best used to draw out responses from 
your opponents, where Steve is at his best.


Table 1.1	After the British Edge

Opponent's Reaction			Steve's Response

Any high attack				Sway; Albatross Spin; Duck
Counter-jab					Punch-Parry; Sway; Sidestep
Opponent ducks				d/f+1 strings; ~b to FLI 1,f+1; Sonic Fang
Duck-jab or Low attack			Low Parry to Sonic Fang 
Opponent turtles				d+2,1; d/f+1 strings; ~b to FLI 1,f+1; 1+3
Any attack above 10 frames		ss_b,b to British Edge
Reversal					Chicken if possible
Parry						Hold B to auto-sway (Bryan only); Pray
Sidestep w/o attack			re-align
Sidestep w/attack				Duck	(most SS attacks hit high or low)
Evasive attack				Block or Sidestep
									
	These are what you should do based on what you expect your opponent to do. 
Of course this takes a lot of anticipation and guessing on Steve's part, but the 
payoff is worth it. 



2.)	Side-turns and Off-axis stuns.

	Off-axis positions are a good thing for Steve because it allows him to 
keep the offensive momentum, and pressures the opponent for a response. Imagine 
getting sideturned by Hwoarang's Backlash or d/b+4,4. If you duck or try to 
attack off-axis, you'd most likely get launched by a b+3 or smacked by f,f+3.	
If you block standing, you'll eat another d/b+4,4. Either way, you're screwed.
	Steve's off axis mix-ups work something to that effect. You can get a 
standing opponent with a poking d+2,1 or d/b+2, or you can keep up the pressure 
by doing 1,2,1 , d/f+1 strings FLI 1,f+1, or f+3_4, f+2 which offers another 
sideturn if blocked. A ducking opponent will get nailed by a Sonic Fang, while 
anyone foolish enough to attack will get CH'd by a 3+4~2 or 3,1. 

2.1 The d/f+1,2,1

D/f+1,2,1 hits high, and can be interrupted between the first and last hit. The 
good thing is it offers +1 on block, Crumple Fall Stun on CH, and yes, Side-turn 
on block.
	The d/f+1,2,1 is also a quick transition to flicker stance (d/f+1,2,1~b). 

2.2 The f+3_4, f+2

F+3_4, f+2 hits high, KD's on hit, Crumple Fall Stun on Ch, and yes, Side-turns 
on block. It hits high, but the danger of getting nailed with a 2 or 1 from 
ducking stance makes opponents reluctant to duck.

			3+4~2
			DCK mix-ups
			3,1

d/f+1,2,1 		~b FLI + follow-ups
			all DCK f+2 follow-ups		





3.)	Going Low

	Steve isn't a low hitter. Everyone knows that. His d/b+2 is damn slow and 
is easily punished (17 frames, -15 on block). His d+2,1 is just as slow, but is 
safer, does more damage, but is still not much of a threat than Law, Paul, and  
Lei's low hits. Still, poking low gives your opponent something to worry about 
in the crunch, and can give you those little chips of damage that are just 
enough to win the game.

3.1	d+2,1

	d+2,1 hits high,mid, does about 25 damage (I think). Is guaranteed at 
close range, and though slow, is still very unexpected. This move is very 
important in your poking game, just as your 1,2,1 and your d/f+1 mix-up is.

Some good set-ups for d+2,1

-Off-axis stuns (Side-turns)
-1,2,1 or 1,2   (On hit)
-FLI 1,f+1      (Blocked)

3.2	2,1,d+2

	Few people seem to block this, probably because they are used to seeing 
the whole 1,2,1,d+2 string instead of the shorter version. This is especially 
good against people in corners, and in the crunch. 




B.	Mix-Ups

	Steve Mixing-up isn't as dangerous as Lei, Paul, or Marduk, and isn't as 
annoying as Hwoarang or Xiaoyu. This is because he lacks powerful low hits or 
near-decent grabs that makes an opponent duck on defense. His mix-ups rely more 
on his side-turns and fast strings, which sooner or later will pressure an 
opponent into reacting.

	d+2,1
	
		
	As you can see, all the starters link into a string ending with either the 
starter itself, or another starter. The good thing is if an opponent tries to 
poke in between these strings, you can parry (punch or duck-jab) or sway under 
them and CH for mad damage.				


		
						
C. Defense



1.)	Counter Hit 

		Steve has an excellent CH game thanks to his sways, his stun-
inducers, and his crazy combos after those stuns. If you're good at reading an 
opponent and anticipating his actions, then this part is payoff.

Table 1.0-c		Counter Hit


Situation					Move			Result

Opponent attacks high			3,1			Double-Over
						4,2			Double-Over
						f+1+2			Freeze Stun
						3+4~2			Crumple Fall
						b+3_4, 2		Crumple Fall
						f+3_4, 2		Juggle

Opponent attacks mid			d+1 (~b)		Crumple Fall
						FLI b+2		Crumple Fall
						(1),2,1,2		Juggle

Remember that Double-over stuns are escapable by holding f during the stun 
animation. Use the f+1+2 only out of pure desperation.


2.)	Low Block vs. Low Parry

	Against low attacks, Steve only has two options: Parry then counter with a 
Sonic Fang, or Block then counter with a WS 1,2. For Steve, it is better to 
parry quick low attacks and block those with long block stagger animations.

Table 2.0-c		Low Attack Defense

Situation				Counter With:

After Low Parry			Sonic Fang

After Block				WS 1,2



3.)	Eagle Claw vs. Sonic Fang

Table 3.0-c		Comparison of Eagle Claw and Sonic Fang


Move 				Speed		Damage  Follow-Ups  On Block

Eagle Claw (f,f+2)	14 frames	25	  Yes (FLI 2) -11 Opponent RC

Sonic Fang (d/f+1+2)	14 frames	28	  No		  -10 Guard Break

	These moves are very similar, and they are both very good. Their 
differences actually lie in their application. Sonic Fang hits rolling 
opponents, and is a good juggle ender. Eagle claw guarantees a 1+2~2 follow up, 
and is a good stun combo ender. Sonic fang is a better retaliation, while Eagle 
Claw is better as a whiff punisher. Lastly, Sonic Fang is a more suited for 
offense, as a mix-up to nail crouchers, while Eagle Claw is a better defensive 
tool due to its range and power (Eagle Claw + FLI 2 = 40 damage).   	


4.)	The Punch-Parry

	Never forget the punch parry! It is one of Steve's most powerful tools. It 
is especially important against 8-frame jabbers, and those who use predictable 
punch strings. This will save your life-> a lot. Always use this!






IV.  Character Specific Strategy


1.)Bryan Fury- The dead guy still remains a top tier character in Tekken 4,
although he seems to have slowed down a bit. His f+2,1,4 combo is
guaranteed if the first hits, and it hurts a lot. If Bryan is bulldogging
with punch rushes, parry his hands off and punish him. Sidestep his combos
since he is very linear. Attacking high is not advisable all the time since a 
crouching Bryan could give you a problem. As usual, you'd have to watch out for 
the Chains of Misery Throw and the WS moves which Byran is famous for. Attacking 
mid at the wrong time can get you out prioritized by a CH 8-frame jab string 
(ouch!) Don't be reckless in attacking Bryan, he'll punish you real bad for it. 
Whenever you get Punch Parried, hold B for Steve to automatically do a back 
sway. This would avoid the ensuing Mach Breaker follow-up, if he doesn't use the 
Gut Punch ending. Watch out for a sudden Snake Edge!
Difficulty:	Medium

2.)Christie Montiero-  Whether against a scrub or an expert, be careful.
Attacking recklessly could get you a roundhouse kick to the face. Low parry 
their kick strings, and you've got yourself a free Sonic Fang. Christie can kill 
you with her confusing low-mid strings. Christie has more mix-ups than other 
confusion characters, but her strings are very slow, so just try to read what 
your opponent is doing. Kill her immediately!
Difficulty:	Medium

3.)Heihachi Mishima-  You shouldn't have a problem here. You'll probably out
prioritize all of the old man's moves. Just don't be a fool to whiff a move or 
your ass will get juggled for some big time damage. Don't let him call out his 
Thunder Godfist variations (Omen and Sapphire Godfist). These cause guard break, 
and anyone who has mastered their motions will abuse them. 
Difficulty: Medium


4.)Hwoarang- Here's where you've got a problem. Hwoarang-Steve fights are
usually about who gets their attack strings out first. You still can't
afford to be reckless: your high attacks can be avoided by that damn E.
Coli kick (f+3~3). I found that sidestepping when you think Hwoarang will pull 
out an E.Coli will get you behind him. If you ever get
caught in his infinite flamingo strings, duck under the high hit in the
series, and punish it with WS 1,2. You'll get the offensive rhythm
after that. If you get turned around by a guard-breaking kick, don't be
stupid- just turn around and resume your guard. Else, you'll be eating a
nice, big, Backlash, and don't duck either! Better to eat a mealy d/b+4 than to 
get launched by a b+3. Try to get him cornered and bulldog him there, because 
his moves are slower than yours. 
Difficulty:	Hard

5.)Jin Kazama- Jin loves to bulldog. Playing him toe-to-toe is real fun,
although against expert players, a poking game is more suitable. Always
remember to Punch-Parry. Sidestep his 1,2,3 combo. Learn to defend against his 
Laser Cannon/Laser Scraper mix-ups. There's a whole FAQ at Tekken Zaibatsu about 
this. Don't panic when he gets into his soul omen to lingering soul power up. 
Just block and you'll be safe. Don't be foolish and rush in after Jin finishes a 
string, you'll be eating 2 nice Can-Can kicks. WS 2 will kill you so mix-up mid, 
and use your Flicker cancel which autoguards real nice.
Difficulty:	Easy to Medium

6.)Julia Chang- Not much here, just learn to defend against the mix-ups, and
sidestep her attacks. Don't be foolish with your attacking, you don't want
to eat a G-Clef Cannon on CH. Learn to break the Mad Axes throw (1+2).
Don't get caught in a elbow->jab->elbow->Mad Axes/Other Throws mix-up. That's 
real nasty. Like with Bryan, she's got a guaranteed combo on a CH 8-frame jab so 
be careful!
Difficulty:	Easy to Medium

7.)Kazuya Mishima- While he may be slower than you, don't rush in and bulldog
just yet: a WS 2 Gut Punch leads to a devastating combo. Just poke his ass off 
alternating high and mid to keep him from crouching. Parry any Shining Fists 
they plan on doing. Keep moving around instead of in and out to negate the 
effectiveness of the Crouch Dash. Learn to block the Mishima Fury combo (hhlm) 
since a TGF is pretty much guaranteed if it hits. Don't
fall for the 1,2,4 & 1,2,d/f+1,f+2 mix-up! I myself am a victim of this.
Difficulty:	Medium to Hard

8.)King- One thing you should be wary of King is when he goes into an Armor 
King-type of game. He'll use the Rolling Sabat, the Konvict Kick, the Hopkick, 
the Flying Knee, and the Dark Shoulder. The problem here? All these attack hit 
MID, which you can't sway out of, they have nice properties (the hop kick 
juggles, the Rolling Sabat is fast, the Konvict Kick chains into a DDT on CH, 
the Shoulder Ram and Flying Knee do massive damage.), they have great priority 
for power moves, and all these, you cannot parry. This one, you'll have to 
bulldog.
	Another thing: WATCH OUT FOR THESE THROWS!
			(The big 5):	-Giant Swing (45-70 dmg) 1 escape/techroll
						-Rock Bottom  (50 dmg) 1+2 escape
						-Tombstone	  (58 dmg) 2 escape
						-Muscle Buster (50 dmg) 1+2 escape
						-Frankensteiner (inescapable, 30-45 dmg)
Difficulty:	Medium

9.)Kuma/Panda-  Honestly? Bulldog. Poke them out of their Hunting Bear Stance
with your d+2.
Difficulty:	What a Joke


10.)Marshall Law-  Be careful with your attacks, a parry from Law could end up
in a painful backfist. Avoid attacking high always unless you'd want to get CH'd 
and juggled to eternity. Watch out for grab mix-ups coming from his strings, and 
don't fall for his tricks. Dragon's Tail...
Difficulty:	Hard

11.)Lee Chaolan/Violet- 	Don't get hit by the following:

			-Mist Trap	(Duck under it or it's guaranteed damage)
			-Acid Rain	(Block. Unless  you want to see a slick juggle)
			-SS+2		(~f,1,2,4:4 is guaranteed if it hits)
			-u/f+4	(Juggle starter. Lee's wall juggles hurt a lot)
Other than that, you won't have a problem
Difficulty:	Medium

12.)Lei Wulong- One of your hardest fights, hands down. Lei will drop down
under your punches, he'll guard stun and bulldog you to death. My advice?
Just stay the hell away from him. If you could force him to whiff (hard to
do), that's a good thing. Try your best to avoid his attacks, blocking them just 
won't work. One of my weaknesses is a hardcore Lei player- not just with Steve, 
but with any character I'm using (except Marduk!).
Difficulty:	Near Impossible


13.)Craig Marduk- Marduk shouldn't be much of a problem against Steve. Bulldog
him, poke him, and Throw him, since he's damn slow. The important thing you 
should remember is to mix-up your attacks high and mid, unless you want to get 
an unchickenable reversal that ends with him on top of you, or get juggled for 
50+ damage. Learn to block the mounted punches. Block the punches with 1 or 2. 
Learn to anticipate when Craig will call out a d+1+2, it launches and it ducks 
under high moves.(His only Steve killing move)
Difficulty:	Medium

14.)Nina Williams- Don't let her out poke you so she can't bring out her mix-up 
Game.  Just be smart and patient on offense so you don't get
CH'ed for a painful kick to the balls. Learn the multi-grab breaks!
Of course, since Nina isn't popular among amateurs (those dependent on multi-
grabs would rather stick to King), this means that a Nina player would most 
likely be an expert. That means he would know when to poke and when to turtle, 
and he can do it quite well. Nina pokes predominantly high, so SWAY!!!
Difficulty: Medium to Hard

15.)Paul Phoenix- Against scrubs, you can win with one hand. Against good
players, you're in for a very tough fight. Paul can sway back and avoid your 
pokes, CH-ing you for mad damage. Sway under a 1,2 abuser (watch out for 
d/f+1~>Throw setup, though). Parry a Tile Splitter the moment you see
it. Avoid getting bulldogged by repeating JFs, that's a big headache. Be VERY 
careful when attacking, b,f+1 will kill you everytime. Overall, be really, 
really careful.
Difficulty:	Hard

16.)Steve Fox-  Always a good fight. This will be either a bulldog fest or an
hour-long poke fest. Nothing much to say here, just, don't be reckless. A
single CH punch from Steve will kill you. You do have a punch parry don't
you?
Difficulty:	Varies


17.)Ling Xiaoyu- Xiaoyu, along with Lei and Hwoarang will be very hard to
fight. Her mobility will make her a very hard target. Her Phoenix stance
will avoid almost all your attacks. Of course, the strategy here is don't
get hit when she moves in to strike. Try to move around and make yourself a hard 
target yourself. Counter her pokes with your Punch Parry and Sway
moves. If you try to bulldog a really good Xiaoyu, her movement'll just
dizzy you. Apparently, sidestepping will avoid most her attacks momentarily, 
giving you just enough time to stop her with a 1,2 jab before she tracks you. 
I've found that 3+4~2 works well against Phoenix Stance abusers.
Difficulty:	Hard

18.)Yoshimitsu- Nothing much since I haven't gone up against good Yoshimitsu
players. I'll get back to you on this.
Difficulty: Medium


V.	Combos and Juggles


Starter

1,2,1,2	d/f+1,2,1,	d/f+1+2

DCK 2		3,1~b, FLI 1,1,[1],2 

CH 3+4~2	3,1~b, FLI 1,f+1, d+1

B+3_4,2	d/f+1,2,1~b FLI 1,1,[1],2

F+1+2		f,f+2, 1+2~2	(a.k.a. "The 3-hit Wonder")

CH 4,2	f,f+2, 1+2~2	

CH 3,1	~b FLI b+2

	There are other combos and combo starters, but most of them produce the 
same stun effect as the moves listed here, meaning you can apply the same 
juggles. (ex. CH DCK f+2 and CH d+1 are similar to CH 3+4~2, etc.)

	Check out Shukudai's Steve Combo movies at www.arcadepimp.com. It features 
some great and damaging juggles and combos which I did not list here. Check it 
out!

Please put "Steve FAQ", or "Steve Guide" or something like that in the
subject line.

As Kurt De la Pena says, I'm not the best Steve user in the Philippines, or in 
Quezon city for that matter. I'm just an above average player, nothing much. 
Still if you want a game, look for me in the Philippines, specifically SM 
Fairview Mall in Quezon City, Specifically the Worlds of Fun Amusement Center. 
You'll find me at the Tekken 4 machine, using Steve, Paul, or Marduk. I'm 
probably the only guy there that uses Combot.
