[History]

  [Version 0.1]
The FAQ is started. Unfortunately, Lei Wulong
won't be released in Texarkana until Wednsday, 
so I haven't had that much of a chance to play
with him yet (besides random). However, this 
is more of a starting point than anything 
else. Expect massive updates as I get more of 
a chance to play with him. Thanks for reading, 
though.

There is a basic "legend" used by all members of
the Tekken community which you should already be
familiar with. However, since some of you may be
just starting out, I'll provide one here.

this FAQ at a later date, head to

[Introduction]
Let's face it: there is no Tekken character more 
rich, more complex, or more insanely effective 
than Lei Wulong. Not only does he have power and
speed, he has more moves and stances than you can 
shake a stick at. He is as deep as you want him 
to be and as confusing as you make him.

To me, at least, Lei Wulong is just about the 
ultimate character.

In writing this FAQ, I not only hope to learn him 
better myself, but to share my unique strategies 
and insights into what makes Lei the drunken 
master he is. 

I consider myself an intermediate-to-expert Lei
player, but certainly not a master. This guide is
for all Lei players that wish to further their
knowledge and find new strategies.

Thanks for reading and enjoy.

[Profile]
Lei's life was consumed as usual by police work. 
Unfortunately for Lei, his live-in girlfriend 
got fed up with Lei's workaholic lifestyle and
dumped him in favor of Lei's assistant. 
Ironically, the assistant acted as a liaison 
for Lei whenever she wanted to get in touch with
him at work. When Lei found out about this, he 
became extremely depressed.

Around the same time, Lei botched an operation
to bring a crime syndicate to justice. Lei 
failed to capture an agent of the syndicate
who would have enabled the police to take down
the syndicate's boss. The failure cost the 
police force two years worth of intense 
undercover investigations.

Rival detectives who were jealous of Lei's
stellar case record saw this as an opportunity 
to damage Lei's career. Unbeknownst to Lei,
the rivals reported to Lei's superiors that
he botched the operation by "allowing personal 
affairs to affect his job performance." As a
result of this betrayal, Lei wound up on a 
one-month suspension from active duty.

Soon after his suspension, Lei learned 
from an informant that the syndicate was 
plotting to assassinate a boxer participating 
in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4. The 
syndicate apparently hired an assassin for the 
hit.

Lei thought that he could gain valuable 
information from the boxer about the syndicate.
If all went as planned, he could also capture 
the assassin and establish a plausible 
connection between the assassin and the 
syndicate. Lei reasoned that this would aid 
efforts to bring the syndicate down.

Lei entered the Tournament with the hope of 
redeeming his honor.

[Advantages and Disadvantages]

Like any character, Lei comes with his 
strengths and weaknesses. While I consider 
Lei the best character in the game, that 
doesn't mean he's perfect. I will now 
attempt to relate to the uninitaited 
exactly why Lei is so popular and, to 
some, unpopular.

  [Advantages]
-Lei is one powerful SOB. Moves as 
simple as the headbutt (B+1+2) can 
result in major damage, and old favorites 
like the razor rush (f, N, 1,2,1,2) can 
now be used against the wall.

-Lei can mix it up. His stances aren't 
gimmicks; they're a key part of his 
strategy. A good Lei player knows how to 
go from stance to stance quickly and 
efficiently. Also, scrubs and mashers 
will be alike when you stand back from 
the action in a beautiful crane stance, 
only to be slaughtered by a 3>4>2>3 
when they dash towards you. ;) Another 
mix-up I use often is f, N, 3_1,2,1,2. 
Since the 3 comes out so fast, a lot 
of players won't even see it coming, 
and will be expecting another razor rush.

-Okizeme, my friends. While he doesn't have
the okizeme game of, say, Nina or King, he 
certainly can hold his own. Want to really 
tick your opponents off? Try a quick B+1+4, 
d+1,1,1,1,1 as they try to get off the 
ground (by the way, no diagonals are required 
for back ducking in Tekken 4! Thank God!). 
Still trying to get up? How about a BT D+4, 
into a snake stance and a 2,2,2? Finish it 
off with an u/f+2. This can take nearly half 
of the enemy's life bar away. Of course, I 
will eventually have an entire section up 
for okizeme, but this is just a basic 
example of what I frequently use.


   [Disadvantages]
-Lei is hard to master. I haven't done it 
yet. I don't think I will anytime soon. 
There is so much to every facet of Lei. He
can be played in so many ways. I've been 
playing with him since Tekken 3, and while 
I believe I have fairly substantial knowledge 
of his abilities, I am nowhere near "mastering" 
him. I truly respect anyone that can pull 
off any of his stances, combos, or juggles at 
any moment.

-He CAN be abused. There are idiots out there 
that give Lei a bad reputation with their 
d+3+4, d+3+4, d+3+4, d+3+4 pathetic mashing, 
and while most good players can usually avoid 
it, a lot of people can't. It's frustrating. 
Therefore, you may hear your opponents sigh 
when you pick Lei. Show them what you're made 
of and keep your head up, though. Just because
 other people suck with him doesn't mean you do.

-Lei becomes tired. I played TTT nearly every day
for about a year. In this time, I became so 
hardwired on my own strategies that I would 
follow a constant pattern and strategy every 
match. This is a very bad thing to do, I realize 
now, and have tried a little more experimentation 
with him. However, I advise you now: if you play 
each match the same way, you will get bored with 
him, and so will other players. So, experiment, 
experiment, experiment!
