## T4 Kazuya Mishima txt file -






---------------------------------------------------------- A brief Introduction *

not really a FAQ(Frequently Asked Question) but more like a text file 
where I can put some thought and Ideas about this guy in tekken. :-) 
use this file in your own way. You can claim it as your own, you can 
print it and use it as toilet paper, eat it, whatever. you can even sell 
it (Although I don't think it is even worthy of it) I just want the 
information to be accessible for everyone. i don't cosider this to be 
a VERY GOOD or EXCELLEnt or whatever. It's just text files. 



----------------------------------------------------- Some bits of Introduction *

This text file is dedicated for anyone who wish to learn kazuya Mishima. 
I HOPE you know his movelist and stuff. I myself are not quite familiar
with the words representation for condition like KND and FC [until I read
them in TZ, that is...] if you don't.. go get it at 

http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com 

 or 

http://tekkencentral.com/eng

I am not paid to advertise, OK :-) but this 2 site [esp. the 1st one.. 
REALLY HELPS ME IMPROVE since I play T3]

anyway.. here's the meat of the hamburger. Hope it'll help your game. 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------- RULES *

. When you play, don't play to win, but play to learn. and for fun,
  of course. So don't take the game SERIOUSLY. it's just a game. 
  simply put: "DON'T MAKE TEKKEN TO BECOME YOUR LIFE" 
  
. When you play, play seriously. [funny, eh?] just focus and try 
  to keep your mind flowing, and watch. you have eyes, use them.

. don't get arrogant, don't limit yourselves, once you THINK you knew 
  how to use kaz, dump him. Find another char. and learn him. That way 
  tekken is a lot more fun. 

. Don't think you're the greatest tekken player on earth. That is one 
  way of limiting yourselves. 

. Don't abuse any moves/string.. you will create a pattern. 
  if someone 'notice' that pattern, that moves/custom string could be 
  used against you.. :-) unless you can utilize this situation to 
  create setups or mix-up games

. If you win, just think it is because of luck. :-) 

. I am no guru..  
  I can NEVER be a guru of tekken & I'm just a Tekken players. 




----------------------------------------------------------------------- MAIN JUGGLES.

this man is a bastard. He is a bastard. So play him like a bastard he is. 

IMO, his main stream lies in finding mistakes in your opp.'s game and 
quickly capitalizing on it. As most of you have already knew, Kazuya have 
a juggle that can take off as much as 70% of your Lifebar. And that's a lot. 
Dunno if namco will fix this later on, but it's available at the time I am 
writing this.

his strongest juggle, starts with WS+2. 

WS+2.. is now a slow cow. but a powerful ones. it's hard to land this move
consistently on a tough opp. Especially when you're under pressure and the 
battle is tense. but it lands sometimes, with luck, or even by chance or 
opportunities.. 

And Opportunities don't knock the same door twice. So..
if you EVER managed to land a (ch) WS+2, please do the following stuff: 
( These are what IMO his 3 main juggle ) 



(1) WS+2(ch) -> d/f+2 -> 3,1 -> d/f+1,F+2
-----------------------------------------
    Deals as much as 50% off the lifebar [prolly 45% or more], 
    it's VERY easy to do, provided the WS+2(ch) lands. 
    you want to play safe, use this. 



(2) WS+2(ch) -> EWGF -> f+1 -> f,f+1 -> TGF,3 
---------------------------------------------
    this is the most damaging juggle in T4 (I think) takes as 
    much as 65-70% off the lifebar. Main problem lies in landing 
    the WS+2(ch) and executing the juggle itself. Can easily miss 
    this one when you're under great pressure. If you can do this 
    very constantly, stick with this.



(3) WS+2(ch) -> WGF  -> f+1 -> f,f+1 -> d/f+1,F+2
-------------------------------------------------
    in case you miss the WGF in (2). This is your option. Don't be 
    flashy... when you're fighting real good people, you'll want 
    your juggle to be simple and effective enough so as to reduce 
    every possible risk. 




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MOVES

Every moves in Kazuya is useful, it depends on the situations and 
circumstances. I believe strongly that every move is NOT redundant.
here's some of his moves that has more potential than his other moves:


1,2
--------------
One-two jab that every one has. use it to irritate your opp. Mix 
with other jabs and stuff. 


f+1, d+4
---------------
not really a string, but a fast one. almost everyone has this. This 
is quite cheap, but you play to win. if people can't handle this, 
then it's their fault to underestimate you. if people do this to you, 
don't complain. if you know how to handle it, you can even USE it 
against your opp. (since it is so highly abusable, it's predictable)


1,1,2   
---------------
all 3 punch hits high. If the first hit lands, the rest is guaranteed, 
provided you execute it without delays. treat it as a single move, the 
first hit is about 10 frame speed. Slightly slower than Steve's jab. 


1,2,2
---------------
all 3 punch hits high. If the first lands, the rest is guaranteed; 
provided you execute it without delays. (sounds familiar?) It's exactly 
like 1,1,2 - but it deals more damage. HOWEVER, unlike 1,1,2 this move 
DOES NOT KNOCKS DOWN your opp. Your choice. :) 


1,2,4
---------------
first 2 hits high, goes to a low stature kick. usually people don't 
block the last low kick. but don't abuse it. People knows how to block
them. Unless you know your opp. is not used to this moe. 


d/b+4
---------------
the last kick in 1,2,4. Comes out pretty slow imo. But hard to detect, 
if you do 1,2,4 the 1,2 could signal the incoming 4.. 
( which is why 1,2,4 is perfect for mixups)


d/f+4,4
---------------
called tsunami kick, or AXE kick. 2 mid kick that comes out real fast. 
This one kills Steve's sways and Christie handstand. good stuff for 
okizeme. Second kick is delay-able. 


b+2
----------------
A fast overhead punch. When blocked, gives a slight Guard Stun (GS) to 
your opponents. Use this when you know people will block it, as it 
will make your opp.s option restricted only to WS moves. DUCKABLE, 
so don't abuse it.


b+1
----------------
overhead elbow. Gives slight guard stun and makes people ducks a little 
when it is blocked, similar to b+2. However, b+2 has more range and hits 
high, while b+1 hits mid and has restricted range. your choice. 


d/f+1
----------------
somewhat this move alone is useful. gives guard stun when blocked, gives 
advantages to NONE. [not you, not the enemy] something like to keep the 
flow of the battle at your hands, can be effective at times. 


d/f+1, F+2
----------------
2 power moves linked together, guaranteed on ducking opponents, I think.
Quite powerful, push opp. off when blocked. d/f+1 comes out quite slow, 
use with caution. good for high/low mixup game. e.g: 
1,2,4 or 1,2 -> d/f+1,F+2


WS+2
----------------
hits mid, on (ch) gives crumple or whatever stun it is, it's inescapable kind
of stun. comes out slow from FC position. looks promising but is not 
as reliable as it appear, use with extreme caution. hard to land on tough 
player, but very rewarding if it hits on (ch)


d/f+2
----------------
Similar to WS+2, comes out a little bit faster, but gives crumple over stun. 
inescapable if hits on (ch) just like WS+2. it's just that this is more 
practical, can be executed from standing position... but less rewarding if hit. 

	when you got this on (ch) use 
  	(ch)d/f+2 --. 3,1 --> d/f+1,F+2



TGF [CD+1]  , WGF [CD+2] , HS [CD+4,4]
--------------------------------------
use it like in TTT, but with the following notes: 
TGF is a lot more faster now, can be even used as custom string. 
WGF hits high, juggles on (ch) don't make this your main moves.
HS ... is still as useful as ever. it's the only powerful low attack
that kazuya has. don't overuse all 3 of this. it's so common it is 
now a clichè. :-( 


CD+3
----------------
A flying kick. Hits high, duck-able, punishable if blocked. Cover 
great distance, deals an 'OK' kind of damage. use this to cover 
distances. 


SS+1+2
----------------
his only sidestep attack. use it if you know it'll hit. Makes opp. 
in good position for okizeme games. 


.. can't think of anything else no more ( ^__^ )
but kaz has more options definitely. get his movelist and start exploring!!










------------------------------------------------------------------------------- STRATEGIES

.. something to keep in mind while playing..

. If you have trouble fighting a particular character, it doesn't mean that the 
  character [steve, jin..whatever] is lame. it means that you're not used with 
  his styles yet. Instead of cursing, go find a thread on that character and start 
  learning him. That is the fastest way to discover your opponents's strength and 
  weaknesses... plus you got yourselves another character to play on!!

. people always create custom strings. Custom string has pattern, when you see this
  pattern, quickly remember it and find ways to work around it. No matter how many 
  round it takes, as long as you can recognizes and see this 'pattern' you'll win 
  eventually. 

. so, don't rely on custom string. Poke to irritate opp. attack during opportunities 
  and whiffs. WGF is good for this, so does his jabs like 1,1,2. 

. TGF, surprisingly fast now, ducks under jabs and hit them. 

. if you have a custom string on your own, try them ONCE on your opp. That way he can't 
  remember your pattern yet, but you can see the way he reacts to your string. is he 
  prone to certain string, 

. look for the behavior of your opp., is he tend to block high, to ecade, bulldogging, 
  use lots of sidestep? is he prone to low attack? 

. moves around. use Side steps and side walks, if you're panicking, try to slow down 
  the game by moving around. 

. use walls when you're near one. you got 1+3.. use it. a 1,1,2 or 1,2,2 is almost 
  guaranteed I think. kazuya is DEADLY on a wall.

. Explore the potential of SS AFTER a techroll. This particular one is always overlooked. 
  For example, techroll with [1] and do SSR. it gives a double side-syep effect and can 
  evade A LOT of attack when you are rising. Like lei's acrobat kick.




-------------- blah blah... yadda yadda ------------------------------ SPECIFICS STRETAGIES


. if you're under pressure by JABS, TGF is good. If it's 1,2 jabs, 
  duck and give him WS+2. if it stuns, go for the damaging juggle. 
  if it doesn't, moves around and start poking 

. the point is to give pressure to your opponents. kazuya has good jabs and 
  high/low mixup. Use d/f+1,F+2 for this, deriberately make your opponent 
  to have a habit of ducking and use it to punish.

. the new string, b+3,1,4,1 is good but hard to land. use it on a corner. 
  if it lands, follow up with TGF,3. it hurts...

. twin piston [WS+1,2] is a good one to throw now and then. It's as hard to land 
  as WS+2, but it's slightly faster and it hits 2 times, explore the moves. 
  this one has a potential that is greatly underestimated. 

. use and explore b+2... this move has potential. helps giving your opp. pressure. 
  restrict your opp. to WS+2 moves. careful when you use against 
  kaz... coz he may do WS+4,4 or WS+1,2 or even WS+2
  jin... WS+1,2 or WS+1-> u/f+1+2
  and others that will make this file bigger and longer.

. against sidestepping opponents, try TGF in between the delays. 
  easier said than done. You got to try it to understand it...

. if certain move hits you often, think WHY you got hit by it. 
  I kno how stupid it may sounds, but having the answer in your head, it's a matter 
  of time for your body to start blocking your opp.'s flow. 

. if the enemy is MUCH better than you in any way... try to make him use all his 
  moves and watch them carefully. This will be your winning ticket in the next 
  5 - 10 rounds.. :-) 

. on opp. that is rising from a knock down, hell sweep is quite good. If it blocked
  quite often, it shows they are expecting HS out of CDs. use TGF instead. you got 
  nothing to lose, just try it. Once he got hit by a TGF, the guessing game can start

. 2+4 .. then WGF/EWGF. if he retaliate by doing kicks, he'll got hit. or possibly 
  back juggled. 

. 1,1 --> EWGF .. it's quite interruptable 
  d/b+4 --> d/f+2 .. same, quite interruptable. 
  these two are custom string. remember, don't abuse them

. if opponents see your custom string, be prepared to do other string to countermeasure that. 
  for example, you can do extensive f+1,d+4. When he learn to duck to block that d+4, you can 
  start doing f+1, d/f+1,F+2. Remember that d/f+1,F+2 is guaranteed on ducking opp. 
  the same concept for 1,2,4_d/f+1,F+2

. mix-up games can only be used when you're the one that is exerting pressure. 
  1,1,2 can turn the table if you;re the one under pressure, because it knocks down. 

. 1,2,2 is damaging, if it hits, do a back dash. because fast jabber can interrupt anything 
  you do to follow a 1,2,2 that lands. backdashing eliminates all possible risk, plus if 
  the enemy is doing something that whiff, you can tap that 1,1,2, or even TGF or WGF. 

. mist step -> b+3,1,4,1 look just awesome, the mist step can give you that move 
  that allow kaz to 'get in' and allow the whole combo to hit. provided it is not blocked.
  you can use 3,1(hit) --> b+3,1,4,1

. learn CD-(halt) --> WS+1,2 
        CD -> F+2 
        CD -> b+1 

. try.. 1,2 -> TGF. it work better on heihachi though. 

. if you block a low kick.. do WS+2. TRY to land WS+2 if you can... just throw it
  now and then. if it hits... wow. you are ALMOST win already. [do the main 
  juggles number (2)..scroll up to see...]






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WALLS !!!!

TRY not to get yourselves cornered. T4's wall can be VERY dangerous. [ on the other 
hand.. try to CORNER your opponents. ] and use the 1+3 wisely... 

F+2 gives that nasty stun.. 
but push you back if blocked. 

keeps pressuring the enemy with jabs. IF you ever hit him, try to knock him down. 
USUALLY, they'll try to lie down and wait for opportunities. if that's the case, 
STOMP them. if not, start okizeme'ing.. 

If you HIT them , it's actually easy to get out of the corner, because some moves 
have momentum that pushes to certain directions... so when you got your opponent, 
think hard to squeeze as many damage as you can to your opponent. 

If you find yourselves cornered, don't ever TRY that jumping b,b,u/b
you got 1+3 or 1,1,2 that can knocks down opp. If he falls near you, 
you can even use CD+3 to escape and switch sides.

almost all moves can be utilized in a corner. it all depends on situations and luck
i really like working on things in the corner because it's VERY unprectable. I once 
got a perfect by cornering my opp. Once got killed too (-__-) 

can't really explain much.. this is JUSt a text file. try them.. and explore! :-)



------------------------------------------------------------------------------- end notes...

. I make mistakes. if you want, you can correct it. 
  if you do edit it, make sure you update the DATE [it's on top of this text file
  so that we know that this file is updated] 

. just add a date on a next line, [so that we know too, how many times it has 
  been modified] 

as for that, is the end of this text file. 
keep on playing and learning! :-) hope this helps your game. 

oh, and lastly.... to all kazuya player out there... 


" TWAAAAAHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!! "
