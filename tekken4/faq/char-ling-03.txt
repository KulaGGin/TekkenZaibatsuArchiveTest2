A. WHY LING?
############

      Ling is an incredible character to learn and master. Her speed and 
style set her apart from any other character in the game. She can be played 
in a number of different ways, and still manage to win. The limit to Xiaoyu, 
put simply, is the skill of the person using her. Learning to play this 
agile, speedy, tricky character forces oneself to become more agile, speedy, 
and tricky in the mind.
      For any Jin player, a successful move repertoire might include a 
little in excess of 15 moves and a number of motions. A successful Ling 
player uses about 30 in game play. Learning her is the toughest challenge in 
the game, right next to winning with Roger. But for all the effort one puts 
in to this character, the reward is worth it. A successful Ling player is 
respected in every tournament, and should be. Learning to use her is 
something to be proud of. This FAQ will help you do just that.





B. STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES
#########################

***Strengths***
      -Incredible Speed
      -Amazing versatility
      -Useful mix-ups
      -Complexity
      -Good at every range

      Ling's strength, put simply, is the ability to function in any 
situation. She is an incredible force, but only as good as the person using 
her. I have been playing Xiaoyu for four years, and I still have to 
practice with her. She is extremely good when used to her full potential, 
which should be the goal of anyone trying to use her. Paired with the 
skills of the player (reaction time, foresight, and adaptation), Xiaoyu is 
near unbeatable.

***Weaknesses***
      -Low damage per hit
      -Smaller life bar
      -High risk character
      -Low priority moves

      A friend once told me that I have to hit an opponent 10 times in order 
to do the same damage that they inflict in 2. It's not easy being a Ling 
player! One laser scraper on a CH and she's dead. The only way to over 
come her weaknesses is simply not to get hit, which isn't the easiest 
thing to do.

      Ling's basic throw. The opponent is thrown sideways to Xiaoyu a little bit 
closer than with Jade. Great for set-ups and okizeme! Use this throw whenever 
you have the opportunity to do so. Even if the opponent breaks the throw, there's 
not much they can do after it, especially if you sidestep into Rain Dance. As long 
as your opponent doesn't duck, it's a great move to use. Look at it as a quick, 
high, unblockable move.
                              
                              
                              
F+2+4                       Jade                                     Damage: 20,10
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Nearly the same properties as Ruby. For okizeme, try cross lifting palms 
(d/f+2~1) or jump over tactics. Cross lifting palms will hit 99% of the time, jump 
over tactics are good set-ups. Note: the same tactics can be applied to the Ruby. 
Unfortunately, unlike in tekken tag, this throw is a {2} break. Don't try to 
"mix it up" with the Ruby because it's the same button break.



QCB+2                       Dislocator                               Damage: 35
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The opponent lands face up, feet away. Useful for okizeme, but a bit harder 
to pull off. For Jade and Ruby it is possible to dash in and throw. Unfortunately 
the last input of the dislocator is B, so there will be a definite pause in the 
throw execution if you try to dash in. If you do manage to land it, try a demon 
flip afterwards. Most people I've faced tend to roll away after this move. If 
they catch on, try a quick ground hit like d+4.



f+2~1                       Human Hurdle                             Damage: 15
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ling's only double button escape. It's a good four points of damage, and 
it puts the momentum of the fight on your side. Since nearly all of Ling's 
throws in the game are {2} breaks, chances are no one will break the throw. 
However, if it does manage to be escaped, block afterwards. When this throw is 
broken it leaves you at a six frame disadvantage. Use the throw when you need 
damage. It's a great way to start a fight because it puts the first few moments 
of the fight in your favor.



D/F+2+4                     Dragon Fall                              Damage: 30
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This is a great throw to use in place of the Dislocator. The opponent lands 
face up, feet away. While missing out on an extra five points of damage, you have 
the same okizeme opportunities, and you can dash in and throw without a pause. 
Too bad it is still just a {2} break.



(RD) f,f+(1+3)_(2+4)        Hop N' Throw                             Damage: 30
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      One of my favorite throws in the entire game. Absolutely wonderful to use 
in set-ups. While it still is a {2} break, most people get the timing wrong  and 
end up missing the input. Even though this throw takes an incredibly long time to 
execute, it covers a very long distance and is very confusing. Most people just 
watch Ling wave her arms about and forget to duck. Use it ONLY at long range.



(RD) f,f+3+4                Neck Squeeze Slap                        Damage: 17,30   
*Must be clean hit*    *damage is 30 if they block the first hit*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A great move if you can get the spacing right. If they block it, and it isn't 
a clean hit, Xiaoyu still has a two frame advantage to work off of. The correct way 
to counter this move is to side step. So If you are facing someone who side steps 
frequently, don't use the move! If the move hits, but it isn't a clean hit, you can 
get in a free mistrust juggle (RD 4). Use this move if you know it will touch them. 
Tip for hitting the move: use it closer than the move requires. Most times people 
hold B in order to block it, this moves their character right into position for a 
clean hit.



(AOP) (2+4)_(1+3)           Cradle Throw                             Damage: 30
*cancel input: (2+4)_(1+3)~D
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This move is more valuable than most people let on. Not because of the 
throw, but because of the throw cancel! For example, you can mix up the throw 
and the throw cancel into a Skyscraper Kick (WS+4). The sky scraper kick is 
fairly safe (and tricky), but the throw adds a certain "taunt" factor. The best 
players will poke Xiaoyu out of the roll, so use this only against intermediate 
opponents or when you have a frame advantage.



(Left) Any Throw Input      Arm Hook Toss                            Damage: 45
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      One of the best side throws in the game. It is just five points shy of a 
back throw. Plus, it is the only {1} break she has! The only downside is that it 
is very hard to follow up with okizeme. If they lay on the ground you can get in 
a demon flip (4~3). If they roll away, try a shoulder charge. Also, most of Ling's 
sidestepping techniques tend to follow counter-clockwise. Try to land this throw 
during your sidestep game. One move that connects somewhat frequently after
this move is f,f+4. Go fig.



(Right) Any Throw Input     Dump The Bucket                          Damage: 38
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This side throw won't happen as often as the arm hook toss. It does fair 
damage, but okizeme set-up is fair. It throws the opponent face down feet away. 
Most often I see people roll away from this move. Try a demon flip (4~3) afterwards. 
Most don't want to risk the standing up mixes (see mix-up section).



(Back) Any Throw Input      Crank it Up                              Damage: 50
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      It's good damage, not to mention the bragging rights connected with landing 
a back throw. The opponent ends up face up feet towards. Follow it up with some 
quick okizeme like a d+3 or a kneecap kick (d/b+4). Setups from this throw are 
hard to do, so stick with the simple damage after the throw.



***MOVES FROM NEUTRAL***

1,(2_d+2)                   Bayonet_Bayonet McTwist                  Damage: 4,7_10
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The standard in poking offense. Use both of these poking strings intermittently. 
Bayonet is fast, but the bayonet mctwist can hit crouching opponents. Also with the 
mctwist, you have the option of going into rain dance. Use these strings whenever you 
are in neutral momentum fighting. Use these moves! They're great for picking, custom 
strings, juggles, pressuring, ...!!! **More often than not I use 1,D+2 ....



1,2,1                       Bayonet, Fortune Cookie                  Damage: 4,7,17
*Fortune Cookie can be delayed*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Not much use in poking or in juggles, but great for delay and shadow baiting. 
Use the bayonet a few times in the match, and then use the bayonet, delayed fortune 
cookie. The timing takes some practice, but it's well worth it. To bait players, 
push 1 a few instants before the input window is over. Wait too long and some 
characters will jab you out of the string.



1,d+2,1+2                   Bayonet McTwist, Birds flock             Damage: 4,10,24
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Good for use in juggles. As a setup, you can try shadow baiting. Use the bayonet 
mctwist a few times, and then try the bayonet mctwist into birds flock. Be careful 
though, you're at a 17 frame disadvantage if they block. Using this move is a great 
way to lose momentum in a fight, ... if they block.



b_B+1_2                     Knifehand Reversals                      Damage: 10
*b+1_2 must hit to go into rain dance*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This move has zero range, limited damage, and an 8-14 frame disadvantage 
if blocked. If you do use this move, only use the left knifehand reversal (b+1). 
The frame recovery is much better than the right. Also, if it his, always go in 
to rain dance. Ling has frame advantage, and setup possibilities. Oh, and this
move is also good for getting out of Jin's scrapers.
      *THIS IS WRONG. USE B+2!!!!!! B+2 has a property that I did not look in
to before. B+2 pushes the opponent away when blocked (like d/f+1). Very useful.
This is good for interrupting Jin's scrapers.



d_D+1                       Sunset Fan                               Damage:  7,7,7
*d+1 recover crouching*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Slow to bring out, but good damage if the first slap hits (the near equivalent 
to a storming flower). The sunset fan pushes a blocking character away, and it ends 
in a low position, so you're fairly safe afterwards. You can use it in a wall juggle 
just like Lee's 4,4,4,  only the timing has to be a bit better. Use the move if you 
are facing a slower character, or just need that extra bit of damage. Plus it's a 
fairly decent way of getting into AOP.



d/b+1                       Storming Flower                          Damage: 25
*Horizon Taunt on CH*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The so-called "Ling's Deathfist." Good damage. Safe recovery if blocked. 
A great powerhouse move. Use it at range 2 or range 1 if you are fighting a 
slower character. If you hit someone with it against a wall it stuns them... 
more damage! The only downside to it is that the storming flower can be parried, 
reversed, and sidestepped. If you are facing someone who is good at any of those, 
be wary. Otherwise, bon appetite!



u_U+1                       Single Fan                               Damage: 5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Better range than a knifehand reversal (not much better), but slower. The 
damage is minor, but at least this has the option of going into rain dance, even 
if blocked. A good series is single fan to turning back kick (RDS f+3). One of 
the best moves to use at range 0!



d/f_D/F+1                   Belly Chop                               Damage: 10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      What a wonderful move for your jab game! It easily ducks under most 1-2 
jabs, and it's safe when blocked. Ling can go in to rain dance, or stay standing. 
The great part is that it is very hard for her opponent to tell which she's 
actually doing! Use this move! (I'll discuss using it in strings later).



1+2                         Birds Flock                              Damage: 24
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Really slow execution time, but some guaranteed damage if it hits. You can
 follow up (in most instances) with a demon flip. Besides having a slow execution 
time, it's an ok move. The recovery is just 5 frames. Not much for use in juggles,
or jabbing. But try using it after an offensive shove (d/b+3) and see how often 
it hits.    



f,f+1+2,1+2                 X Marks The Spot                         Damage: 12,27
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Another great move. It's safe, and has good damage. The first move tracks 
well because of the (f,f) motion. If the first move hits, the second is guaranteed
(usually. Sometimes if the first is a counter hit they'll stagger out of range of 
the second). Use this in combos and at range 2 or so. GREAT for juggles!



u+1+2,3+4                   Ginger Snap                              Damage: 5,8
*Guard Break*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This move was so much better in Tekken Tag. There's a guard break and a 
slight sidestep to the right. There's a 5 frame lag after the move, but you 
usually get jabbed out of it anyway. In TTT you could easily sidestep in to rain 
dance from this move, but it's much harder to now. For the damage, and lack of a 
great follow up, use this move sparingly.



u+1+2,2,1                   Double Fan Series                        Damage: 5,8,12,25
*Fortune Cookie can be delayed* *u+1+2 recovers crouching*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Another good move for delay/shadow baiting. The only danger is that this string
 is very easy to time. For that reason, use the u+1+2,2 a few times, and then try 
baiting the 1. Also, u+1+2 recovers crouching! I'll cover tactics for that in RC 
buffering later on. This move will also catch people who roll back. It will juggle
them. If nothing connects, stop at 2.



1+4                         High/Mid Parry                           Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This move is great for reasons other than damage. Nothing is guaranteed 
after the parry, but since Ling is so fast at range 0-1, she naturally has an 
advantage. This move interrupts an opponent's momentum, and is great to use in 
fear tactics. Use the move when you know you can!



2,1                         April Showers                            Damage: 8,10
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      All the good things of a belly chop, but with a jab in front! Unfortunately, 
you won't duck as many jabs with this series then as you would with the plain belly 
chop. Good for poking, ok for setups. It's much harder to recover mentally after 
blocking a belly chop than an april showers. A fairly good move nonetheless.                                                 



d/f+2~1                     Cross Lifting Palms                      Damage: 15,12
*Juggles*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Contrary to Tekken Tag, this move now causes a guard break! If your opponent 
manages to block the move, they'll only be able to score a few jabs. Good for close 
range mix-up and pressuring. As with and juggle launcher, you can follow up with 
more damage. View the combo section for details. And remember! If the first hit 
connects, the second hit is guaranteed.                                        



d/f+2                       Butter The Bread                         Damage: 15
*Juggles on BT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This really needs to be added to my moves list. There is a setup which
you guys need to know about. This is something you don't know about. D/F+2+4,
d/f+2. Also, RD 4 (BT opponent), d/f+2. If the opponent does an instant stand
up (which is common), he will get juggled. Without this setup, don't use this
move. Well, try not to anyway...


WS+2_WS+2*                  Sunflower_Delayed Sunflower              Damage: 12
*Juggles on counter hit_Juggles*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      These moves can be used, but don't use them too often. Fair to use in 
strings, duckling tactics (see below), but somewhat hard to use as Juggle 
starters. The delayed version can actually be used with some comfort! 
People who aren't used to Ling will duck whenever she pauses like that. 
But you've got to make them scared to crouch jab first (see fear game).                               



WC (d/f_D/F)+2,1            Lotus Twist                              Damage: 10,15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A great series for set-up and duckling pocking. The shady lotus (WC d/f_D/F+2). 
More often then not the move scares people in to blocking more than they have to. 
A lotus twist ending in crouching rain dance is great for a reverse hop kick_throw 
mix-up.



f,f+2>1                     Hydragea, Fortune Cookie                 Damage: 12,21
*Fortune Cookie is delayable*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Good for use at long range. Good tracking because of the (f,f) input. On a 
counterhit, both moves are guaranteed. Hard to use effectively at baiting, so use
it as a string when you are expecting a counter hit. Since it is fairly safe, use
it when you want to. Just be careful of reversals and parries.



3_f+3                       Power Crescent_Adv. Power Crescent       Damage: 25
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      If you use either of these moves, use the regular power crescent. The 
recovery is twice as good, and there are some evasion properties to the normal 
power crescent. Good damage, and a possible follow up of a demon flip. Don't use
this move against the faster characters though, they'll launch you in a second.



d+3,4                       Low Sweep, High Roundhouse               Damage: 8,18
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      If the first hits, the second can not be ducked, parried, or reversed. Good,
except that the lag on the second hit is very bad, even if blocked. So bad, some
characters can launch you. Use the first hit of this move if you are going to use
it at all. The first move gives you a 6 frame advantage if it hits (which it 
usually does).


f,f+3                       Raccoon Swing                             Damage: 13
*Opponent shows side on CH*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Another great distance move. And better yet, on a counter hit a mistrust 
is guaranteed (RD 4). A great move to enter rain dance, and rain dance canceling. 
A good move to throw out there from a distance, to test the waters so to speak. 
Also, you may want to develop some counter hit baiting techniques designed for 
this move.



WC 3,2_WC 3,2,1,4           Fire Dance_Fire Dancer                   Damage: 8,6_8,6,6,12
*Mistrust (4) can be delayed*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The firedance is a great move for duckling picking, and has excellent range. It is 
also a great way to get in to rain dance from range 2. There is no frame lag at the end 
of the move, even if blocked. The firedancer can be used for delay/shadow baiting. Unlike 
in TTT, a counter hit does not guarantee that all four hits will connect. Keep in mind 
that if the mistrust at the end of the fire dancer is blocked, you'll be vulnerable for 
18 frames.



d/b+3                       Offensive Shove                          Damage: --             
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A good move for interrupting another player's momentum. It is unblockable, 
and it gives a 4 frame advantage to whoever uses it. A x marks the spot (f,f+1+2) 
is fairly safe after this move, and so is a storming flower (d/b+1). Use this move!



4~3                         Demon Flip                               Damage: 30
*d+1+2 to AOP*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
      One of the best new moves in Ling's arsenal. A 2 frame advantage when 
blocked! The move can go in to AOP, RC buffering, and has uses in set-ups and 
parry baiting. Another great move to use at a far range. Unfortunately, the demon 
flip doesn't track well. Be careful of side steppers. Going in to AOP after this 
move will evade crouch punches. Note: Going in to AOP in this move will prevent
the demon flip from hitting grounded opponents. Get around this by going in to
AOP RIGHT after the move is done.



SS+4                        Parting Sweep                            Damage: 16
*Floats on CH*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A great low move for some good damage. Slow execution time, but a float on 
a counter hit! And there are some evasion properties to the move! But as with 
several low moves, if it is parried or block, prepare for immediate and 
destructive reciprocity (bad stuff).



f,f+4(~4)                   Step Kick                                Damage: 25
*d+1+2 to AOP*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Another move that should only be used at a distance. The move doesn't track 
as well as other (f,f) motions because of the long execution time. However, if 
this move is blocked, there is nothing your opponent can do to immediately damage 
you. Use it when you know it will at least touch them.



(u/b_u_u/f)+3               Pirouette Kick                           Damage: 30
*d+1+2 to AOP*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ling's old AOP move now in standing. Always go in to AOP after this move, 
because the recovery is much better. If your opponent has a hard time hitting 
you in AOP, use this move more often. It's a fairly good move to get in to AOP 
close to your opponent... if they have problems hitting you.



d/b+4                       Kneecap Kick                             Damage: 10
*Kickout on CH*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A fair low move. No evasion properties, slow execution time, horrid 
recovery. But on a CH there's some extra damage. You actually can CH bait this 
move with something like bayonet mctwist facing forward (1,D+2) to the kneecap 
kick. In normal play though, don't use the move. It's too much risk for too 
little damage.



(u/b_u_u/f)+4               Cyanide                                  Damage: 25
*d+1+2 to AOP* *floats on CH* *Optional RC recovery*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This move actually recovers better when Xiaoyu does not go in to AOP, so 
keep that in mind. A good move for setups, but the lack of range and slow 
execution time prevent it from being a good neutral momentum fighting weapon. 
Developing set-ups for this move will greatly improve your game.
      *Alright... there is some difference between u+4 and u/f+4. u+4 is a 
ten string starter and does a little bit different damage than u/f+4. Thank
you for bring this typo to my attention, Adrian (Aussie Dude).



b_B+4                       Twin Phoenix                             Damage: 13,15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Not an entirely useless move! If the first hit connects, the second is 
guaranteed! That's a fast high move with 28 points of damage guaranteed if hit! 
And if blocked, there is the risky set-up of doing a california roll (RDS f+3+4), 
most of the time it's safe. Use this in your jabbing game.



WC d/f+4,4                  Flower Garden Series                     Damage: 6,10
*First hit ends in AOP*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      One of my all time favorite moves in the game. If the first hits, the second 
is guaranteed. Both hits connect low. Great for the low portion of the low-mid 
mix-up game. Almost impossible for even a good player to parry. Safe when blocked. 
Use it frequently in duckling picking. Use it frequently, period!



WS+4                        Skyscraper Kick                          Damage: 14
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      I love this move! Great for the mid portion of the low-mid mix-up game. If 
it connects, a demon flip is guaranteed. Safe if blocked, too fast to sidestep, 
and fair damage. The skyscraper kick is the perfect move to set momentum in your 
favor. Develop set-ups to this move... see RC buffering, AOP canceling, and 
mix-up game.



4                           Lifting Foot                             Damage: 15
*Juggles on CH*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Too slow and too risky to be of much use to anyone. The damage isn't great, 
and the juggle only comes out on a counter hit! There are much better things you 
could be doing in those 16 frames. But still, there are set-ups you can use to 
include this move.



b,b~u/b                     Wall Climb                               Damage: 15
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      One of my favorite general additions to Tekken four. Ling's wall climb 
puts her in RDS fairly close to her opponent, sometimes even behind them. Master 
the timing of this move, and you will feel much more comfortable around walls. 
If her opponent blocks this move, they have no frame advantage over you at all!



***SPECIAL MOTIONS FROM NEUTRAL***

d+1+2                       Art of Phoenix                           Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      An extremely evasive move with the potential to cause major damage. This 
motion ducks under high moves and allows for fast low and mid moves. Everybody 
who plays against Xiaoyu fears this move, and for good reason. It completely 
eclipses the jabbing capabilities of every character in the game. 


f+1+2                       Clockwise Cartwheel                       Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A very good evasive move from range 1. It is great to use in set-ups 
because of the potential for major damage. If the cartwheel manages to evade a 
move with a fair amount of lag, it is a free mistrust juggle (RDS 4). Also, as
a neat little hop n throw setup... f+1+2, *RD* f+3+4, RD f,f+1+3 . I've hit
it against some mean competitors, give it a shot. Worst case scenario... you
get your ass kicked.


b+1+2                       Hypnotist Walk                           Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Not great for evasion, but super for mix-up! See Hypnotist canceling for 
details. Usually people will freeze up when the see this move, out of fear for 
the spinsticker and power spinstrike. For evasion, the immediate spinsticker 
does work quite well. But may I suggest a hypnotist walk cancel to a throw_cross 
lifting palms (d/f+2~1).


3+4_d+3+4                   Spinner Dodge                            Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Not much use for evasion, you just as well use a sidestep. One trick I do 
use this for is throwing. People will block after this move (from blocking 
Julia's string from her spinner move), so you have a fair shot at getting in 
a throw! Expert players know this trick and instinctively duck, which is always
keen for a d/f+2~1! It works! Also, use the d+3+4 for sidesteps!


f+3+4                       Counter-Clockwise Dive                   Damage: --
*Recovers crouching_rain dance crouching*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A fair move for evading low attacks, but a slower execution time than the 
cartwheel. Plus this move recovers rain dance crouching, which makes it hard to 
move around afterwards. However, you can still input an immediate mistrust 
(RDS 4) after the move. Also, this move does step counter-clockwise, a direction 
which evades more moves than clockwise.


b+3+4                       Sidestep Rain Dance                      Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      One of the greatest moves in Tekken Tag, toned down for Tekken 4. There's 
still some use in evasion tactics however, just not as much as in the previous 
game. Use the move! It still works at range 0, especially when the opponent tries 
for a 1,2 jab string (the move sidesteps counter-clockwise!).


f,f+3+4                     Overhead Flip                            Damage: 25  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A great way to get into range 0-1 from far away, that's if they don't 
sidestep the move. Great recovery if it hits them, fair recovery if they block. 
Another weapon in Ling's distance arsenal!


FC,d/b+3+4                  Crouching Backturn                       Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      One of the greatest moves to use for confusion effect. This is one of the 
lesser known moves that Ling has. People who've never seen it before *and there 
are many of them* get seriously confused by it. And this move also allows a 
person to get in to rain dance from crouching fairly safely too! Pushing ~f 
or ~b after the move Ling will go in to neutral (rain dance cancel).


(d/b_d/f)~N~D+3+4           Neutral Backspinner                      Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A relatively unknown move. Even I didn't know about it until just a few
minutes ago. It's just like the backspinner from Rain Dance except it is from
neutral. Neato, huh? Button execution time is a pain, but it's nothing worse
than Law's ground slide. Use it for spacing, turtling, and maybe even a little
bit of showboating.
*Credit goes to Maynard from OSU--


1+3+4_2+3+4                 Horizon Taunt_False Greetings            Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The taunts are one of the funniest tricks Ling has. The classic use for 
them is taunt baiting. The taunts can be cancelled any time, so when someone 
charges in after being insulted by the move... instant damage.



***MOVES FROM RAINDANCE***

1                           Reverse Elbow                            Damage: 22
*Stuns on CH*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A great move, if you can hit it. Great to use in CH setups. A mistrust 
juggle (RDS 4) isn't guaranteed if you manage a CH, but it is likely. 
Unfortunately, the move has extremely bad recovery when blocked, and a 
back throw is possible.



d+1_2                       Low Punch                                Damage: 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This move hits low! Not special mid! Use it frequently! It's great for 
low picking, and it recovers crouching! Even if your opponent manages to block, 
your recovery time is too fast for them to do anything. Just beware of low 
parries.
      *A quick afternote: If you are facing some really tough competition, try
not to abuse this move. It's 3 inflicted damage versus being parried and 
juggled for 50 points of received damage. Not good. Unless you are confident
you can land 20 low punches!



2,1>4                       Dark And Stormy Series                   Damage: 10,10,15
*Mistrust (4) can be delayed*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      No launcher guaranteed off of a CH, but this move is great for shadow/delay 
baiting. Unfortunately, if the mistrust is blocked they have a free juggle 
opportunity. You're better off using the backhand or the dark and stormy. 
Great for your jab game.


3                           Horse Kickout                            Damage: 16
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A fun little setup move. You can catch an opponent run into a kangaroo 
kick after this move. Another fun setup is when the opponent is grounded and 
you are in rain dance. This move will carry you out of range of a rising 
kick. Free mistrust juggle!


f+3                         Turning Mid kick                         Damage: 25
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Great damage, fast, and fair recovery. Good use in juggles, and in regular 
picking. An example string would be bayonet mctwist (1,d+2) to the turning mid 
kick. Some ok okizeme opportunities afterward, if you are fast enough!



d_D+3                       Back Circle Breaker                      Damage: 15
*Kickout on CH*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A good low move from rain dance. Use the D+3 more often because the 
recovery is better. No fantastic uses in set-ups, mix-ups, or juggles, but still 
a great move to know for certain situations!

f,f+3                       Peg Leg                                  Damage: 20
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A great move for set-ups, and has fair damage too! A peg leg to kangaroo 
kick_ california roll,d+1 is a wonderful string to use! This move also hits 
grounded opponents. And in some cases, you can even use it for jump over tactics!


4                           Mistrust                                 Damage: 16
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      By itself, not a super move. You're much better off using a reverse hop 
kick. However, this move is fast enough to use on a CH stun. I repeat! Do not 
use this move unless it is in a set-up or at the tip of its range! The recovery 
is horrible if it is blocked!
      *This move is the bulk of my juggle game. IT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE, but it
is. Many Ling players don't use this move outside of setups. I do. Go fig.
Really, people should use the hopkick from AOP rather than this move.



d+4                         Offensive Shove                          Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A tiny bit slower than the offensive shove from neutral. Plus this move 
isn't as great at interrupting the opponent's momentum as a backhand slap 
(RDS 2) or a low punch. Use the move sparingly.
      *This move is faster than from TTT. I'm still shaky on using it. The
move can be parried and juggled against. AND FOR NO DAMAGE? Don't use against
the best tekken players.


d/b+4                       Turning low kick                         Damage: 10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      More damage than a low punch, and better range. However this move is just 
slightly slower, and is easily sidestepped. Plus the recovery isn't as good on a 
hit. But, it is still good for picking!
     *Ehhh... don't really use this move against the better players. Look
up to the offensive shove comment.



***SPECIAL MOTIONS FROM RAIN DANCE***

d+1+2                       Art of Phoenix                           Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Better than the AOP motion from neutral for one reason, moves can be 
immediately entered after d+1+2 in rain dance. Also, this move adds to your 
confusion game from rain dance. See Rain Dance -> AOP tactics section.



3+4_d+3+4                   Spinner Dodge In_Out                     Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A longer sidestep than the one from neutral, but it can be easily jabbed 
out of. Some use in set-up game, just as with the spinner dodge from neutral. 
However, your opponent needs to be intimidated beforehand.



b,N~3+4                     Spinner Dodge Away                       Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A tougher input than the spinner dodge away in tekken tag, but it is still 
manageable with practice. Perfect for use in set-ups, specifically evasion baiting. 
If an opponent is caught whiffing a pair of jabs during this move, there's a free 
mistrust juggle.



B+3+4                       Double Spinner Dodge Away                Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Harder to use for evasion baiting because the move takes longer to execute. 
Good to use if you ever need to break away from the action. Some people are better 
fighters at range 2-3, and this is a move they need to keep in mind.


f+3+4,3~4                   California Roll, Kangaroo Kick           Damage: 25
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Both of these moves are excellent! The california roll in itself is her 
best set-up move from rain dance! The kangaroo kick is a damaging mid attack 
that juggles.  The california roll can put Xiaoyu in range 0-1 with relative 
ease, and the kangaroo kick can lead to major damage! Good follow-ups to the 
Cali Roll include RDS d+1, RDS 2, or the roo kick.


 
f,f+3+4                     Reverse Overhead Flip                    Damage: 17
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A great move from range 2-3. If it hits, a guaranteed mistrust. If it is a 
clean hit then it is a throw, even if it is blocked. Frame advantage even if it 
isn't a clean hit and blocked. Use the move when you know it won't be sidestepped!




1                           Left Handful                             Damage: 7 
*Recovers Crouching*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A great move for recovery baiting. At first glance, an opponent might rush 
in after blocking this move and catch skyscraper kick in the gut. The move by 
itself is reliable and safe, and should be considered whenever Xiaoyu is in AOP.


2,1                         Right Handful, Fortune Cookie            Damage: 12,15
*Fortune cookie can be delayed*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The greatest move Ling has for delay baiting, because it is so unfamiliar 
to opponents. A great set-up that leaves her at a fairly safe recovery afterwards. 
There is even some use for this move in combos, and in your jab game! Many people
will get hit simply beacuse the first hit looks like the left handful, which
doesn't have a fortune cookie that follows it.


1+2                         Wave Crest-Quick                        Damage: 14
*Immediate input after entering AOP*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Good evasion properties for a juggle. A great use for this move is ducking 
under 1,2 jabs and coming up from AOP for a juggle. Shaky recovery at the end, 
so save this move for range 1 and not range 0. Try a bayonet mctwist to this move!


1+2                         Wave Crest-Power                         Damage: 16
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Be careful when using this move. It is faster than the wave crest-heavy, 
but the hopkick is even faster. The hopkick does similar damage, and is 
safer as a class 2 launcher.


d+1+2                       Wave Crest-Heavy                         Damage: 25
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Slow execution time, but safe recovery and excellent juggle opportunity. 
The "charging" animation looks as if Xiaoyu might go low, which adds some 
confusion factor to this move.


3                           Knee Stabber                             Damage: 15
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      For being a cumbersome low move, this does have some use. Unlike the 
firecracker, this moves stays in AOP. The move hits more often than not, and it 
has some excellent follow-ups!


u/f+3,(3_4)                 Jumpkick, (Thrustkick_Hopkick)           Damage: 15,(23_25)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The best launcher Xiaoyu has from AOP because of its speed and follow ups. A 
jumpkick to hopkick is safe, while a jumpkick is an easy juggle opportunity. Definitely 
to be considered when in AOP.
      *THIS SHOULD BE THE BULK OF LING'S JUGGLE GAME. Quickly go in to AOP and then
come up with the hopkick.


(u_u/f)~N,3                       Pirouette Kick                           Damage: 30
*~d+1+2 to AOP (works for u+3 only* *Opponent back turned when hit*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      An old move refurbished into a new and wonderful weapon. Because this move 
can go directly back in to AOP, the recovery is great. Plus, if this move hits 
(and you are fast enough), it is a free juggle opportunity.


U/F>N,3                     Phoenix Hopsweep                         Damage: 19
*Recovers crouching* *floats*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The phoenix hopsweep is a wonderful tool when use correctly. Excellent 
players can easily block this move, so switch it up with the crane kick! But 
I have caught people trick to rise and sweep me out of AOP when grounded with 
this move.


U/F>4                       Crane Kick                               Damage: 25
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A good mid move to mix-up with the hopsweep. It is a safe move to use, and 
will hit frequently against good players (with the proper set-up). Plus, this 
move does fair damage too! It even causes a wall stun under the right 
circumstances. The only downside, very long execution time.



3+4                         Chang Cannon                             Damage: 12,18,14
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      One of Ling's new moves. It has some advantages in her jab game, even though it 
is a juggler. On a counter hit, the juggle is guaranteed if the first hit connects. 
If it isn't, the opponent is pushed away by the last kick. If nothing else, this 
move is safe.


4                           Flower Kick                              Damage: 23
*~b to rain dance*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A powerful mid move from AOP that has the option of entering rain dance. 
This move is strong enough to cause a wall stun, so keep that in mind as well. 
A little shaky on the recovery, so use this move somewhat sparingly.


f+4,4                       Flower Garden Series                     Damage: 7,10
*First hit ends in AOP*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      One of my favorite moves. If the first hit connects, the second is 
guaranteed. Great mix-up with the sky scraper kick, and so forth. From AOP this 
move is a bit more of a risk, but don't let that stop you from using it in custom 
strings.


u_U+4                       Flower Power_Tricky Flower               Damage: 8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Another good move to use in custom strings. The move recovers crouching, 
so keep it in mind when RC buffering. This move can go in to rain dance, AOP, 
or recover crouching. An extremely versatile move!



4~3 [~U_D]                  Firecracker                              Damage: 15
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      An excellent, fast low move from AOP. Fairly safe, even if blocked. If the 
move connects, you even stand a fair chance of landing a grounded sweep. Some 
definite use in jab game and set-ups. Also great to use against opponents who 
have frozen up from a confusion game.



***Special Motions from AOP***

1+3_2+4 [~D]                Cradle Throw Clockwise [cancel]          Damage: ~~
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      See throw section. Use this move for confusion and set-up, but little else. 
Good to mix-up with the cancel to skyscraper kick (WS+4). Keep in mind that the 
throw will rarely ever hit an experienced player.



f+3+4 [~D]                  Forward Roll [AOP]                       Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A good move to use in set-ups. Easy to follow up with either a skyscraper 
kick or a firecracker. Because the move looks like it will hit low, the skyscraper 
kick will hit more often. Another good move to use at a distance.



b+3+4                       Rain Dance                               Damage: --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A very confusing move to use from AOP. You'll most often see people freeze 
up after this move in order to see what you'll do next. Great opportunity for a 
throw or a safe move from rain dance.



u                           Stand Up                                 Damage: --
*Recovers Crouching*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A great move for RC buffering. This move is a fast way to use WS and WC 
moves from AOP in a quick fashion. Always keep this in mind when you need to 
escape quickly from AOP. It is also very fun to use in your confusion game as 
well.





E. HELPFUL HINTS
################

E1*.Button Buffering
--------------------

     God, why did I not include this earlier? This is a really easy way to improve your
level of play. When I learned how to do this I went from noob to veteran. I make referrences
to button buffering throughout this FAQ but I have not added a section dedicated to explain
it.
     Button buffering is using a previous command to execute the next command. The example
that I use most is: 1,[2], f,f+1+[2]. In layman's terms it means do I 1,2 combo and hold 
2 after you press it. Then push f,f+1 while STILL HOLDING 2. Computer thinks that you
have just input f,f+1+2. That simple. You will never mess up on button commands ever
again.

Other examples-
:D/F+[1], f,f+[1]+2
:[D]/B+[2], [D]+1+[2] (AOP)
:d/b+[3], b+[3]+4 (RD)
:[2]+[4], [2]+3+[4] (taunt)

     The other method in button buffering I'll just call inert button buffering. It is 
holding a button that has nothing to do with the comand just entered. I will use this 
'()' symbol to indicate the move will not actually appear on the screen. For example,
1,2~([3]), b+[3]+4. Layman's terms again... do a 1,2 jab and push 3 immediately after
the second jab. The move 3 (which is a kick) will not be shown on screen because it
was input before Ling could reset to active. So there you are, buffering a 3 when
you never used a move that required 3.

other examples- 
: D/F+1~([3]), b+[3]+4
:[d]+4~([1]), [d]+[1]+2
:f,f+3~([1]), d+[1]+2

     The applications of button buffering in tekken are immense and can be used by any 
character in any situation. There are damn near infinite many ways to button buffer in
combinations. Discover your own combinations and use them in play. Eventually you don't
even think about buffering, it just comes naturally. 



E1. Rain Dance Canceling
------------------------


      While moving out of rain dance, there is a period of time during the animation 
when you are in neutral position and active! For example, while canceling rain dance 
by holding [B]: as soon as Xiaoyu is barely facing forward, she is able to do neutral 
moves! Even though she's still in the canceling animation. This is especially valuable 
in Tekken 4 because he canceling animation runs much faster than in Tekken Tag.

      Rain dance canceling by holding [B] puts Ling in neutral and holding [D/B] puts
her in WC (ducking).

Rain Dance Cancel Neutral: Uses in CH baiting, RD okizeme, sidestep/evasion, and safety.

-D/F+1 (hits), d/f+1 (blocked) ~B, f,f+3
-f+2~1, B, 4~3
-(RD) SSR, [B], [B]+3+4, SSR...
-d/f+1, B

      Rain Dance Cancel Ducking: Uses in duckling picking, evasion baiting, confusion, 
and safety. This cancel is faster, and moves farther than the standing cancel. Keep in 
mind that this can essentially be used in RC buffering.

-2,1, D/B, WC D/F+2
-1,d+1, D/B, WS+4
-d/f+1, [D/B], [D/B]+3+4
-f,f+3, D/B

      *Rain Dance Canceling Forward: I never mentioned this, to my detriment. But here
it is. U/F. That's it. Ling just turns around to face forward. It takes a few more
frames to work (if you input a comand to soon, Ling will attack to the side). This is
something I hardly use because it is just a TINY bit to slow to avoid jabs. Plus I
can't go in to duckling fom it.

      *Rain Dance Canceling By Low Parry: This is something I should have told you 
about a long time ago. You can cancel a RD by doing a low parry (d+1+4). Ling can
either go in to duckling or standing by how long you hold down. This was BIG in TTT but
kind of fell by the wayside in T4. BTW, this works for any low parry (Not like they 
exist in T4, but hey!)



E2. Rain Dance/Crouching to AOP Cradle Roll
--------------------------------------------

      A helpful tidbit about Ling is that she can instantly execute moves in AOP from 
RDS and crouching. For example, if she enters AOP from neutral, she can't go in to a 
cradle throw. The input will produce a flower kick (AOP 4) instead. On a side note, 
this trick won't work in crouching rain dance.

AOP transition from RD: Uses in sidestepping, confusion, low picking, evasion, and 
safety.

-b+3+4, d+1+[2],[2]+4 [~d] ...
-RDS taunt, d+1+[2],[2]+4 [~d] ...
-d/f+[1] (hit), d+[1]+2, [1]+3 [~d], d+1
-f+1+2, d+1+[2], [2]+4 [~d] ...
-f,f+3, d+[1]+2,[1]+3 [~d] ...

AOP transition from crouching: RC buffering, duckling picking, safety, and 
"AOP death roll".

-AOP [1], d+[1]+2, [1]+3 [~d]...
-AOP [1], d+[1]+2, [1]+3 [~d], d+1
-f,f+3, [D/B], [d]+1+[2], [2]+4
-AOP [2]+4, [d]+1+[2], [2]+4, [d]+1+[2]



E3. Hypnotist Canceling/Tactics
-------------------------------

      The hypnotist stance is the least used of Ling's stances because there aren't 
many moves that you can use from the stance. Hypnotist canceling is a way to use the 
stance and its evasive properties without the lack of options.

      During the hypnotist animation, you are able to perform any move at any time 
(except a right jab or a birds flock). However, in the early frames of the hypnotist 
walk (when the computer is open for an immediate spinstrike), very few moves are 
allowed. The way to overcome this obstacle is by quickly pushing forward or backward 
after entering the stance.

Uses for regular hypnotist canceling: confusion, throw setup, and evasion.

-[b]+1+2>[b]+3+4
-b+1+[2]>[2]+4
-b+1+[2]>f+1+[2]

Uses for immediate hypnotist canceling: same uses as regular canceling, plus the 
hypnotist dance.

-b+1+2~b,B (block)
-b+1+2~b,1,2
-b+1+[2]~b~b+1+[2]~b~b+1+[2]~b  cont.

      One tactic that is great for Xiaoyu is to constantly stay in Hypnotist, canceling 
SSL in to another series of Hypnotists. The SSL to Hypnotist is a good double sidestep, 
and a good change up for the SSR double sidestep (SSR, b+3+4).When an opponent nears, 
or tries to attack, cancel with a pair of jabs. If an opponent misses, free juggle or 
throw attempt for Ling. Even if an opponent manages to catch Ling just right, she 
can still block from Hypnotist. Staying in Hypnotist throws off your opponent's game. 
Linear moves (such as the Deathfist) become useless. With the added bonus of a 
spinsticker hitting an opponents side. The constant hypnotist walk is safe and 
extremely fun to use. 
      Be careful though of characters with a fast forward right kick (4), or any move 
with good tracking left. Heihachi's right kick won't hit, but Law's sure will. As 
with any tactic, you can not rely on it completely. You can actually bait a fast 
tracking left hit, and SSR to rain dance. Use the Hypnotist for a good number of 
seconds, and then move on to something else.

Tricks from the constant hypnotist walk:

-SSL~b+1+2, SSL+4
-SSL~b+1+2, D/F+1, SSL~b+1+2
-SSL~b+1+2, 1,2
-SSL~b+1+2, SSL, 2+4
-SSL~b+1+2, SSL



E4. AOP Canceling
-----------------

      AOP canceling is a great way to immediately go in to WS (while standing) or 
WC (while crouching) moves. By lightly tapping [u], she is able to instantly RC 
buffer. Keep in mind that the rain dance/crouching to AOP to AOP cancel would be 
almost instantaneous.

-AOP u~n WS+4
-AOP u~n WS+2_2*
-AOP u~d+3,2

Plus a little maneuver that is extremely confusing...

-AOP u~d/b+3+4,d+1+2~u~d/b+3+4...

      That little "duckling" dance is great for catching an AOP 4~3, or a RD d+3_d/b+4. 
Of course, you won't do the entire notation. Use the dance until your opponent 
freezes.

      Another interesting way to cancel AOP is to go in to crouching rain dance. While 
in AOP push d/b+3+4. Continuing to hold d/b will put Ling in to a rain dance cancel 
*crouching. Good for confusion tactics and evasion baiting.

-AOP [d/b]+3+4, [d/b], [d/b]+3+4
-AOP [d/b]+3+4, [d/b], WS+4

	I've been practicing this some more in the recent weeks. There appears to be
more to it than I originally thought. I saw some stuff that STLbadboy was doing
at EC4 and decided to put it in here (credit given where due). AOP can go in to 
rain dance VERY fast. Much faster than I thought it did. And since RD cancels
so much faster, it almost looks like she isn't in RD at all! Try it...

-AOP u+4, [d]+1+2, [d/b]+3+4, [d/b]
-AOP d/b+3+4, RD d+1
-AOP [d/b]+3+4, [d/b], d+1+[2], AOP [2]+4
-AOP [d/b]+3+4, [d/b], [d]+1+2, [d/b]+3+4, [d/b]...*
*This may be classified as a dance or a backdash if done fast enough, but I have
never heard of a name for it. This has probably been done before, so I won't go
off and name it or anything. But if it hasn't, the LING TWISTER ^_^ lol. I amuse
myself too much.


E5. Hopling
-----------
      Very surprisingly, Ling sometimes has an advantage when she hops. When landing 
off of a hop, Ling can RC buffer. If an opponent stalls, Ling has the opportunity for 
mix-up. Plus, hopping in front of an opponent is extremely confusing. With normal 
characters it is a certain death sentence, but with Ling's pressure and fear game, 
it's very useful. But there is more to the neutral hop than just the hop. An u,n+4 
when blocked doesn't put Ling at much of a disadvantage. On a hit the frame advantage 
gives Ling some serious momentum.
      Also, Ling has a hop from AOP. There are several set-ups with the hop sweep from 
AOP (like hopping over a rising low kick). The hop sweep and the crane kick is an 
extremely good mix-up. The hop in itself is safe in the right environment. Hopping 
from AOP (unlike rain dance) can RC buffer like neutral hopping does.
      Developing several set-ups before or after a hop can increase Ling's offensive 
power drastically. See the set-up section and baiting for some ideas on the subject. 
Having two or three more set-up custom strings hurts no one except the opponent.
      There's also something called the hopling retreat. The notation is (AOP U/B, 
d+1+2, AOP U/B, d+1+2, etc). This is one of the very few turtling tactics that 
she has. Law has something like it with his u/b+3. She also has a jump back that
looks like a normal jump back from RD... the notation is (RD U/F, U/B).
A string like this will draw an opponent after Ling. Depending on the opponent's 
response, Ling can counteract for a hit.

Examples of The Hopling Method:

-u,n,WS+4
-u,N>3
-u,n, WC d/f+4,4
-u,n, d+1+2~d+1+2
-u,n, d+1+[2]~[2]+4
-AOP U,n>3_4
-AOP U,n> d+1+2,d+1+2

Examples of The Hopling Retreat:

-AOP U/B, d+1+2~1+2
-AOP U/B, d+1+2, U/F,n+3
-AOP U/B, n+4
-AOP U/B, n+3


E6. Retreating Tactics
----------------------
	This is perhaps the strangest tactic to use with Ling. Everybody who uses
Xiaoyu becomes accustomed to pitbull. She can stay in range 0 with people and just
never leave! Who wouldn't want to pitbull? But, this FAQ is designed to give as
much of an overview as possible.
	Ling does have a few moves that can retreat. It's similar to baiting, but
not quite. Baiting is one thing you can do from a retreat, but there is so much 
more that can be done! In a word, retreating is safe (against character who can
not close the gap very easily. Do not use retreating tactics against the Mishimias,
or Paul).
	Often times during a match, two characters will face off against eachother
in range 3. Ling has so many moves from that range, she has the advantage in my
opinion. And getting in range 3 isn't a piece of cake for most characters. Learn
to master the range 3 duel and retreating tactics will be your best friend.

Examples of Retreating:

-(d/f_d/b)~N~D+3+4
-Hopling Retreat
-RD d/b
-RD [d]/b, [d]+1+2, u/b
-d/f+1, RD b~N+3+4
-(d/f_d/b)~N~D+3+4, RD b~N+3+4
-(d/f_d/b)~N~D+3+4, RD B, (d/f_d/b)~N~D+3+4


E7. RC Buffering
----------------
      One of my favorite tidbits to use with any character. Move that recover crouching 
can be "buffered" in to while crouching or while standing moves. This means that any 
move that recovers crouching can near-seamlessly go in to any WC or WS move. Plus 
there are certain other moves that can be used in the same way that WS moves are used. 
It takes good timing, but it is possible. This entire method has uses in every aspect 
of Ling's gameplay. It is one of the best weapons that she has.

Moves that Recover Crouching:

-u+1+2
-u+4 [hold d]
-d+1
-d/b+2
-4~3
-SS+4
-U_U/B_U/F
-WC 1_2
-WC 3
-WC 4
-RD d+1_2
-RD D/B
-RD d/b+4
-AOP (2+4)_(1+3), [D]
-AOP f+3+4
-AOP 1
-AOP u
-AOP u+4

Moves that execute While Crouching:

-WC 3,2
-WC d/f+4,4
-WC d/f+2,1
-WC d/b+3+4
-WC 1_2
-d+1+[2],[2]+4

Moves that execute While Standing:

-WS+2_2*
-WS+4

Moves that execute with Special Properties:

-b,b+1+2
-f,f
-b,b
-u~u (SSR)
-u~u+4 (SSR+4)
-f~_u~_b~_any move



E8. Tech Catches
----------------
	Extremely valuable for okizeme. This is perhaps the best way in the game to tack
on extra damage after a juggle. Unfortunately, Ling isn't the best character in the
world at these. Tech catches are okizeme attacks performed when the opponent tech rolls
or rolls back (diehards, hang with me for a moment).
      When a character tech rolls, there a few stages to it, not just one fluid motion
believe it or not. At the precise moment of the tech roll, the character is vulnerable
to low attacks. A few frames after that, the character (during the tech roll) is
blocking low. A few frames after that, the opponent's controller takes over again and
once more can block anything with a d/b or b. The part we are most concerned with are
the frames where the other character is blocking low. Now this is all controlled by 
the computer remember, so as so as the techroll is initiated, tech catches are basically
guaranteed. Neato huh? This also works for rolling back, but I'll get to that later.


-Tech Rolls
: Tech rolls can be predicted. Just watch the opponent. Which way they tech roll is
important. In tekken, there are two tech rolls (punch tech, kick tech). Fortunately
for the purposes of guessing, EVERYONE ON THE PLANET EARTH SEEMS TO HAVE THE AFFINITY
FOR THE PUNCH TECH ROLL. Punch tech rolls are always in-screen. So if the 
opponent is on the left it is SSL and on the right it is SSR.
      Now I apologize for this next part. I'm just getting in to tech catches, so
I'll just give you one example and you can make up your own from there. Okay?

--d/f+2~1, 1,d+2, RD (SSR_SSL), RD 4
: Step by step now. First, the rising palms launcher. The opponent is turned head
towards face down. The 1, d+2 turns him head towards face up. Now, here's the
tricky part. Sidestep OUT-SCREEN (towards yourself). If Ling is on the right, SSL.
If Ling is on the left, SSR. The opponent will tech IN-SCREEN (NOBODY ON EARTH
TECHS OUT-SCREEN). You may even want to put a dash in between the 1,d+2 and
the sidestep. The mistrust (RD 4) has to be timed properly. You'll have about
a ten frame window to pull it off, which is a sixth of a second. To practice
the timing, go in to practice mode and do this string a few times. If done 
properly, the game will register the entire thing as one combo.


-Rolling Back
: Sometimes the opponent will do a quick roll away. Which is a damn smart thing
to do against Ling. More often than not I'll catch people with this zinger.
      The quick roll away is GREAT except for one small flaw. The character
performing the roll ends up in the same direction as how they landed. 
"But Justin," you ask, "how can we use this information?". I am glad you asked. 
All Ling as to do in this situation is come up with a fast attack with a fair 
amount of reach to it, that can lead in to other good stuff... from an attack
that turns the opponent over to back turned. And Ling just happens to have such 
moves. For example...

--d/f+2~1, 1,D+2,  4~3, WS+4, 4~3
: Yes! It's Ling's somersault! Upon performing this combo in the air, the 
opponent (a smart one) is thinking, "I'VE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM LING!" So
the first thing that pops in to his mind is the quick roll away. Ling 
does a tiny little damage with 1,D+2... and then a 4~3. Before the 4~3
connects, the opponent starts rolling away. AT THE SAME POINT THE OPPONENT
STOPS ROLLING, THE 4~3 connects. And what happens? Poor opponent person is
stunned while back turned, Ling is crouching. Perfect for a WS+4 in to
another 4~3. Major damage.



E9. The RD Spinner Away
-----------------------

   I'm surprised at how many people don't use this move. Even the expert Ling
players are having trouble using this move. The problem is when they try to
use the spinner away (RD b~n+3+4) they are coming out with the normal RD
spinner (RD 3+4). Here are a few tricks that will help oneself to perform the
RD spinner away without flaw.

- The main trick is to input the spinner away after a move that ends in RD.
For example, (d/f+1, RD b~N+3+4). The timing is a little bit hard to nail
down, but it only takes a couple of tries to start getting it. Here are a
few more moves that are good for the RD spinner away.

: RD 1+3+4, RD b~n+3+4
: AOP b+3+4, RD b~n+3+4
: d/f,n,d+3+4, RD b~n+3+4

The timing is the same for all three moves. My rule of thumb is to start the
input for the spinner away as soon as input is available. To practice go to
practice mode and set it to hit analysis. Perform the move and as soon as Ling
turns white, input (b~n+3+4). Try it out!





F. XIAOYU PITBULL
#################


F1. Jab Game
------------
      Ling's jab game is a whirlwind frenzy of a pitbull's delight. Her use of numerous 
fast-recovering jabs is a weapon to be feared. The purpose of Xiaoyu's jabs is primarily 
to take away minimal amounts of damage with minimal amounts of risk. A secondary 
purpose is to put your opponent in a defensive frame of mind. Use this strategy in 
the beginning and ends of a round. The jabs will keep you relatively safe while 
giving the player an opportunity to see how the opponent reacts to them. At the end of a 
round, the jab game is used to peck away the final crumbs of an opponent's life bar.
      The downside of Ling's jab game is the lack of damaging power. Sticking to fast 
jabs the entire game will allow the opponent time to adapt. Thusly, her jabs are 
limited to a minimal period of time for damage. She should not stay in this mode for 
long! Especially against characters with parries or reversals!      
      The jab game is an excellent way to make the opponent become defensive. Once 
this happens, immediately go in to her set-up/confusion strategies.

Moves to Consider:

-1,2
-1,2,1
-1,d+2
-1,D+2
-2,1 [D/F]
-D/F+1
-d/f+1
-d/b+3
-f,f+1+2, 1+2
-RDS d+1
-RDS 2
-RDS f+3
-RDS d/b+4
-WS+2


F2. Mix-ups
-----------
      Mix-ups, when used properly, provide the most amount of damage with the least 
amount of risk. Simply put, the art of mix-up is using a mid move when the opponent 
ducks and using a low move for a throw when the opponent is standing. This strategy 
employs the use of potentially high damaging mid moves and pesky, irritating low 
moves. Both sets of moves should be safe on recovery and fast. Mix-ups should be used 
throughout the entire round, when the opportunity is open. Keep in mind that mix-ups 
are most effective when the opponent is in a defensive frame of mind.
      The downside to this strategy is the loss of momentum. If the opponent guess 
Ling's mix-up correctly, she loses any opportunity to do further damage in that 
offensive movement. Plus, it puts your opponent back on the offensive.
      Mix-ups and set-ups are close cousins, so use them intermittently. For example, 
try the same mix-up twice in recent succession. Then, on entering the third mix-up, 
switch it! Some mix-up set-ups only need to be done once for you to switch the level 
of attack!      After a successful volley of mix-up attacks, fall back on a more 
defensive style like her jab or evasion game.

Low moves to consider in mix-up:
-WC d/f+4,4
-WC 3,2
-AOP 3
-AOP 4~3
-RDS d+1
-RDS d/b+4

Mid/high moves to consider in mix-up:
-2+4_1+3
-d/f+2~1
-WS+4
-AOP u+3
-RDS U+4
-RDS 2+4



F3. Set-ups
-----------
      Xiaoyu's set-ups are deadly and morally debilitating to any opponent. A set-up 
is damage through deception. It is her most advanced art, and the most potentially 
damaging. Set-ups can only be used at certain precise times, or after a series of 
carefully planned moves.
      The downside to set-ups is that they are risky. If an opponent can see a set-up 
coming, or just happens to get lucky, Ling will get killed. Another downside is the 
lack of flexibility to this strategy. She can't use most of her set-ups at a moment's 
notice.
      Several moves and methods can be used in a set-up. Baiting, "jump over" 
technique, canceling, even wall teching can be used in set-ups. Having more set-ups 
means more damage.
      As a word of advice: never get caught with the same set-up twice.

Set-ups using baiting: See section on Baiting (G4)

F4. Duckling Picking
--------------------
      Duckling Picking is a jab game that hits low. It's the most frustrating of all 
her strategies to play against, because it is most likely to inflict damage. Smart 
opponents are always hesitant to block low against Ling because of her juggle starters. 
Low strings will have at least one of two effects: 1. Ling's opponent will get hit by 
numerous low attacks, 2. Ling's opponent will start blocking low, leaving them open 
for launchers.
      As with any low it, Xiaoyu's low strings can be parried, however difficult. 
Also, Ling's picking from ducking position (hence "duckling") is slower than from 
neutral. They key to using this strategy is positioning. Being in a place where 
you can actually use the moves for this strategy. Against characters with a fast mid 
move with good range or tracking, use this strategy sparingly. As an easy rule of 
thumb, if your opponent can easily hit you in AOP, don't use this strategy.
      Follow this strategy up with mix-ups, confusion, or jabbing.

Moves to use in Duckling:

-d/b+4
-d/b+2
-WC d/f+4,4
-WC D/F+2
-WC D/F+2,1
-WC+3,2
-WC d/b+3+4
-AOP f+4,4
-AOP u
-RDS d+1_2

Duckling strings:

-WC D/F+2, d+2, WC d/f+4,4
-WC d/f+4,4, d/b+3+4, d+1
-WC d/f+4,4, WC 3,2, d+1
-WC d/f+4, u~d/b+3+4, d+1
-WC d/f+4, u~D/F+2, d+2
-d/b+4, d/b+4



F5. Evasion
-----------
      The hardest of Ling's strategies to use effectively, but well worth the effort. 
Her evasion techniques are the most adaptable in the entire game. Moves that sidestep 
left, sidestep right, move toward the screen, and move away from the screen. She has 
rolls, somersaults, shimmies, and twirls. All of these moves can be used to evade an 
opponent's attack. After a successful evasion, an opponent is open to nearly every 
juggle starter. And more often than not, a series of evasion moves will confuse an 
opponent in to being defensive.
      Unfortunately, not every attack can be evaded. Even the best Xiaoyu player gets 
hit when evading. Sometimes a player can inflict more damage with this strategy than 
receive. Sometimes that isn't the case. If an opponent is taking too much damage away 
from you while evading, switch up the strategy.
      Use this strategy at the end of a few rounds. One should be able to feel what the 
opponent is going to do before trying to evade attacks. If an opponent is jabbing 
frequently, go in to AOP. If an opponent is defensive, SSR to rain dance. If an 
opponent is using power moves that don't track, SSL to hypnotist.
      Even though her evasion moves have been seriously weakened from Tekken Tag, she 
is still able to mount a decent game. 
      Also see evasion baiting (G4c).
	*Added*- I just added SS d+3+4 to this list. It's VERY effective for a sidestep.
In my opinion, it is the best sidestep string she has. Becareful though when using it,
because Ling will sidestep towards the screen... SS accordingly. This trick doesn't 
worktoo well for the regular spinner (3+4) because the computer actually reads this
as SS+4. So stick with the d+3+4 and it's all peaches.

Strings to use in Evasion:

-SSL~b+1+2, SSL~b+1+2
-b+1+2>b+3+4
-SSR~b+3+4
-d+1+2
-b+1+2, f+1+2
-SSL, f+1+2
-SS d+3+4



F6. Confusion
-------------
      Xiaoyu's confusion game is deadly, even against the most experienced players. It 
is the reaction of most opponents to become extremely defensive against an intricate 
Ling, and this strategy capitalizes on that. While attacking in this mode, she should 
only use throws and low moves.
      The greatest flaw in this strategy is, quite ironically, it doesn't work against 
the best and worst of opponents. The worst opponents mash the jab, and so do the best. 
While jabs don't do a terrible amount of damage, they do interrupt momentum.
      To be safe, use this strategy after a few jabs, or right after okizeme. You 
either want to catch someone on defensive or on recovery.
      The art of confusion is to do really fancy moves that aren't used often in order 
to use moves that are really simple (throws, low picks, safe mid/high moves).

Strings to use for confusion:

-b+1+2, SSL+4
-b+1+2, d+1+2, 4~3
-SS+4, WC d/b+3+4, 2+4
-4~3, WC d/b+3+4, d+3

F7. Okizeme
-----------
      Okizeme is the art of hitting someone on the ground, or recovering from being on 
the ground. This isn't a strategy, per se, just something that needs to be used after 
every knockdown. Using this art correctly can open the momentum Xiaoyu needs for another 
set of attacks.
      There is no serious flaw in Okizeme, other than it can only be used when opponent 
is on the recovery. To use okizeme correctly, see how the opponent reacts on the 
ground. Do they stay? Tech roll? Instant rise? Roll? These are among the first 
questions you should ask yourself during a match.
      Positioning Ling after a juggle is also crucial for okizeme. Ending a juggle with 
a X marks the spot (f,f+1+2) will keep an opponent close to you. Good for a safe 
okizeme. Ending a juggle with a reverse kick (RDS f+3) will put an opponent at a 
good distance for dash in mix-ups. With any juggle, know how you will finish it, and 
what okizeme you plan to follow up with it.

Things to try for Okizeme:

-Parry baiting (for example, U_D/F+1 to bait a low rising kick. Parry the kick)
-Jump Over (if an opponent is lying lengthwise to you. RD d+3_u+4 good)
-Sidestep walk (encourages rolling. Use 4~3, or d/f+1 if you are fast enough)
-4~3 (if the move misses, immediately go in to AOP and sweep)
-d/b+4 (fairly safe for an easy hit)
-AOP f+3+4 (if tech roll, this move puts you in RD right behind them)
-d/f+2~1 (hits grounded, chance for more okizeme. A little risky on hills)
-Mix up (if they tech roll, run up and mix up throw_d/f+2~1)
-f,f+3 (good for set-up, but sometimes misses. While near walls)
-1+3 (off of a wall tech. A great set-up for extra hits)
-AOP, 2+4 (if they rise kick, it will whiff, BACK THROW!)
-f,f+3, RD cancel (u/f), XMTS (f,f+1+2)


F7*. The Rundown
----------------
      The Rundown is a tactic that can be used by any character in the game. Actually it
can be used by any character in any fighting game. It is a form of okizeme more often than
not. If Ling knocks a character far away (like RD 3 after a juggle) then the opponent
has a momentary period of weakness while standing up off the ground. This is an opportune
time for Ling to RUN at the opponent and use a simple standing mixup. The basic rule of thumb
is MID, LOW, THROW.

MID- d/f+2~1
LOW- d/b+4
THROW- d/f+2+4

If the opponent ducks, MID
If the opponent stands, LOW
If the opponent hesitates, THROW
      This is the rundown.

      You can come up with your own MID, LOW, THROW... there are several possibilities. But
preferably you want something fast and powerful.



F8. Overview
------------
      The only way to win is to cause damage. Strategies are ways to cause damage. If 
one strategy, or a combination of strategies is not producing adequate damage, then 
use a different strategy.
      Ling is the most versatile character in the game. There are several ways to 
use her. Players use their own combinations of strategies to win. But it is never 
wise to use just one strategy, or to use one strategy for a long period of time. 
Xiaoyu is best when she is moving, she's not a stationary character like Marduk, or 
Kuma. Always move from one strategy to the next, always changing.
      Hit for hit, Ling can not deal damage the way most characters can. To over come 
this, there are several techniques for putting an opponent on the defensive 
(jabbing, confusion, evasion). When an opponent is favoring a fast offensive, don't 
try for the set-up! When an opponent becomes defensive, don't use jabbing!
      "An expert player can be defined by one element: control. Expert players seek 
to control; control themselves, control you, and control the fight. Intermediate 
players simply hope their strategies are the winning ones and do their best to 
ensure that." - The Ultimate Guide to Tekken 3-P.113
      Strategies aren't enough. Using them with correct response and purpose is 
what is needed to win a fight against another expert player. 




F*. XIAOYU TURTLE
#################

      This is a new section. I realized that I completely left out Ling's turtle
game in the previous chapter of this FAQ. So I renamed the previous, and started
this one as F*. Actually, this section is fairly valuable (unlike I previously
thought. Oh well... that's why I add to this thing).


F*1. Blocking
-------------
      Not much to say in this section. Sometimes Ling just has to block.
Sometimes Jin is bitching his 2,1. Sometimes Steve is not letting Ling breathe.
That's when she has to turtle. Weather the storm. You'd be surprised how often
people just get impatient. And Ling has a fairly nice turtle game.
     When fighting superior characters, specifically the Mishimas, turtling is
suggested. Heihachi has super fast priority. Kazuya kills AOP. And Jin is a
whore. Unless facing someone who is REALLY inept at fighting Ling, hit them
a few times, run away (block). Do this until they are pissed off enough to make 
mistakes. This is the value of the turtling system.


F*2. Run away!
--------------
      Ling can run away like no other. Given enough skill, she can back dash
all day long. This will piss the hell out of the other guy (especially if Ling
is winning). Just remember some of these when doing your jab-run away game.

-AOP, jump back, AOP,...
-RD b~n+3+4
-RD u/f~u/b


F*3. The great wall of Ling
---------------------------
      Ling's jabs come out very fast (even if they aren't high priority. They
can't beat Jin's 2,1). However, most of the time Ling can get in a pair
of jabs, which can lead in to other picking attacks. Plus, as long as I am 
on the subject, Ling's great walls (b+1_b+2). These are as good as a reversal.
Well, maybe not as good, but they're ok. You can actually block and block and
block and watch for the opponent's next attack. The great wall can interrupt
them and scare the hell out of them. Things I do after b+1, b+2...
      P.S.  B+2, when blocked, acts alot like D/F+1

-B+1, b+1
-b+1, RD 2
-b+1, RD f+3


F*4. Retaliation
----------------
      Turtling would be ABSOLUTELY FRICKING USELESS if it wasn't for
retaliation. Ling has to retaliate blocked or whiffed moves. However,
this is the responsibility of the PLAYER, not the character. So 
whoever is reading this has to know what the hell they are doing.
Moves that are great for retaliation:

-f+3
: Use it for fast retaliation. It is guaruanteed where most other
moves aren't. Great for shifting momentum
*f+3 has greater range, but if you can get away with it, use 3 instead

-d/f+2~1
: Ling won't land this alot against experienced players. They'll
be smart enough to use moves that don't take up that much recovery.
But hey, it's there.

-d+4
: If you have the TINIEST window, use this move. Great for pissing the 
other guy off. Great for tacking on some extra damage. Just be sure
the other guy doesn't know it is coming.

-1, D+2
: IF YOU HAVE THE ABSOLUTE BARE MINIMUM TIME TO GET IN SOME DAMAGE,
use this.



G. TACTICS REGARDING GAMEPLAY
#############################


G1. Momentum
------------
      Momentum is the force of control throughout a fight. At the beginning of a fight, 
both players start at neutral momentum. If someone lands a hit, or a series of hits, 
they are likely to gain momentum.
      Xiaoyu is a momentum character. When she has control, there is no limit to how 
much damage she can do. While she is in control, the opponent is more concerned about 
retrieving momentum, rather than inflicting damage. If Ling can keep the momentum, 
the opponent will never hit her! I have seen matches where she has been beaten within 
an inch of her life, then come back on one surge of momentum to win a match.
      Gaining momentum can be as easy as connecting a pair of jabs. After a pair of 
jabs, nothing is guaranteed. But, it does give Ling frame advantage, perfect for 
using a 12-16 frame move such as the offensive shove (d/b+3). The offensive shove 
is unblockable, low, and gives momentum. After an offensive shove produces more 
frame advantage, enough for a X marks the spot (f,f+1+2). Which when blocked 
causes a guard stun. Ling has just used 3 moves with little or no threat of retaliation.
      Momentum can also be gained off of a juggle. After a set-up juggle, and a few 
points of damage, okizeme keeps the opponent from regaining momentum. Momentum 
can be gained off of any downed opponent. Throws, knock down hits, and even launchers 
that don't guarantee juggles (AOP 3+4). A simple advantage of a few frames can turn 
the flow of momentum in a fight.
      Keeping momentum is easy if the correct moves are used. Don't use moves that 
push away, or moves that have a substantial lag. The easiest way to lose momentum is 
the opponent getting off a few jabs. Even if the jabs are blocked, it puts each 
character back a neutral momentum. To get around this, sidestep or crouch punch 
before they have a chance. The reverse crouch punch (RD d+1) is the perfect move 
for keeping up momentum. It almost always hits, and can go directly in to duckling 
picking.
      If momentum is lost, preferably lose it to a neutral position. It is better for 
Ling if she is hit by a pair of jabs rather than a Yoshi uppercut. Don't fret over a 
connected crouch punch or a pair of jabs, because it's much better than a juggle 
launcher. Keep the jab game up and you should be safe from juggles. Neutral momentum 
isn't a horrible place for Ling to be.
      Losing all momentum can be a real pain. Depending on the character, you can 
suffer real damage. Versus Law, Hwoarang, or Lei, stay on the ground and there is no 
chance of losing momentum. Against other characters who have moves that take serious 
damage away from an opponent, be cautious. An extended tech roll to a roll back is 
most often wise.
      In any matter, the name of the game is control. Momentum is about controlling 
your opponent. Control your opponent, keep the momentum, and the game is yours.



G2. Mind Games
--------
      Mind games are played on a completely different dimension from what is on the 
screen. It is a battle of thinking and strategy. Forcing another mind to become 
unsure, brash, or afraid causes it to make mistakes. Mistakes are something that 
Xiaoyu can take advantage of.
      In any video game, commands are sent from the mind, to the hands, through the 
computer, to the character. The character does not do the thinking, the character 
has their own properties and weaknesses to take advantage of. The computer is 
something that can be used to Ling's advantage (levels, glitches, the clock). The 
hands are their own entity. Your opponent's dexterity is not something that you 
can control. The mind, along with the computer and character, is something that 
you can control.
      To make an opponent unsure is a great way to kill their offense. Law has his 
parry counters, which can take away an opponent's confidence in attack. Jin has his 
parry, which can be followed up by an attack. Even reversals can be used to shake 
confidence. Xiaoyu isn't a defensive character, but her evasion properties can work 
like defense. If she can evade certain attacks consistently, the opponent backs off 
to regroup. Even consistently parrying a pair of jabs is enough to make an opponent 
not use them!
      Fear games force an opponent to do something that is wrong. Paul, for example, 
has a built in fear game. Everybody fears the Deathfist, so it isn't often that 
someone blocks low against Paul. This is why his SS+3 works so often. Ling doesn't 
have any built in fear games, so she has to make them. Her fear games are essentially 
her mix-ups. One that I use is a d+1+2~4~3 several times, and then use a d+1+2~1+2. 
Fear games are best used when pressuring at range 0-1. Giving the opponent no time 
to react is a great way to make them afraid of attack.
      Making an opponent break his cool is the essential theme of mind games. 
Taunting an opponent in to attack is a brilliant mind game. Taunts are a direct 
challenge to an opponent. Rain dance taunts are even more insulting. If the 
opponent losses their cool, then their concentration is thrown off. If a 
taunt bait like this works, their concentration for the rest of the match 
could be seriously impaired. 
      Mind games are an advanced art, and shouldn't be fully relied upon. Against 
experienced players, mind games are almost useless. Stick to the basic strategies 
and tactics, and use this when you know exactly how the opponent thinks.



G3. The Clock
-------------
      The turtle's greatest weapon. Unfortunately, time may not always be on your 
side. The following tactics should be used within the last 15 game seconds of a 
match, when the chance of an "out of time" is likely. Using these tactics throughout 
an entire match for the purpose of a time-out win is likely to get Ling killed.
      When the clock hits 15 seconds the FIRST thing that needs to be seen is the 
lifespan. Who's winning and by how much? The answer to those questions determine 
the following series of actions.
      Xiaoyu is winning by a large margin: she has some options in this scenario. 
The opponent is forced to charge in to her with whatever attack that may cause the 
most damage. Ling has the option of staying on the ground against weak ground 
characters. She also has the option of turtling back and sticking with 1,2 jabs 
whenever the opponent gets near. Whatever happens, never just block. Use quick 
moves that aren't likely to get you in trouble. Keep in mind that the opponent will 
try juggles, and try to hit you on a counter hit whenever possible.
      Xiaoyu is winning or losing by a small margin: forget the clock all together. 
Use the same strategies that have been used throughout the entire match. If the clock 
manages to wind down to 3-4 seconds and she is still in the lead, jab and turtle. 
If she is barely behind, don't lose your focus and continue playing. Look for any 
momentum there is to be had.Xiaoyu is losing by a large margin: Not many options. 
If the clock runs out, she's dead. If she is defensive, she's dead. If she does weak 
damage, she's dead. The only chance she has at victory is a large chunk of damage. 
Use whatever set-up she has involving juggles. The moves like the california roll 
and the reverse hop kick may provide the damage and momentum needed for a come back. 
This scenario is the time for set-ups, whether they work or not.
      The goal in any fighting game is to inflict damage. Clock or no clock, damage 
must be inflicted in order to win. But depending on the situation, Xiaoyu should 
take different course of actions. Jab if ahead, set-up if behind.



G4. Baiting
-----------
      Also known as feigning weakness. Xiaoyu is the best character in the game at 
feigning weakness because she fights like a school girl! Baiting, in other words, 
is pretending to be vulnerable in a situation. The opponent attacks, expecting an 
easy hit. Ling counters for damage. Even the smartest players sometimes get fooled 
by this tactic. Feigning weakness can be used in every strategy. Baiting jump over 
tactics can be used in okizeme, evasion baiting in her sidestep game, and recovery 
baiting in her jab game.
      The purpose of baiting is to entice the opponent to attack. The following 
sections are different methods to accomplish that goal, and follow up with 
devastating consequences.


G4a. Shadow Baiting
      This tactic is only used in strings. Difficult, but not impossible, to use 
in custom strings. The method is to do an incomplete string. Such as the double fan 
to hydragea to fortune cookie. Leaving off the fortune cookie a few times, then 
using it. The opponent sees the same attack a few times, and is then baited in to 
eating the fortune cookie. Ling doesn't have many strings that she can use for shadow 
baiting, but they do exist. It is best if each baiting move is safe, with or without 
using it. Any character with strings has this capability, so keep on the lookout.
      Using strings in shadow baiting, both the last hit and the second to the last 
hit have to be safe.

Examples of Shadow Baiting:

-u+1+2,2, _1
-u+1+2, 3+4_2
-f,f+2, _1
-1,2, _1
-1, d+2, _1+2
-u+41.2.(1+2).1.3, _RDS 4
-WC+3,2,1, _4*
-RDS 2,1 _4*
-AOP u+3, _4
*Risky

Examples of Shadow Baiting in Custom strings:

-1,2 (hit), d/b+3, _d/b+1
-1,2 (hit), d/b+3, _1+2


G4b. Delay Baiting
      Using moves with a delay. An opponent sees a move cut short, and thinks to 
attack. This can be used in junction with Shadow baiting to make the feign more 
convincing. Strings that end poorly at the second to last hit (that can be delayed) 
should only be used in delay baiting. The right handful to fortune cookie (AOP 2>1) 
is one such example.
      Timing for delay baiting is crucial. To early and the move will be blocked. 
To late and the opponent's attack will get through. To learn the timing takes 
competition. There is no other way. 
My rule of thumb is two moments before the last possible chance to input the move.
      Delay baiting in custom strings is much easier to explain. Use a safe 
custom string a few times in a match. Then on the third or fourth time, put a 
delay on the last hit.

Examples of Delay Baiting:

-u+1+2,2>1
-f,f+2>1
-1,2>1
-AOP 2>1


Examples of Delay Baiting in Custom Strings:

d/f+1>f+3
WC d/f+4,4>d+1+2~3+4
d/b+2, WC 4>WS+4


G4c. Evasion Baiting
      This type of baiting is great against people who love to jab. It involves using 
a 7-8 frame recovery hit at close range, evading, then striking when an opponent's 
attack misses. Best for use at close range where an opponent is more likely to attack.

Evasion bait:

-1,2
-1,d+2
-1,D+2
-2,1
-3
-u+4
-u/f+3~d+1+2
-u+1+2
-RDS 2
-RDS f,f+3
-RDS 3
-AOP 2
-Taunt
-Hypnotist walk
-SS walk

Evading moves:

-d+1+2
-f+1+2
-b+3+4
-D (SS walk)
-WC d/b+3+4
-d+3+4_3+4
-RDS b~3+4
-RDS 3+4
-AOP 2+4



Gfd. Taunt Baiting
      Use this only if you are facing an opponent who has lost his concentration. A 
taunt will bait an opponent to come in for an attack. When this happens, Ling cancels 
the taunt and puts in some damage.
      The best position to taunt bait from is rain dance. She has the capability to 
taunt in rain dance, an extremely vulnerable stance. From here, she has many options. 
If the opponent is smart, they will dash in to bait an attack on Ling's part. Don't 
be so fooled. The california roll will give you the range and opportunity to seriously 
mess with any opponents strategy. If the opponent is definitely coming in for the 
attack, RDS f+3_u/f+4 works well too. From neutral taunt baiting, a pair of jabs works 
safest.



G4e. Parry Baiting
      A wonderful little trick that can be used by every character in the game. Ling 
has a 16+ frame advantage if she manages to parry a low move. By quickly inputting 
(d/f) during an opponents low (or special mid) attack, their punch or kick will be 
thrown to the side. After a low thrust block, Xiaoyu can juggle the opponent with 
cross lifting palms (d/f+2~1).
      Parry baiting is specifically using a move (or combination of moves) to tempt 
a predictable crouch punch or sweep. Usually the fastest move the opponent will have 
that hits ducking opponents is a crouch punch. However, characters like Steve, 
Heihachi, or Paul may opt to use a fast mid move. As a suggestion, use a move. 
If the opponent crouch punches, wait a few volleys. Then try the move again and 
bait the parry.

Moves that Incite low punches:

-4~3
-u/f+4
-U/F,n+4
-f,f+1+2


G4f. Counter Hit Baiting
      Xiaoyu has a few moves that if connected on a counter hit will cause serious 
damage. Baiting a counter hit is risky, but the damage is great. The timing needs to 
be perfect, otherwise Ling may be the one that is counter hit. Develop a few counter 
hit baiting scenarios. They are most useful when Ling is losing by a large margin, 
and needs one huge surge of momentum and damage. 
      There are methods to counter hit baiting that relate to all other types of 
baiting. CH on a taunt, on a delay, on recovery, even on a parry. Even idle play is 
a counter hit bait. Even though it is deadly for Ling to stand still, there are 
people who bait counter hits just by standing still.

Moves that have Counter Hit Properties:

-4~3
-SS+4
-u+4
-f,f+2,1
-d/b+4
-WS+2
-RDS 1
-RDS d+3
-AOP 2,1
-AOP 3+4

Examples:

-1,D+2, d/b+4
-d/b+2, d/b+2, u/f+4
-RDS 2+3+4, RDS 1
-WC d/f+4, ... AOP 2,1
-d/f+2 (hit), f,f+2,1
-WC d/f+4,4, f~f~d/b+4

G4g. Recovery Baiting
      It is a fairly common belief that Ling's moves have poor recovery. This is a 
common belief that every Ling player can take advantage of. Some of Ling's moves 
only seem to have poor recovery. Using moves that have poor recovery, and using a 
fast power move or jab just afterwards is the basis of recover baiting. Blocked or 
not, these moves are deadly. Recovery bait usually ends in rain dance where Ling 
can take advantage of her fast power strikes.

Moves that are Deceptively Fast Recovering:

-u+1
-RDS 3
-RDS f,f+3
-RDS 2

G4h. Oddity Baiting
	There really isn't a word for this next idea of baiting. It goes something
like this. The player's character knocks the opponent's character off axis. Like
Steve's d/f+1,2,1 or Hwoarang's LFL b+3. The opponent does something that would
normally be expected, but fails, which leaves them open for attack.
	My favorite example would be Hwoarang's string, 2,3,b+3... the opponents,
not realizing his situation, punches. When the opponent punches, the computer 
mistakes it for a BT 1 and turns him in an odd direction. Tada, free throw.
	Ling doesn't really have any of these, but I thought I'd put them in here
for future knowledge. There is one that she has that I'm working on... a neat
little set-up. If you manage to get it during play, major props.

-2+4, 2+3+4
:The opponent has the option of doing a get-up kick. If he does this, low or mid,
he'll get nailed by the 2+3+4. An viola! Free launcher.

G4i. Rising Kick Bait
        This is an interesting setup that I don't use that often. This setup is
used strictly against a grounded opponent in an effort to bait the rising kick
(grounded 4 or grounded 3). It is different from parry baiting in that you
can use this setup against a grounded 4 and not just a grounded 3. I'll give
you a few examples.

*NOTE* all of the following setups are performed against a grounded opponent

-RD 3 < RD 4
: One of the few uses for the kickout sommersault. The RD 3 starts out real
slow and gives the opponent plenty of time to think "GEE, THIS IS A GOOD TIME
FOR A RISING KICK". Unforuntately for the opponent, the RD 3 ends with ALOT
of spacing and more often than not their rising kick will miss. Leaving
them WIDE OPEN for an RD 4.

-AOP U/B, D+1+2 (AOP)
: Going in to AOP next to a grounded opponent just begs for a rising kick. But
timing is super-critical here. AS SOON AS LING GOES IN TO AOP SHE MUST JUMP BACK.
It takes a little bit of time for Ling to get out of the range of a rising kick.
Spacing is important too. Too far and she jumps back too far to punish the opponent.
Too close and she gets hit by the rising kick. If all goes smoothly, Ling jumps back
in to another AOP while the opponent is still recovering from a rising kick.
Bon apetite!



H. DETAILED TACTICS AND ANALYSIS
################################


H1. Walls
---------
      The new dimension in Tekken is the advent of walls. And not just rectangular, 
symmetrical, straight cornered walls either. There is an amount of strategy involved 
in using them, as well as a bit of cheese. This section includes a few helpful hints 
when using Ling near a wall. Unfortunately for some, it is impossible to stay away 
from the walls 100% of the time. Learning to use the walls instead of avoiding them 
is a fast way to improve at T4.
      Wall push (1+3~u_d_b_f). One of Ling's [1] break "throws". When pushed in to 
a wall the opponent will be stunned long enough for other moves to be guaranteed. 
Unfortunately, Ling doesn't have killer wall push combos (normally). Putting an 
opponent on the ropes is great for mind games and momentum, even if it isn't the 
most damaging. She'll only be able to input a few jabs, or another throw if she's 
daring. One string that I like is 1+3, 1, D+2. This string gives her ample 
opportunity to see how the opponent is going to react, and re-react accordingly.
      When around walls, always think how to use them. It is best if Ling can manage 
to be facing a wall, rather than facing away from it. Because of her sidestep game, 
she's able to do this with relative use. Using throw setups with a 1+3 has it's 
advantages, as well as using power moves with a (w!) property. For example, when an 
opponent is in a corner a bayonet to fortune cookie (1,2,1) will hit if the opponent 
gets scared.
      Fighting with Ling's back to the wall stinks. Especially when she is in a corner. 
Her sidestep game is limited to the point of absurdity. An opponent can jab (and 
will jab) continuously until she is dead. Getting out from a wall she needs to evade 
an attack. A cartwheel does the trick for me. A few jabs to push them away, then an 
SSL to cartwheel. Even if she is hit by the opponent's jabs, she'll be out from the 
wall. If that doesn't work, just wait for an opportunity to present itself. Jab back 
until that window appears.
      Ling's power around walls is all in the mind. People get antsy when cornered. 
They lose focus! Perfect for her to take advantage of. Use jabs and duckling 
picking until you are in a position to use her close range mix-ups. Extremely deadly 
against slower opponents. If they manage to sidestep around her for an instant, throw 
them back with a 1+3. Keep them against the wall as long as possible.
      With an opponent parallel to the wall is a good position for Ling to be in. She 
can out sidestep most characters, and she can be faster. The goal when fighting 
parallel to the wall is either to take the match back out in to the open, or force 
the opponent in to a corner. Either way, she needs to pitbull in this instance. 
Forcing the opponent back will eventually put them in a corner! Use moves that can 
push them like (d/b+1), (1,D+2), (D/F+1), etc. Using sidesteps is a tactic more likely 
to put both characters back in the open.

H2. Ranges
----------
      Ranges play an important role in tactics. Obviously, no one would try to throw at 
range three and no one would try a step kick (f,f+4) at range 0. Ling can use different 
tactics and strategies, even at different ranges. She does her best work at range 0-1. 
By nature, she is a pitbull. In Tekken 4, with the addition of new moves and different 
timing, she can also work well at range 2-3. Her worst area of play is range 1-2. This 
section is focusing on each range and what tactics should be used. (Note that all of 
these tactics are applied only to neutral fighting).
      Definition of ranges. Range 0 is considered throw range. Range 1 is from the 
end of throw range to the tip of a jab. Range 2 starts at the tip of a jab to the tip 
of power strikes (d/b+1 in this case). Range 3 is the tip of power strikes all the way 
to the end of the screen.
      Range 0 is a wonderful place to be. An opponent's jab shield can make it hard at 
times to get near, but it's exactly where to be. Ling's fast mix-ups, throw set-ups, 
and jabs work best at this range. Range 0 is meant for pressuring. If Xiaoyu can out-jab 
the opponent, she should. Since her sidestep has been reduced greatly, it's not a great 
idea to use an evasion game at this distance (evasion baiting is still ok).
      Range 1 is where Ling ends up after most of her attacks. This range is too close 
for power attacks, and a little bit too far for mix-ups. Spend time in this range 
working back in to range 0. She can sidestep fairly well in this range, so keep that 
in mind. The primary thing to do in this range is a simple 1,2 jab. She has good 
follow-up and it puts her in closer. She can also use safe strings to put her closer 
(1,2,1) (2,1) (D/F+1).
      Range 2 is a bit tricky for Ling. None of her power moves are that abusable, 
not even the storming flower (d/b+1). The beginning of range 2 is perfect for 
sidestepping. However, if her sidestep game isn't up to par... use a long sweeping 
string like (2,1). The middle of range two is her best place for power hits. The 
storming flower has a tendency of being over-estimated range-wise, and the birds flock 
(1+2) will get beat by jabs. The end of range 2 should be used sidestep walks and 
medium range moves like the demon flip (4~3), pirouette kick (u/f+3), and raccoon 
swing (f,f+3). This quasi-range is best for Ling other than range 0 because of all 
her distance moves.
      Range 3 isn't horrible for Ling like it has been in the past. She can use most 
of her distance set-ups in this range (RDS f+3+4, AOP f+3+4). Her demon flip is still 
ok, even if it doesn't hit (go in to AOP). Use her long distance moves from this 
range ... step kick, forward layout, hop n throw. The end of Range 3 is running ground. 
If Ling can get a run going before the opponent, she has first dibs at a shoulder 
charge. This range is not where anyone wants to be in Tekken 4, especially people 
who love to jab. This is the range where Ling has an advantage over most characters. 
Take the time and space to side-step walk and be patient.
      In general, Range 0-1-2 is the place to gain momentum while range 2-3 is the place 
to keep from getting damaged. It's a pitbull versus turtle strategy. Against the best 
players, it is much better to stay close. While close in, Ling must always attack. 
While far away, Ling must always be patient. If she gets too intent on attacking 
while in range 3 she'll get killed by CH happy opponents. If she stands still at 
range 1, she'll lose momentum.



H3. Levels
----------

H3a. Underground
      A horrible stage for some, great for others. A small, enclosed arena with 4 
corners and vision blackouts caused by opaque onlookers. Use the walls to your 
advantage because it's absolutely impossible to stay away from them in this stage. 
Ling's range 3 game is limited in this stage, so stay in range 0-1. If she can get 
away with it, stay with the jabs and duckling game. This puts a ton of pressure on any 
opponent, especially on this stage.
      There are some serious problems for Ling when fighting on this stage. Whenever 
some of the bystanders block the view, use a safe jab string until both characters 
can be seen again. Against a Paul or Heihachi player, don't get knocked down in a 
corner. Their hammer fists (d+1) can hit Ling all day long with no retaliation. 
Sidestepping is a bit harder, but not impossible. So long as Ling doesn't try to 
sidestep in to a wall, she's fine. The final serious problem is the infinite combo. 
Because the walls are so close together, a simple juggle with RDS 2,2,2,2,... can 
become infinite.
	

H3b. Beach
      A wide-open stage with a few unexpected walls and changing floor surfaces. This 
stage gives Ling the option of her sidestep games and her range 3 fighting. Wall 
fighting won't be common on this stage, but it does happen. There are only two corners 
to worry about on this stage (the concrete walls, and the concrete wall-chain link 
fence). Keep in mind their location and stay away from them. If possible, memorize 
the location of the beach shack and palm tree. The water provides an excellent "masking" 
effect for Ling's duckling game. The water can completely conceal moves like WC d/f+4. 
Use Ling how she would normally be used, except around walls.


H3c. Arena
      The tournament stage of choice. No uneven surfaces, no right-angled corners, 
a fair amount of walls, and a good sized open fighting area in the middle. All of 
Ling's games can be used on this stage, as with most characters. Stay in range 0-1 
near the walls, and range 0-1,3 while in open territory. Infinite combos are a danger 
on this level, but they are far less common than on Underground. Because of the obtuse 
corners, the hammer fist trap is easier to avoid (but still be aware of it).


H3d. Shinjuku
      A closed in area with some uneven surfaces and walls everywhere. More often than 
not two opponent's will be facing each other parallel to a wall here. Be careful with 
okizeme here, the uneven surfaces (curbs) might cause a whiff. If Ling is fighting a 
character that is better around walls, use the sidestep game to get away from the wall. 
There are a few corners to worry about on this level. Near the shops and stores there 
are nooks that can be troublesome. The glass booths in the middle of the area can be 
used for  a peek-a-boo hit (attacking through the ruble).


H3e. Hon-Maru
      A well-made stage in my opinion. A large rectangular wooden arena with no uneven 
surfaces. The area in the center is just wide enough to suit a range 3 game. 
Fortunately, the stage is large enough to allow avoidance of corners. However, 
there is basically nothing on this level to take advantage of. Exactly why most 
people want to play on it.


H3f. Jungle
      One of the hardest levels to play on other than Underground. Uneven surfaces, 
jagged walls, uneven surfaces, corners, and water to boot. There level is a large 
pentagon with a tree in the middle, so keep in mind there are 5 corners (plus the 
roots of the tree). One half of the pentagon is lowland, filled with water. The other 
half is highland with corners everywhere. Fight on the water if possible, fight going 
downhill if possible. Stay away from the walls on the highland, it is a death 
sentence to anyone to be caught in a corner.


H3g. Parking Garage
      The Parking Garage is a wonderful closed in level. There are a few corners and 
alleys to worry about, but nothing impossible. Range 3 game is nearly impossible, and 
the sidestep game is limited near the walls. It is necessary to use the walls on this 
level, it is not large enough to avoid completely. The pillars are good for a peek-a-boo 
hit. The corners are near the cars, and the alleys are between the pillars and the wall.


H3h. Mall
      A huge stage with many walls, pillars, and surfaces. People tend to roam much 
farther on this level than other big levels, so practicing with every part of this 
level is key. It is common for a fight to start near the four pillars and end near 
the stairs. The only uneven surfaces that need worrying about are the stairs. Walls 
are plentiful, but they can be avoided. The rails on the stairs opposite the pillars 
are breakable, but they can be used for at least one wall hit. Because the walls on 
this level are short, often times the defensive fighter will have their back to a 
wall. Ling is on offensive character, so keep this in mind.


H3i. Statue
      More pillars than any other stage. More breakable objects than any other stage. 
This stage is where I use most of my peek-a-boo attacks (hit an object and attack 
through the ruble). Okizeme is a bit harder to use on this stage, as well as range 3 
tactics. Walls and surfaces are everywhere and impossible to avoid. The stairs on both 
sides of the statue can cause some weird effects in juggles and hits, but not as bad 
as the Jungle. Another danger in this stage are the abundance of corners. Not a great 
stage to face Heihachi or Paul.


H3j. Rooftop
      The incline stage. Most of the level is one giant incline where juggles and 
okizeme can suffer. Breakable statues all along the sides of the stage serve as 
temporary corners and walls. A few corners to worry about at the "upper" part of 
the stage, but they are fairly easy to see coming. The stage is open enough to a range 3 
game,  but because of the incline it's better to stay closer.


H3k. Airport
      If Tekken Tag is still the favorite game, this is the level in T4. A huge, level 
expanse with few walls or breakable objects. Nothing to take advantage of, except 
the large space. Range 3 game is ideal on this stage. Most of the set-ups used in 
Tekken Tag can still work in this level. This is the level to take on a super wall 
character like Paul or Jin. This level puts the emphasis on strategy on not cheese, 
which is absolutely perfect for Ling.


H3l. Lab
      The most closed in stage outside of Underground. The mist on the ground can 
mask Ling's duckling game, so abuse it more on this level. Walls are abundant and 
impossible to avoid. Corner encounters are abundant, so be careful. This is a stage 
for range 1 fighting, pitbull and push the opponent back to a corner in order to 
win. There are inclines on both sides of the stage, but they don't nearly screw things 
up as Rooftop, Jungle, or Statue.



H4. Characters
--------------


H4a. Kuma
      Kuma is not as weak or slow as people might believe, so be careful. The best Kuma 
players won't try to out set-up, out jab, or out-pitbull. But one thing that Kuma 
does fairly well is turtle. The moves to worry about are the infamous bear jab (f+1), 
the demon upper cut (f,f+2), and the salmon hunter (b,f+2+4). There is also some 
hunting bear mix-up that should be feared, and I will cover that too. The bear jab can 
be a nasty thing to face. Extremely fast, killer priority, and long range. This move 
is used for interrupting momentum rather than causing damage. Blocking a bear jab will 
put Ling at a decent range from Kuma. Unfortunately, Kuma can also be fairly good at 
Range 3. Also his g-clef cannon (f+1,1,1) on a counter-hit is guaranteed. Don't try 
to out-jab Kuma for this reason. The demon uppercut (f,f+2) is another reason why 
Ling shouldn't jab Kuma. The demon uppercut will go under most jabs (even 1,d+2) and 
cause serious damage, especially when paired with the JF salmon hunter. One of the 
most hated moves in all of Tekken, the JF salmon hunter. Fast, low, A TON of damage, 
and UNBLOCKABLE. Off of a demon uppercut, it's guaranteed to hit.
      The other thing to fear from a Kuma player is the Hunting Bear. The mix-up 
comes from the bear fling (HB 1+2)_bear toss (HB f+1+2)_Bear sweep (HB 2). One hits 
high, one hits mid, and one hits low. They all execute safely, and are safe on 
recovery if blocked. The bear fling (mid) is a great juggle starter and will do a ton 
of damage. The bear toss is a throw (1+2 escape), fair damage. And the bear sweep is 
low, safe ifblocked. The one flaw in each of these moves is the lag time in execution. 
A simple duckling string might do the trick. But don't underestimate Kuma in 
this stance, he moves much easier than he did in TTT.
      All in all, Kuma is not a top tier character. He can be used in a worst case 
scenario as cheese, but it isn't considered polite. Ling does have some trouble 
against a good Kuma because of all the damage that she takes. The way to beat a 
good Kuma is a sidestep, duckling, set-up game. Don't try to pressure Kuma with 
jabs, cause Ling will get killed. Sidestepping is possible, but be careful. The 
demon uppercut can track fairly well at a distance. Use AOP in this fight, but don't 
flinch or stay in it too long. Rain dance is risky, so only use it in set-ups. 
Hypnotist tactics can be effective at a close range. Overall, play it safe. Make the 
opponent angry by turtling right back at them. Take of little chunks in the 
beginning to put Ling in a slight lead, then wait for the Kuma player to get 
antsy and make mistakes.
      *Gawd Damn! Watch out for Sugarfoot's Kuma... an up and comer...


H4b. Hwoarang
      This character has been seriously modified from Tekken Tag. His sidestep game has 
been toned down, but his flamingo stance has been given extra power. The flamingo 
stance has been modified so that now nearly any move can transfer in to any other 
move, custom string heaven. Hwoarang is a character who relies on set-ups and custom 
combos. His mix-ups aren't as good as a character like Ling simply because they leave 
Hwoarang extremely open if blocked.
      Set-ups won't do that much damage if they can be anticipated. The set-up that 
does the most harm is RFL (Right Flamingo) 4. On a CH, a dynamite heel is guaranteed. 
One set-up I've seen for this move was RFF d/f+4~f, RFL 4. Another is d+3,4, RFL 4 on 
a grounded opponent. Set-ups can also come from OSB (side turned when blocked) moves 
and guard breaks. For example, LFL b+3 causes an OSB. If the opponent tries to  punch 
it will actually be read by the computer as BT 1_2, and it will miss! Leaving a free 
side throw for Hwoarang. The RFF 3~4 also works very well as a OSB move.
      The custom strings are Hwoarang's greatest weapon. Unless they are parried, 
reversed, or sidestepped, a good Hwoarang player can pick away at Ling the entire 
match. Use Ling's sidesteps to avoid most of Hwoarang's attacks. Fortunately, if 
Hwoarang wants to do any damage, he will have to take risks.
      Back in TTT, Hwoarang was the movement king. He could sidestep, fake, twirl, 
glitch, the whole nine yards. In T4 it's been toned down, but he still can move. One 
movement that I watch out for is the Fox step. It looks as though Hwoarang is dashing 
or running in the wrong direction. It takes a fair amount of time to pull off, but it's 
really enthralling when it happens. Crouch punch on reaction. If anyone wonders about the 
notation, it is BT LFF 3+[4]~3+[4]. There are some fast ways to get in to it, but don't 
worry about it. Most people can go a lifetime and never see it in a match. It's more of 
a status symbol than a move. I do use it as a throw set-up... 
b+3+4~b, 1+2~3+[4],3+[4]~b~b>2+4... and it can be used for feigning weakness (in the 
other direction)... 1+2, [4], u/f, 3+[4], ff, pause,  BT 3. But again, no one will 
see this within their lifetime.
	Hwoarang has a deceivingly good wall game, but it requires that you turtle. He
has plenty of moves that can lead back in to another wall push. 1,2,3,1...1,2,3,2,d+1,
...1,2,d/f+1... watch for the high moves.
	Most of Hwoarang's best moves come from high. It's very hard for a Hwoarang
player to completely rely on mid moves. That's why most people duck against him.
Most of the match he'll be picking Ling with moves to try and get her to stand.
STAY LOW. Aside from the b+3 (and I think d+4,4), there's nothing that is a real
threat to Ling in AOP. Try droping in to AOP really fast and doing a move.
      Beating Hwoarang with Ling isn't impossible. With Ranges, Hwoarang is best at 
Range 1-2. Ling can out jab him in range 1, but can't do much in range 2. So either 
stay in very close and use jabs, or stay back and use long range moves. At close 
range when in pitbull mode, watch out for the Sky Rocket (f,n,d/f+4) because it can 
duck 1,2 punches. Personally I like the Belly Chop against this kind of character 
(few mid moves are faster). Against an intermediate Hwoarang, pitbull and keep at 
it. Against an expert Hwoarang player, pitbull except when facing flamingo... then 
try range 3 or sidestep. Another weakness that Hwoarang has is the lack of a wall 
game or good okizeme.
      *I should tell you all, my Ling sucks against Hwoarang. But my Law can beat
Bob's ass!!!

		
H4c. Yoshimitsu
      Yoshi's strength still lies in his unblockables, but thanks to T4's jab abusers, 
he has been given new strength. His kangaroo kick (4~3) can go under jabs, as well 
as his new samurai knee (u/f+3). In the hands of an expert, Yoshi can actually be as 
fluid as Ling. He's actually a very good character, just not in the hands of a beginner 
or intermediate player.
      The unblockables can be a problem sometimes. Yoshi can hit every level with his 
unblockables (high, mid, low). The bad breath (d/b+1+2~1) hits high can lead to extra 
juggle damage. The Sweep Slice (WC d/b, b+1) hits low, but takes a fair amount of time 
for button command and execution. The sword shield (b,b+1~1) is a great mid move at 
close range, but slow on execution. Yoshi's death copter (u/f+1+2>1) is good at a 
distance or for Okizeme. The trick to beating Yoshi's unblockables? Pitbull like a 
madman...madling.
      Goodness knows beating Yoshi isn't that easy. Yoshi has several moves that can 
drop under a pair of jabs and cause serious damage (d/b+1+2~1, u/f+3, 4~3). So 
completely relying on a pitbull strategy can be bad. Fortunately, Ling can avoid 
Yoshi's fast high unblockables and pitbull at the same time. Duckling can take care 
of Yoshi fairly effectively.
      Yoshi does have the ability to set-up... the main one to look out for is after 
a wall push (1+3~f, f+2, 2+4) *back throw sickness*. The other thing to watch out for 
is the crouch mix-up. Yoshi doesn't have great mix-ups in neutral or any other stance 
except crouching. From there he can mix the sweep slice, the full sweep, and the 
samurai knee. Yoshi can get in close with the first part of the woodcutter (d/f+3) 
to a crouch punch... then mix up the three moves. The way to beat it? Crouch punch 
faster than he can hit you. The other mix-up is off of a manji spin punch (b+1) to a 
throw_samurai knee. Just break the throw and Ling is safe.
      He can be cheesy if the opponent knows how. The door knocker (d/f+1,1,1,1) is a 
safe string that can be repeated over and over. Ling can either thrust block or 
crouch punch at the end of the string to end it. That takes care of the Yoshi scrubs 
out there.
      Even though Yoshi has certain advantages over most characters, he is still 
middle tier. His lack of an effective jab string seriously limits him. And for most 
players, he is hard to handle. Going in to a match versus Jin or Paul (brickhouses), 
Yoshi can be a shaky match. Against Ling, he's toast. Just as long as no one 
forgets what makes Yoshi a strong character.
      *Wall push, b,b+1,1... as a matter of fact, always watch the b,b+1+1
      *d/f+1,1,1,1 is abusable if you don't know how to stop it. Duck the second
and third hits and crouch punch the fourth.
		
H4d. Julia
      Julia is the epitome of safe. Most of her moves revolve around safe or well 
calculated attacks. Her CH offense is the best in the game, so pitbulls tend to have 
a bit of trouble. Ling has a hard time against Julia because she is a pitbull, and for 
the fact that her lifebar is so short. One G-clef cannon on a counter hit and Ling is 
fated for death. This is the character that won the T4 national tournament, so don't 
underestimate her!
      The counter hit offense is simple: bait the opponent in to attacking in to a CH. 
Julia accomplishes this by several moves that recover deceivingly well. The elbow set-up 
is most common (f,f+2 1~1,1,1). Turtle just a tad more at range 1 for this reason, or 
crouch punch. A sidestep game might also take away some of Julia's CH offense, so 
keep the hypnotist dance in mind.
      Julia's elbow is the second most accursed move in the game (next to the deathfist). 
It's fast, fast recovering, high priority, and  impervious to retaliation. The worst 
part, it guarantees range 0-1-2 as Julia territory. Don't face the elbow head on, it's 
certain death for Ling. Instead fight in range three, or a fast duckling series.
	Low parry!!!! Some of Julia's custom strings are fantastic. For example,
WS 2,1,3 is completely safe if no one parries it! Many people (who actually know 
what they're doing with Julia), will stop at that low kick from the bow and arrow,
which leaves them at a fairly good position.
      On okizeme, her best chances are her mix-ups. So just stay on the ground until 
she pokes or until a safe opportunity to stand/roll away comes along. Be patient!
      Range 3 tactics are best because it can take away Julia's CH and elbow game. 
If Julia comes close in, keep away with a pair of jabs and retreat until a better 
opportunity comes along. The goal is to achieve enough distance for a 4~3, u/f+3, 
(f,f+3) to go in to a duckling series. Ling is better around walls, so retreating to 
the side of stage may put Ling at the advantage. In the end, be safe and play smart 
in order to beat Julia.

H4e. Lee
      Lee is a character that can be used in much the same way Ling is used. His speed 
is his asset, and a super easy character to control. In Tekken 4, with the addition of 
walls, Lee has been given new strength. Walls give him the ability to take extra damage 
with every wall push and juggle. He is also one of the few characters that can out 
distance Ling.
      The mist step, previously useless, can be now used at the ends of certain moves. 
This gives Lee a major advantage in controlling a fight. The 1,2 jab mist step when 
used in a juggle can carry an opponent all the way to a wall (where Lee is strong). 
Using the mist step in neutral fighting gives Lee the opportunity to mix-up (throw, 
hopkick, low pick). To add to his speed, Lee has some fast strings that are safe 
like (d+4, n+4,3,3). He can take a mountain of damage with simple, safe picking 
strings.
      The Lee set-ups are evil. The simplest one is a 1,2 jab mist step to a throw. 
The overhead somersault at the correct distance can hit a blocking opponent. The step 
kicks (d+4,4,4,4) can be delayed, and can "stun" opponents getting off the ground. An 
instant hitman stance execution from crouching (confusion).
      Don't fight Lee against walls. His 4,4,4 or 1,2,4 will score huge points of damage 
against Ling after a wall push. If it can't be avoided and Ling has to face Lee against 
the walls, make extra sure that he can't land a wall push or juggle.
      Ling can beat Lee in two of his strongest areas: speed and sidestepping. Fight Lee 
accordingly. AOP can kick his jab game, and a fast AOP can destroy it. Ling's custom 
strings at range 0 are also killer. Lee has a few good moves that track, but still not 
good enough for Ling. The hypnotist dance works the best, not the rain dance triple SS. 
Lee will be helpless.
      The other weak point of Lee is his pace. I've seen very few players who can keep 
a good, rhythmic pace with Lee. They'll get caught up in the mist steps and jabs, and 
lose pace just for an instant. This gives Ling a momentum advantage. She'll have a much 
easier time using set-ups in this match.
      Lee is a great character, but a tough fight against Ling. Fight Lee on Ling's 
terms: range 0, out in the open. Fortunately for Ling, she's just faster. But beware, 
Lee will always be better when fighting around a wall.
      *AHEM, I AM A RETARD. I need to mention Lee's SS+2. SS+2,f~n, 1,2,4 is all
guaranteed. Sorry. SS+2 avoids jabs and most high moves. However, Ling's d/f+1
and AOP can work rather well against the SS+2.
		
H4f. Xiaoyu
      One of the greatest feats of irony in the entire game is that the best character 
on can play is often the character one is weakest against. Don't underestimate any 
character, this match does not simply equate to player versus player. Xiaoyu can take 
advantage of some weaknesses that another Xiaoyu may have.
      First rule, watch the opponent. What tactics do they use? What tactics don't 
they use? Second, where is the advantage... out in the open, near a wall, uphill, 
downhill, close in, far away? Play smart. This is where practicing near walls comes 
in handy. If you face a Ling who is weaker around walls, it's a definite advantage.
      Even though I stress that there is are advantages and disadvantages in this 
fight, it is true that in the end, it's player versus player. All the tactics, 
set-ups, strategies, etc. can be used by the other Ling. The difference simply lies 
in who uses Ling better, and who can handle an opponent's Ling better. I've faced 
players who use Ling better than me, but have a harder time fighting against her.
      *I have an anti-ling section in this FAQ somewhere, you may want to check
it out.

H4g. Marduk
      With Tekken 4 comes the arrival of this monster. Marduk is power. He can control 
every range, every sidestep, and every predictable pitbull. People new to T4 are 
hesitant when fighting Marduk, because he is an unknown player.
      When fighting Marduk, don't get tackled. I repeat, don't get tackled. It is 
possible to use hopling to get around him, but crouch punches work better. Worst 
case scenario, try to break it with both punches. The throw break window is a tad 
small, but not impossible. Once in the tackle, it's a rock paper scissors game. Not to 
mention Marduk maintains momentum for another 10 seconds or so.
      Marduk can fight at range 3, 2, 1, and 0. There's no zone tactics versus him 
because he can strike at any level (high, mid, low) at any range. At a distance he 
can use his sidestep or his long sweeping moves. At close range, his throws are deadly.
      The Marduk sidestep can be extremely tough to counteract. Unfortunately, it does 
beat Ling's. I use a SSL walk or a hypnotist dance to get near him and then pray I can 
beat him to the punch with a jab. An u/f+3 at a distance may also work. In any case, 
Ling can not use her linear moves when Marduk is in SS mode.
      Fighting Marduk wouldn't be that hard at all... if it wasn't for that cursed 
reversal. Marduk can reverse high and reverse mid. A player with fast reaction time 
can easily control the fight with just these moves alone. Another move that kills 
jabbers are his launchers. Both his d+1+2, and d/b+1+2 can travel under punches 
and juggle.
      Ling can beat Marduk, but she has to control the fight. Travel in and out of 
zones very quickly. Her middle jabs can beat Marduk (d/f+1, ... 1,d+2), as long as 
he doesn't have time to react. Duckling is good against any Marduk because there 
is not much he can do (no hopkick or fast uppercut). Don't try to out sidestep 
Marduk, his moves track too well. Keep the fight in Ling's hands and she will win. 
Get tackled and it's an uphill battle for the rest of the fight.

H4h. Lei
      Toned down in T4, but still a force to be reckoned with in the hands of a skilled 
player. Lei's strength is in his set-up and distance game. Most of his strings are best 
out of range 2, where Ling is weak. Lei is also strong at turtling, another area where 
Ling is weak at. However, most of the strengths that Lei has can be taken away from him.
      The most feared tactic of the kung-fu master is Lei-down. Lei can turtle while on 
the ground, making it nearly impossible to fight as a pitbull. Be cautious around Lei 
when he is in this position, and know the moves he can execute at all times. For 
example, when Lei is face down head feet away, a slide is most likely coming. So stay 
back and prepare to block low. Ling's okizeme should prove useful when fighting the 
Lei down.
      Right next to Lei-down tactics are the stances. Again, learn all of the moves 
from the stance. Also note that Lei can auto parry many moves from his stances. 
One thing to watch out for in his stances is the sidestep. He can sidestep dodge a 
move in to a stance, then counter with devastating damage. Use fast pokes and pitbull 
techniques to keep him out of the stances. 
      Lei's strings and sweeps. His strings can hit many different levels and are very 
confusing. Some of his strings can even be delayed. Watch out for a razor rush with the 
last punch, kick combination delayed. Another would be the simple kicking combination 
4~4,3> ankle kick (d+4). His sweep makes up for what his strings lack: tracking and 
the ability to hit AOP. Favor AOP more often then not, but block the sweep enough 
to make the opponent scared of using it.
      The final weapon is Lei's ability to beat pitbulls. His backturn retreat will 
escape a jab, then come back with an uppercut. Lei can drop down, or even use his 
cannonball headbutt. Lei can even beat some of the fastest characters to their jab 
with his razor rush.
      In order to beat Lei, Ling has to take away his advantage. Make the opponent 
weary to use most of his moves and turtle. When Lei turtles it is the perfect 
opportunity to use set-ups. When Lei goes on offense, use AOP and evasion. Sidestep 
works well against everything but the sweep. Block the sweep. Not an impossible 
fight if Ling can take away Lei's offense.
      *Watch JOP tactics. Hop, *back turned* 2_d+1
		
H4i. Kazuya
      The man, the myth, the Mishima. The same Kazuya with some new toys that can 
wreak havoc on characters. The walls give him news strength where other characters fail. 
A well built character for the purpose of force rather than style.
      Don't go after Kazuya near walls during neutral fighting.. Or at least try to 
avoid it. His mix-up game is at it's peak in this area. Kazuya can close the gap 
easily with some of his moves. At close range he can mix up his strong mids and the wall 
push. Use the sidestep game to get around walls as much as possible.
      Kazuya is not a character for style, but he makes up for it. He can mount a decent 
effort in nearly every aspect of the game. His news stomp (d+4) gives him strong 
okizeme. The walls give him strong throwing power. The only thing he lacks is a good 
sidestep game. Ling can dance circles around him if he isn't careful.
      Unfortunately for Ling, sidestepping isn't good enough. Kazuya's jabs beat out 
Ling's in priority and speed, his mid moves can beat out duckling, he can wait out 
range 3 tactics, and he can pitbull through a set-up. Against a great Kazuya player, 
there's nothing Ling can do.
      This fight comes down to a battle of will. Ling can sidestep and jab for a little 
bit before an opponent will catch on. After that, it's up to mind games. Confuse the 
heck out of Kazuya. Get the opponent to turtle so Ling can use set-ups and duckling. 
Jab only when it is free, Kazuya does have some moves that will go around jabs.
      One tiny trick to watch out for against Kazuya is the wave/light dash. If Kaz 
is in range 3, he can begin a wave/light dash. It's a crouch dash that repeats itself 
over and over, really quickly. Don't get caught looking at it! Kazuya can mix things 
up very well from this, and from a regular crouch dash.
      Kazuya is a basic character, so you won't find players trying to use him like 
Ling. Ling does have the option of turtling for the first few seconds to try and find a 
weakness in the opponent, but it's risky. The Hopling retreat may buy the time she 
needs. If Ling tries to go pitbull v pitbull against Kazuya, it's her prerogative. 
But he's just a sturdy character when played right.
      The key to winning this fight? Don't make mistakes.
      *THAT MEANS DO NOT GO IN TO AOP SO OFTEN AND DON'T GET HIT BY WS+2!
		
H4j. Paul
      The scariest character this side of Jin. Paul has the ability to be brutal, plain 
and simple. He is the holder of the dreaded deathfist, not to mention strings that hit 
all levels safely. A jab the has priority over nearly every other move. A fairly good 
low hitting move (SS+3)to use as mix-up for the death fist. An attack reversal to throw 
off another player's momentum. The best wall game in Tekken. Killer okizeme, the best 
around corners. Moves that can evade jabs and cause sizeable damage. Not to mention his 
new haircut.
      This is a tough fight for Ling. Paul can finish a match in 10 seconds if she 
isn't careful. The deathfist is strong enough to take half of Xiaoyu's lifebar on a 
counter hit. Pitbull against Paul, and he goes back to a 1,2 jab combination. The 
sidestep works best against the deathfist. SSR will evade the move more often, but 
you can still get away with a hypnotist dance at range 2.
      AOP and rain dance are tough to use on this guy, so don't stay in them long. 
His new, high priority, high-speed shoulder push (d+1+2) can hit Ling out of both.
      When it comes to Ranges, fight Paul range 0-1 a little bit less than usual. Stick 
to the sidestep in range 2 or 3. Range 3 is another place Ling should be. A 4~3 or 
u/f+3 can put Ling in prime position for some low strings and mix-up. Also, 99% of 
the time... when Ling goes in to a SSL or a hypnotist dance, Paul will SS+3. I've seen 
it a billion times, and punish every time I do.
      Try not to fight Paul around walls. It's asking for trouble. He can easily mix-up 
in that scenario. And even if Ling tries to pitbull, he can 1,2 jab her to death. Plus, 
there's the added fear of being knocked down in a corner. A cheesy player can hammer 
fist Ling for the rest of the match and win. So just stay away from the walls.
      Character versus character, Paul will win. The player (YOU) needs to concentrate, 
think ahead, and play flawlessly. Mind games should be priority over anything else. The 
only advantage Ling has over Paul is her sidestep, but the player has to make up for 
everything else.
      A few tricks to watch out for: Paul running up to Ling and d+4_f,f+1+2. Whenever 
he dashes in, jab! Be wary of the SS+3_deathfist mix-up. Learn to read his dash the 
instant the opponent inputs it.
      This is another fight where Ling can't afford to make any mistakes. 
Deathfist! Deathfist! Deathfist!
      *USMCogre trick* Wall push, d+4, ... SS+3. If the opponent does an instant stand,
he's burnt toast.
		
H4k. Jin
      The Mishima monster returns, renewed and with a vengeance. Out performs every 
character in jabs, picking strings, and juggles. While he doesn't have the power of 
Paul, he does have more control. Jin can manipulate nearly every fighting scenario with 
just a few moves. His new JF laser scraper is the most feared move in the game. It is 
nearly impossible to defend against. The only bright side for Ling, the JF 
laser scrapper is hard to pull off on a consistent basis.
      In order to beat Jin, Ling has to worm around his strings. The jab-axekick (1,2,3) 
series can be sidestepped on the third hit. So can the laser scraper. His low poking 
hits can be real bothersome, so keep the pressure on for as long as possible. Also, 
the best jab series in the game (2,1)... watch the throw after this move connects. 
Jin doesn't have many great mid launchers, so stay ducked after this move connects.
      Jin's main goal is to get his opponent in the air. While in the air he can juggle, 
then dominate on okizeme. A counter hit laser scraper to a simple juggle, low sweep, 
can lead to serious damage. Beware the double kick (d+3+4). It can hit Ling out of 
AOP. If the first hit is blocked, Ling still has to block the mid coming right after.
      Finally, and unfortunately for Ling, Jin has been given a defensive move. His new 
parry can shuffle a string to the side and leave Jin a juicy opportunity for a juggle 
or a throw. What does this mean for Ling? Not much considering that she doesn't have 
many high-mid strings. But don't get caught overusing a jab or any other mid moves. Jin 
will parry, launch, juggle, control. Death follows shortly thereafter.
      Beware the laser scraper. You'll see more half completed laser scrapers in a 
tournament than any other move. On a counter hit it is basically a guaranteed juggle 
(when facing a good opponent). I've seen brilliant Ling players lose to Jin simply 
because they kept getting hit by this move. Answer? Don't get caught in range 2. Even 
range 1 is risky against Jin because of his jabs. Fight in range 0. Duckling still 
works if Ling is fast enough (fear the double kick). The distance tactics still work, 
just beware Jin's f,n,D/F+4>4~3.
      The hardest part about fighting Jin, the character doesn't make mistakes. It is a 
simple character to control and use, so players don't often make huge mistakes. Ling has 
to play smart. THIS DOES NOT MEAN STICK TO JABS. I saw a match a few months ago where 
Ling was ahead by two rounds and started relying on the jab out of safety. Jin easily 
made up the two rounds back (but still lost in the last round). Don't fight Jin jab 
versus jab. Fight Jin with set-ups if possible. Control the fight as long as possible. 
Jabs are secondary. Sidesteps are tertiary (third). Jin is unbeatable, but the person 
using him isn't.
      *After Jin's CD+4, d+4, DO NOT INSTANT STAND!
		
H4l. Nina
      The most under-rated character in all of Tekken. It's been recently discovered 
that Nina can actually deliver more of a wallop than was previously thought. Her jabs 
are her main weapon, as well as a strong sidestep and set-up game. At close range, she 
can beat out an opponent with speed and priority. Her blonde bomb (f+1+2) can knock 
Ling out of AOP at range 0-2 with relative ease. And the flurry of jabs ( plus an attack 
reversal) make it difficult for Ling to gain momentum.
      At range 0, Ling still has an advantage if she uses her faster attacks. Ranges 1,2 
are a bit difficult to stay in because of the jabs, and the blonde bomb. Range 3 is open 
game, Ling can operate more effectively, but still needs to get through range 1-2 in 
order to strike.
      Nina is also effective at using the walls. Her overhead throw and wall push are 
both effective ways to take a chunk of damage off of someone. Nina can also keep you
in a corner very easily. Do not try to lure Nina to the walls... it is a very stupid
idea. Wall push to 3,4 is a death sentence to Ling.
      Don't get caught watching Nina. Many of her set-ups happen when she performs a 
cancel (or another intricate move) in to a more powerful move. Crouch punch out of 
reaction. If the reflexes aren't fast enough, don't let Nina have the time to set-up. 
Use range 0 duckling and pitbull. If Nina gets a few of her jabs out, she'll have 
the momentum.
      Fortunately, Ling can make a few mistakes without the threat of serious damage. 
Nina takes patience to play, as most of her moves don't take that much damage. 
Therefore, pitbull. Aside from the reversal, there's nothing to stop Ling at range 0. 
Make Nina afraid to fight. Out flurry her with jabs. If Nina does get momentum, fall 
back and sidestep. Pick your opportunity to jab and get back in the fray. Set-ups in 
this fight are secondary. As long as Ling can jab effectively, she should.
      *I take back everything that I said. Nina can not be beaten with Ling... easily.
      *Watch for ss+1, hiyadash, mixup

		
H4m. Steve
      Another new addition to the Tekken world... a annoying deadly one. This pugilist 
can punch faster than any other character in the game. Most of his strings can be 
executed without fear of retaliation. He has plenty of moves that can cause crumple 
stuns or OSB (Opponent turns side when blocked). He moves easily and gracefully, and 
can cause confusion just by dancing around the stage. This character does not have any 
set-ups outside of his custom strings, but frankly he doesn't need them. He can play 
safe, he can play daring. Doesn't matter to Steve.
      One thing that Steve does lack however, is the ability to knock Ling out of AOP 
quickly. AOP will kill any Steve player. The motion can duck under most of Steve's 
jabs, and a quick launcher after the whiff is guaranteed damage.
      Aside from the AOP weakness, Steve is nearly impossible to fight. Watch out for 
his (d/f+1,2,1... d/f+1,2,2) mix-up. The first will cause an OSB (high hit), the second 
causes a gut stun (mid hit). There's also a few custom strings like (SL 1~[B], FL [B]+2) 
and (1,2,1~[B], FL [B]+2). The extended crouching alsoadds some difficulty. The hook 
causes OSB (high hit) and the uppercut is a juggle. Don't get caught looking when 
Steve goes in to the Albatross Spin or the Flicker Backdash (b+1+2, f~b+1+2, f~b+1+2). 
SS+4 can work well against the Albatross Spin, and charge Steve (CAREFULLY) when he 
backdases.
      Try not to fight Steve pitbull versus pitbull. He is much better at range 0,1. 
Even at range 2 Steve has a fair amount of control. Outside of AOP, stay at the end 
of range 2 or range 3 unless you have momentum. For example, a demon flip (4~3) to a 
crouch punch can leave Ling in range 1 with a fair amount of momentum.
      Steve is a difficult fight for nearly every character. Ling is a character that 
has a natural advantage over Steve because of his reliance on fast hitting mid and 
high moves. But don't take Steve too lightly. A good player can overcome any 
disadvantage between characters.
      ****NEW****
      There is a new style of Steve emerging in the US. This style is completely
accredited to Stringbean out of Palmdale/Lancaster CA. It's a Turtle Steve.
The only time Stringbean has ever been defeated in a tournament is when JOP went
out of his way to turtle with Paul.
      The main tactic is to use the flicker backdash (b+1+2) to FL 2 to punish
all incoming people. It's a very damaging move that tracks well and leads in to
okizeme opportunity. IT IS VERY HARD TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS STYLE. Also watch for
the combo (d+1~b *CH*, FL 2, d/b+2) *60ish damage*. The way to get around this
is to turtle. I KNOW I HAVE SAID THAT TURTLING IS SUICIDE WITH LING, but try out
her hopling retreat and spinner away tactics. This might be worth looking in to.
      *example of Steve style: 1,2,1,  b+1+2 (opponent whiffs), FL 2
		
H4n. Christie
      One of my favorite characters to use besides Ling. Christie's auto tracking, 
low picks, great throws, fairly good launchers, and range 3 game put her in a great 
advantage in Tekken 4. Many of her moves have been revamped in Tekken for to cut down 
lag time, such as the Satellite Moon (4~3). Christie can stay in range 3 and take pot 
shots through the entire match. Or she can stay in range 1 and use her deceptive low 
picks. The launchers can be a pain to face, especially when mixed with Christie's 
throws.
      The low picks are the first thing that Ling needs to watch out for. The 
d+3~4 and SS+4 can be used at different ranges, but they share one deadly property. 
They aren't recover crouching, even if it seems that way! What does that mean? 
Christie can still use any move she normally could in standing... like throws, 
juggles, and other low picks. For example, a string like SS+4, d+3~4, 4~3 can strike 
the opponent twice low, then mid, and recover safely at range 2. There are a ton of 
custom strings like that, so follow Christie very closely. Ling doesn't have great 
priority so it can be tough.
      The launchers Christie has can be a pain to face. Both of them are fairly safe, 
even if blocked. Staying in range 0 and using the parting chop (D/F+1) can be an 
effective barrier against launchers and throws. Even a pair of jabs works. Be careful 
though, both her d/b+4 and d/b+1+2 with avoid the jabs.
	On a side not, you'll see alot of Christie players with jump over tactics. The 
reason for this is her combo of death. RD d+1 *opponent BT*, WS 1,3, RX 2, 12 44. It's
all garaunteed if she nails the first hit. So be kind and ground tech roll against
Christie. Her most damaging moves won't get you, and her okizeme will push you away,
leaving you free to stand up.
      If Christie loses her momentum, she has a hard time getting it back. Most likely, 
she'll try to create some space and regroup. When this happens, keep after her. This is 
where Ling can take the most damage away from Christie. Pitbull against her. Even though 
she has a strong game at close range, her far range game is better. If Ling keeps the 
momentum, it's a tough fight for Christie.      There are a few set-ups to watch out 
for. The most brilliant one I've seen is the relaxed 2, d/f+1+2. The relaxed 2 will 
recover standing (not crouching) at range 0, perfect for a throw. Like Jin's 2,1. 
Learn the moves that have the recover standing/recover crouching confusion and 
Xiaoyu will be much better off.
      Don't fight Christie with Ling's back to the wall. She is incredibly good around 
walls. People tend to lose focus around walls, which is exactly what Christie counts 
on. The hypnotist dance works well. Try to avoid the rain dance double sidestep. 
Christie can automatically track Ling when she sidesteps.
      In order to beat Christie, don't make mistakes. Know her capabilities, and her 
goofy tricks from low picks. If she manages to throw Ling, immediately double punch 
input. If she gets close, use the parting chop. Lose focus and it's over.
      *Common Christie Trick* RLX 4~3 (near wall), HND 4 *wall stun*
		
H4o. Bryan
      Bryan has been seriously toned down since Tekken Tag. He can still offer up some 
trouble with his basic moves, but it's really a tough fight for him. Fight Bryan with 
a modicum of intelligence and it's a guaranteed win.
      The best string that Bryan has is the d/f+1,2. The second hit is guaranteed of 
the fist connects. The first hit has fairly good properties. Weather the storm when 
it comes to this move. Ling will have the advantage of momentum after this move. 1,4,3 
is another string similar to this one. Same rules apply.
      The other move to look out for is the sweep. It hits low, fairly fast, and gives 
Bryan juggle opportunity. Ling can come out with a WS+4 after this move, but she has to 
be quick about it. A must, block this move or learn to pick Bryan out of it.
      He does have a set-up two left in his rotting corpse. Watch for the b+2,1~d 
cancel. He can sweep after this move. Another string with a cancel is 1,4,2,1~d. 
A parting chop works wonders in this situation. If not, just watch Bryan closely for 
the block/duck.
      Bryan does have a slight advantage around walls, but not enough to seriously 
avoid them all together. He has a tough time controlling the movement of the other 
character. Ergo, tough time moving Ling in position for wall damage.
      The best Bryan players that I've seen will pick away damage rather than go big. 
He has some great low/mid picks. Fortunately, Ling can out-pitbull Bryan with ease. 
But don't be predictable. The one parry that Bryan has is fairly effective when people 
get careless. Don't get careless.
      In the match up, fight with Ling's strengths. Pitbull, stay out of range 2, etc. 
The only thing that Bryan has is a fairly good set of moves that track. So avoid the 
sidestep game. Play smart, control the tempo, control the fight.

H4p. Heihachi
      Every Tekken I wonder how this guy is able to walk, let alone fight. A diaper? 
Now things have got bad for the geriatric. Alright, enough of the teasing. Heihachi 
can kick Ling's ass. Not because he can out pitbull or move better. He has very few 
moves of actual worth, which keeps the opponent from making mistakes. Heihachi can 
fight well at range 0-1,1,2. His hammer fist still gives him the advantage in corners. 
The classic 1,1,2 combo works after wall pushes. The d/f+1,2 punishes people who make 
mistakes. The quasi-deathfist (diet coke of deathfist) is a powerful mid move.
      First, learn how to block the demon sweep (f,n,d/f+4,4,4) after the first hit. 
Otherwise, Ling just might as well fall over and die. Don't be tricked in this tekken, 
blocking it won't stop the string. So just be patient. It's a fairly easy move to watch.
      Don't make punishable mistakes. Don't use moves that will Ling open for more 
than 10 frames (standing) or 15 frames in AOP. Fortunately, Ling can abuse her jabs all 
she wants. She can also abuse the Hypnotist walk. Avoid the double SS rain dance 
because of Heihachi's standing 4. She can also use duckling with little threat of 
retaliation.
      Fight Heihachi close range. If Ling wanders beyond range 2, Heihachi is in 
control. He can use his wave dash mix-up at a distance. Abuse the jabs and duckling 
and Ling won't have to worry about most of Heihachi's super damaging moves. Set-ups 
are alright if Ling has momentum. There's nothing really special about Heihachi to 
counter them.
      Key to this fight: being a smart pitbull. Attacking while making few mistakes. 
If the fight is in neutral, stay as close as possible. Use moves that will put Ling 
at range 0-1. Mind games still work. Set-ups work as long as they are well executed. 
Fight Heihachi in the open more often than not, but it's not a huge deal if both 
fighters end up parallel to a wall. Just don't get caught in a corner. Ever.
      Know Heihachi's moves and he is powerless. He can't hurt Ling unless she let's him.
      NEW: Ok. I was wrong. DO NOT PITBULL AGAINST HEIHACHI. Turtle. Read the turtle
section for further details.
		
H4q. King
      King, armed with a fair arsenal of powerful moves, can wait for a mistake and 
easily punish it. His throws are the best in the game, and they always will be. This 
jab combinations aren't half bad, and he has some fair low moves. His deadly boomerang 
(SS+3+4) is his long distance saving grace, along with the capitol punishment 
(u/f+1+2). At range 1-2, the stomach smash (f,f,n+2) will kill Xiaoyu if she stays in 
that range. What few set-ups king does have can take a fair amount of damage. Overall, 
a good character. But, Ling outclasses King in nearly every area except power.
      Most good King players won't even use his throws unless the opportunity presents 
itself. They will stick to the jab combinations, low picks, and hop kick... with a few 
power moves. Ling has a faster jab and the parting chop (D/F+1) still works wonders. 
To beat King's combinations, block mid and gain some momentum after the move. Against 
moves like the shin kick (d/f+4), be patient. The move doesn't do that much damage, 
and it's much better to be hit by that and not a headspinner or a hopkick. Range 0, 
jab like mad. Range 1, be patient.
      Range 3 probably goes to King in this fight. He has some options if Ling opens 
the gap. He can use the deadly boomerang, capitol punishment, a crouch dash mix-up, a 
cannonball sidestep (SS 3+4~D)... etc.  He can also close the gap and use intermediate 
range moves like the stomach smash. On a counter hit, the stomach smash will do a ton 
of damage, and leave Ling open for okizeme.
      A few set-ups to watch out for: the stun push (f,f,n+1+2) to a giant swing. It 
won't connect unless Ling tries to go forward. Another set-up is the cannonball 
sidestep to a hopkick. It works in the same way that Ling's AOP roll to WS+4 works. On 
okizeme, King has a few things he can do with the capitol punishment. Advice, stay on 
the ground against King for a second, then get up.
      The problem with the King v Ling match is that King has nothing that can really 
stop Ling's strengths. The jabs at range 0-1, the sidesteps, or duckling. So, do what 
Ling does best. Pitbull like mad. Keep in mind what King is capable of, he can still 
kill Ling with a few moves... just don't dwell on it.
		
H4r. Law
      Back from Tekken 2, Marshall has been rebuilt... they made him faster, stronger, 
tougher. Strong in jabs, juggles, set-ups, defense, throws, range control, and counter 
hit tactics. The only areas that he craps out in are okizeme and wall offense. But 
frankly, he really doesn't need it to give a beating.
      They had to go and give Law a strong jab combination. Damn. Law's 1,2,3 is one of 
the most annoying moves in the game. Auto-tracking, a mid, guard break, guaranteed on a 
counter hit, and fast. If ever Ling is facing an opponent who does this move over and 
over, smack them (the player), then parry the first jab. This move will give Law tons 
of momentum. A parting chop is the only good offensive move I can really suggest 
against this jab string.
      Law's juggles are annoyingly damaging. A counter hit dragon storm (b+1,2,1) to a 
double flip will take nearly half of Xiaoyu's lifebar. A knee lift (f,f+3+4) to a 
b+2,{3},4, b~f~b~[f] [f]+1 can also take a heft amount. Law has a few good launchers, 
and many ways to follow them up. Really, the only way to avoid a juggle is not to get 
hit by the launcher. THIS IS ABSOLUTE FACT. So, don't get hit by the juggle. Easier 
said than done, but try. Keep your finger on the [1] escape and block mid until 
otherwise directed.
      Somewhere there's a tekken player cursing the day law was ever given a parry. And 
not only does he have one parry, no- not even two, three parries. The regular parry 
(b+2+4_b+1+3) can be quite a pain. It can grab any mid/high move and use it against 
the other person. It can also be followed by the DSS in to a back fist. Example, Ling 
jabs, Law parries... b~f~b~[f] [f]+1. He has two other parries, the DSS parry and the 
punch parry. Each can be followed up with powerful moves. Law is the only character in 
the game that can make an offense out of a defense... so be careful. Change the tempo 
of Ling's attacks.
      Set-ups with Law are a-plenty. I've seen a bunch with the parry alone. For 
example, Law does a WS+2 (which recovers better than people think) which is blocked, 
the opponent charges in and Law parries. Law can also use his counter hit tactics in 
that situation (i.e WS+2 b+1,2,1). Even a 1,2 jab followed by a parry is effective. 
Just keep on guard. Another set-up is the U/F+3 mix-up. Normally, the U/F+3 is followed 
by a mid...but some players can mix it with the ground slide. So if you see someone at 
range 3 use a U/F+3, BLOCK LOW. Another mix-up to that would be a throw.The last type 
of set-ups he has are the delays or shadows. Watch the b+1,2>1. There's also DSS 1>f+1. 
And every now and then you'll see a u/f+4,3.
      Law doesn't have a range 3 game, but he makes up for it. He can close the gap 
better than anyone in the game IMO. He can even get in range 0 with little threat of 
retaliation by means of the U/F+4 (recovers better than expected). Little strings like 
b+2, d+1 can put Law in a great position for damage. The 1,2,3 will close the gap easily 
from range 1-2. Law can even retreat away with moves like 4,3 b~f. He can move easier 
through the ranges than most characters. Especially now since they took out the back 
handspring *sobs*.
      Fight Law with brains. This is a battle of the mind when it comes between two 
characters that have so many set-ups. Don't fight Law where he's strong. Use duckling 
mix-up, a few set-ups, and jabs sparingly. 
	A few tricks to watch out for... Law's that jump. If he gets a jump over he can
do a RD 1. Which he can lead in to this combo: RD 1, u/f+4, 4,3,4, b~f~b~f, 3... all
guaranteed. The 1,2,3 bait in to a QCF+1,2. 1,2,u/f+3, ff+3+4. 4,u+3, QCF 1,2
	DON'T BE AFRAID TO THROW LAW WHEN YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO PARRY. Sidestep at a 
distance, but beware... Law can track at close range (f+1+2, 4, SS+3+4). Play smart. 
Stay on the ground or by a wall. The person who makes the fewest mistakes, wins.
      *Intel Trick* crouch stutter in to WS+2, slide mixup
      *Intel Combo* U/F+4, U/F+4, d~d/f~d~d/f+3
      *Lingmassacre Trick* crouch stutter in to WC U/F+4, slide mixup ... especially okizeme



H5. Character Versus Character Lineup
-------------------------------------

     Just a quick blurb on character versus character. There is much more detail I
can go in to with each of these matches but that takes an incredible amount of time.
Besides, this is a Ling FAQ... the character lineup is just an added bonus. People
will differ with me on some of these descriptions so don't take my word as gospel.
This is just a humble writer's opinion.


Hwo:
--Hwo     -- This match comes down to which player has better SS and jab skills.
--Kuma    -- Kuma has advantage with ff+2. Hwo should play conservative.
--Yoshi   -- Fair match, just as long as Hwo knows Yoshi's tricks. (i.e. b,b+1~1 setups)
--Julia   -- Julia's strength is in CH setups. Hwo should SS alot.
--Ling    -- Hwo has advantage. Use B+3 against AOP. Ling needs to use jab offense.
--Lee     -- Hwo should use anti-jab moves. Lee has free reign on SS+2.
--Marduk  -- Marduk can not stay on ground for too long. Hwo shouldn't use predictable strings.
--Lei     -- Lei shouldn't rely on ground tactics. Hwo can use setups against Lei.
--Kaz     -- Kaz can move better, more options off crouch dash. Hwo should use strings.
--Jin     -- Tough match for Hwo. Know Jin's setups. Play conservative Hwo.
--Paul    -- Tough match for Hwo. Get Paul scared and use setups.
--Nina    -- Tough match for Hwo. Ivory cutter is too good. Hwo can't track hayadash.
--Steve   -- Use Low moves against Steve whenever possible. Steve should pitbull.
--Bryan   -- Don't duck against Bryan unless necessary. Try stance swictch backdash to RFF 3~4.
--Christie-- Use b+3, d/b+4,4 to punish Christie on ground. Christie should use jabs/setups.
--King    -- Hwo shouldn't use strings. King should capitalize on throw setups.
--Hei     -- Hei, d+1, nuff said. Hwo can use strings here fairly effectively.
--Law     -- Hwo shouldn't use strings. Law can reverse. Law should be able to use mixups.

Kuma:
--Kuma    -- Bait the CH f+1,1,1.
--Yoshi   -- Yoshi needs to use Okizeme whenever possible. Kuma has good CHf+1,1,1 opportunity.
--Julia   -- JULIA SHOULD USE ELBOWS (ff+1). Kuma play more defensively. Backdash, f,f+2.
--Ling    -- Tough match for Ling. She can't punish f,f+2. Play conservative against Kuma.
--Lee     -- Tough match for Lee. Kuma should use f,f+2. Lee can't punish.
--Marduk  -- Marduk can not stay on ground. Use d+4 alot. Kuma can't use f,f+2 as well.
--Lei     -- Backdash to BT will be hard for Lei. Kuma has free reign on f,f+2 I think.
--Kaz     -- Kaz should use crouch dash to close gap. Kuma should bait CH f+1,1,1
--Jin     -- Kuma at disadvantage. Use bear jab (f+1) alot. Jin, crouch dash to mixup.
--Paul    -- Paul is better around walls. Kuma's FF+2 can go under deathfist.
--Nina    -- Kuma can not stay on the ground for long. Nina can't use hayadash as effectively.
--Steve   -- STEVE CAN PUNISH f,f+2 with f,f+2. Kuma needs to rely on bearjab.
--Bryan   -- Bryan should use knee (ws+3) a fair amount. Bryan can punish f,f+2 with f,f+2.
--Christie-- Christie has advantage with u/f+4. She has better wall game too.
--King    -- Tough match for King. Poor king.
--Hei     -- D+1 like a madman. Use 1+2 whenever Kuma comes close. Kuma use f,f+2.
--Law     -- Kuma needs to watch d/b+4. Use bear jab.

I. CUSTOM
#########

      Here are a few custom strings that I like to use. These are just a series of moves 
that are relatively safe or have a high probability of connecting. That's my definition 
of a custom string.
      Of course, certain strings only work in certain places. No one would attempt a 
string best suited forrange 1 at range 3. Nor would anyone want to try a slow string 
against a character like Law or Julia. Finding the best possible environment for the 
string is necessary when using them. Use your discretion.

-1, d+2, RDS d+1
: A simple string. Nothing fancy, just meat and potatoes. Which is what makes it so 
good. The only weakness that this move has is the third hit (it can be parried). It 
isn't much of a weakness, unless the opponent knows it's coming. Use this string at 
range 1 or 0. The jab beats out most, and so will the low crouch punch. This puts Ling 
exactly where she needs to be for mix-up. For example... 1,d+2, RD d+1, WS+4 or ... 
1,d+2, RD d+1, WC d/f+4,4. This is one of the best ways to get in to duckling 
imaginable.

-1,2, d+4
: A 1,2 jab with a low hit. It's almost inconceivable to have anyone block the third 
hit, or be able to come out with a faster move. This will put Ling at the edge of 
range 1 while crouching. There are a few things she can follow up with... immediate 
AOP roll, raccoon swing (ff+3), XMTS (ff+1+2, 1+2)... but that's up to the 
imagination.

-[D/F]+1, [D/F]+1
: I've always liked the parting chop because it can go under certain jabs. It's a fast 
mid hit that can interrupt an opponent's momentum very easily. After this string, an 
opponent is likely to turtle for a nanosecond or two. Good for an XMTS, or as I like 
to do, drop in to AOP and firecracker (AOP 4~3). Another good follow up is the Wang 
Sweep (SS+4). After a while, Ling can switch and just use one parting chop with 
the same effectiveness.

-1,2 (hit), d/b+3, f,f+1+2,1+2
: I covered this one earlier, but it is still good. One of the best ways to keep 
momentum for a few seconds. More often than not this will be safe. The only option the 
opponent has is to crouch punch after the stun. Not much of a weakness if you as me.

-1, D+2, SS+4
: The first two hits create a sizeable distance between both characters. Just right for 
range 2 moves like the raccoon swing or the sweep. I like the Wang sweep because it is 
more likely to hit. The raccoon swing can be blocked (best case scenario, counter hit. 
Recovery bait).

-1, D+2, D/F+1, f,f+3
: If the first two hits connect, the rest of the string is effectively uninterruptable.
It's just a simple little picking string with a recover set-up at the end. Nothing
hidden here. Good recovery all round if the first two hits connect. If they don't,
keep working the jabs.

-D/F+1, d/f+1, RD d/b,
: This is a great string for a set-up. Nine times out of ten the opponent will charge,
right in to a WC Ling. Bad bad bad for them. Mix up is the name of the game in this
case. WC d/f+4,4... WS+4... cart blanche` here.

-D/F+1 (blocked), SS+4, SS+4
: The parting chop will put some distance in between the two characters. Which is great
for the sweep. Be careful with the second sweep though, you'll have to sidestep up. That
is the only way to recover crouching in to an SS. It works the same for an AOP too...
Which may give you some ideas later on.

-4~3, WC [d+1]
: I like this move when I know I can beat another player to the crouch punch, and if 
I know that they won't parry it. The reason why I put the d+1 in brackets is because it 
can go in to AOP. For example, 4~3, WC [d+1], [d+1]+2, 4~3. Or... 
4~3, WC [d+1], [d+1]+[2], [2]+4. Good for damage when needed. Eventually, 
go over to 4~3>d+1+2 ... the crouch punch will be parried.

-4~3, WS+4
: Use this when the opponent gets wise to 4~3, WC d+1. This string can be interrupted
by a crouch punch.

-4~3, SSU, 4~3
-4~3, low parry
: Use this when the opponent gets wise to 4~3, WS+4. The previous three custom strings
complete the 4~3 offensive strategy.

-D/F+[1], SSL, b+[1]+2
: My favorite way to get in to Hypnotist. Create some space, sidestep, hypnotist. 
The spinsticker after this string will hit more often than not, even against experienced 
players. But I like to list this string because of the options. See the section on the 
Hypnotist for further ideas after this move.

-f,f+1+2,1+2, d+[2], f,f+1+[2],1+2
: This is one of the ways I like to use RC canceling. The first XMTS will put the 
opponent at guard. The crouch punch will follow that up, relatively safely. And the 
following XMTS will punish when the opponent tries to go back on the offensive. There 
are punches that can beat out the second XMTS, but none so damaging as to cause great 
harm. A very safe string to use. The thing Ling loses if it fails is momentum.

-f,f+3, RD d+1
: One of the more common methods of closing the gap. Not really much to this move... 
it can go in to duckling, it's fairly safe, covers a long range. I use this when I am 
farther back, so I won't get taken out by jabs. Unfortunately, using it at a distance 
will give the opponent a period of time for CH opportunity. More on accident than 
skill. Use this string, but don't depend on it.

-WC d/f+4, AOP 1, WS+4
: A fantastic way to go in to AOP, a fantastic way to get out of AOP. Again, very 
few weaknesses to this string. There are a few moments Ling can be hit between the 
first and second move, but again... not real serious. The AOP 1 to WS+4 is recovery 
bait. The only real danger is if the first hit is blocked, then it is possible to 
get in a uppercut (if the opponent has one).

-RDS D+[3], b+[3]+4, RDS D+[3], b+[3]+4
: This is the best string involving the back circle breaker. The only real trick is 
providing a set-up that ensures the likely probability of the first hit connecting. 
Beyond that, this string is lovely. If one of the back circle breakers connects on CH, 
there's a chance to float. After this string is completed, easy chance for mix-up. The 
reverse hop kick is my favorite... launches with relative safety.

-WC d/f+[4], AOP b+3+[4], RDS D+3
: A bunch of people get caught watching this move, even though there is a ton of 
weakness in this move. This is more of a set-up than a string... but I wanted to give 
an idea of how to use the back circle breaker. Use the best of abilities to ensure that 
the first hit isn't blocked, and this string is safe.

-SS+4, u/f+3~d+1+2
: It looks very funky, which is part of the reason why it is good. It's a low pick, 
RC cancel to a mid move, then back to AOP at range 0-1. Good place to be for a mix-up. 
Problem is, it's funky. Some players will jab on instinct, others won't. Give it a 
try... worst case scenario, Ling takes a jab or two and loses momentum. Best case... 
both hits connect.

-RDS 2, SSR, RDS 2
: This is called the dark and stormy pressure. It first came in to style in Tekken 3 as 
a way to feign strength. Personally, I don't like it... but I'll put it in here as an 
idea of what it is. It's fairly safe (against a human opponent who doesn't jab at that 
particular moment), and it does provide some time if they turtle. Good opportunity for 
a back circle breaker or a throw.

-WC [d]+1, [d]/b+3+4, RDS [d]+1, [d]/b+3+4
: It's one of the shining examples of the duckling style. I use this more often than 
the back circle breaker string, as it is much easier to get in to. Unfortunately, it 
does less damage. All of the hits are low though, so chances are they'll connect. 
After this string, there's a simple mix-up. I like the reverse hop kick. And I 
have nailed in on advanced players. This string is fairly safe if the opponent is 
slower to think than react.

-1+3 *wall stun*, 1,D+2
: The standard when it comes to the wall push. This provides some options. Basically, 
a guessing game. Will the opponent stand or duck. Personally, I like following this 
string up with a bayonet Mctwist that goes in to rain dance (1,d+2)... and going in 
to another string. But, there are more options... like another wall push, a pair of 
jabs, d+4, or d+1. Each has their own properties, use accordingly. Follows up with
the setup, ... *wall stun* 1, D+2, d/f+3, d/b+1, u/f+4, 4~3

-f,f+1+2, D/F+1
: This is Kev's trick (Vegas) which he got off of Kenbou. The f,f stuns and the d/f
is safe against jabs. Personally, I just like throwing out the XMTS by itself. It's
good setup in to other stuff, but this is worth putting in there. It's safe as hell.
Actually, even if you whiff, the d/f will avoid most everything that comes after, 
and you can crouch away.

-d+3, d/f+2~1
: This will hit alot of the time. Especially if you train your opponen to expect
multiple d+3.

-1+3 *wall stun*, 1,d+2, RD d+1, 1+3
-1+3 *wall stun*, 1,d+2, RD u+4
:Ling's primary mix-up when it comes to the wall game. Know your opponent, and
rule the walls!

-b+1+2, HYP 2, d/b+1
: Definately the most powerful custom string that I use. The d/b+1 is fairly safe
after HYP 2. The trick is making enougn space for the HYP 2. It's absolutely golden
when the d/b+1 connects.





I1. My Hop N' Throw Setups
--------------------------

      It's always better to have some kind of signature move. Mine just happens to be
my fanatical devotion and interest reguarding the hop n' throw. I love this move! Fear
rules tekken. If you are afraid or intimidated of/by your opponent, you have already
lost. The hop n' throw is a GREAT way to make people scared of you. REALLY scared.

-RD juggle, RD f+3+4, Hn'T
: My first one. This one is modified from Shauno's old okizeme game. Alot of people
can see this coming from me now, but in the beginning, no one can see it coming. Use
this in tournament ONCE and only ONCE. Everybody will know it is coming from then on
in. The best players will break the throw when it gets there, but noobs can't see it.

-AOP b+3+4, Hn'T
: This comes out soooo fast, no one sees it coming. This is my favorite technique for
getting it now. Especially towards the end of a match that I am winning. Run up to
a person, go in to AOP (which SCARES THE CRAP out of alot of people), and then do it.
Normally, just mix it in to your game once or twice. DO NOT DO THIS AGAINST A JIN
UNLESS IT IS A SCRUBBY JIN.

-f+1+2, Hn'T
: I think I mentioned this earlier, but I am doing it again. The cartwheel puts Ling
in to RD if she is close enough (range 2, max). It avoids alot of stuff. Then Hop
N' Throw. Don't do this on advanced players because Ling tends to be back to back
with the opponent. When this happens, good people will crouch backwards in to facing
Ling again... which means no Hop N' Throw for Ling. But good to throw out every now
and again.

-d+3 (on grounded opponent), Hn'T
: Still working out the kinks on this one. Just now thought of it. If you use d+3
on grounded people it will put Ling in to RD. Wait for them to tech (fear o 4~3),
and boom there you go. Not something that is expected. If they roll away, cali
roll along with them and maybe you'll get it then. To tell you the truth, I've 
NEVER tried this.

-d/f+1 (blocked), Hn'T
: I used to do this one back in the day. HAS TO BE DONE REALLY FAST. The only
thing that will save you on this is a whole lot of D/F+1, D/F+1 shadow baiting
and the fear of it coming out of nowhere. IT CAN BE DONE. But I just haven't
done it in a while... I'm to scared of Jin.

-Launcher, AOP, f+1+2, Hn'T
: If they tech the launcher the forward roll will go passed them.
Yay Hop N Throw! But this thing is so rare I don't use it unless I'm messing
around.

-*Downed Opponent* u/f, n+[1] *hop over), Hn't
: This is a hop over setup for the hop n throw. Sounds redundant, but it is really
cool if you manage to pull it off!



I2. Openings
------------

      The opening of the round is THE most important time in a round. Especially
for Ling. Most of her game is momentum, momentum, momentum. NOT DAMAGE. This is
why a scrubby Scrapper Jin can't play Ling, because they are too stupid to 
understand why anyone would want to do this!! Using some of these openings, I can
take away half of a person's life before they get their momentum back. When that 
happens, TURTLE jab. This is how to win with Ling. BUT IT ALL STARTS WITH THE
OPENING. Not kidding here people.
      Good news. Most people fear Ling and subconsiously think she has poor 
recovery. Ergo, they'll let you go first. Only the HARDENED tekkies will try
something in the openning seconds versus Ling, and 90% of the time it is guessing
anyway. Keep in mind that her jabs aren't the highest priority in the game...

-SSR, B+3+4
: God knows how many scrubs open up their match with a crouch punch or a 1,2.
They're good but they can be side stepped. SSR walk in the beginning of the 'go'
time and then do a quick sidestep in to rain dance and it will avoid most jabs
(Jin's 2,1 Law's 1,2,3 excluded). This can go in to a throw, a hop kick, a jab
(RDS 2), or a crouch punch that hits low. Not my favorite opening, but damn near
the most basic.

-d/f... D/F+1
: DEFENSE. This is if you are a turtle and don't want to get caught up in anything
nasty. Ok, that's fine. I do this against anybody good who isn't playing Jin. If I'm
facing Jin I'll just used the D/F+1 straight out. The first d/f is for a crouch punch
parry. Most people will do this fearing Ling's AOP. Parry. If you get the parry,
launch them. The D/F+1 is to cover your ass.

-AOP DROP!!
: This is the scariest thing on earth to most people. People just stare at this and
get punished. Even inexperienced Jin players (they watch for it and hop kick. Paul
has his own stuff). From here, 4~3, 1, or u+3 work fine. I use this mostly to scare
the other guy! People WON'T block the 4~3. I swear to god. They're just so afraid
of Ling's mids. BTW, rule of thumb: Block low AOP (interrupt Jin, Paul), 
interrupt RD, block mid normally (AGAINST LING).

-AOP DROP MEGA MADNESS!!!
: If you pull this off, you've already won. AOP DROP to AOP hop to AOP to AOP 4~3.
90% of the time they'll just watch the pretty colors. AOP drop to hop neutral 4
works fairly well too, and it's safer. AOP Drop to hop to AOP to RD to Hn'T...
man... they just may as well give you fifty cents. "She's toooooo goooooooood".

-Hop Over
: Don't do this if the other person is comfortable with it. You'll know if they
are. When the match starts, just jump over the other guy. Usually you can get 
alot of RD stuff. I've caught RD 2,1,4 a fair amount. RD 4 is better IMHO.
RD f+3 is the best if they jabbed under you (experinced players can avoid this
move by crouch away... but that's ok since you shouldn't get away with the hop
over against experienced players).

-1, D+2
: I swear to god, aside from Jin's 2,1 start... this is magnificent. THIS MOVE 
WILL CATCH DAMN NEAR ANYTHING. It will catch hop overs, catch side steppers, 
and some jabbers. Do not use this against Steve. *Or Brian.

-Hypnotist/ Hypnotist walk
: Start this out of jab range. If they try anything, spin sticker. If they
turtle (but you know they're going to start something): 1,2. If you KNOW 
they are to afraid to move, throw them. USE THIS AT LONG RANGE.

-Hop Over Kick
: This will sometimes work. Ling does a U/F, N, 4 and it will hit and Ling
will come out the other side with frame advantage, back to back with the 
other dude. Total ownage. I learned this one from Junior but it's been
around FOREVER.

-SS+4
:If you're JUST BARELY outside of jab range, this is the way to go. This
can lead in to your mix up game real easy. Great way to do damage.


I3. Other Neato Stuff
---------------------

      I only know a limited number of neato things. So don't expect too much
if you are an advanced player. But hey! It just might work...

-Running at a pillar
: Works with any character. If there is a pillar in between you and the opponent,
run at it. You'll keep running even though the pillar is stopping you. If the 
opponent does anything to break the pillar or step around it, BAM! Shoulder charge.

- Spinner Away (b~n+3+4)
: The easiest way to do the spinner away is after another move. It is just BARELY 
after the next move input starts again. Works great after d/f+1 (d/f+1, RD b~n+3+4),
and AOP b+3+4. Also works after a back spinner starter from neutral 
(d/f_d/b,n,d+3+4, RD b~n+3+4). For extra MADNESS, throw in a taunt in between 
spinners, the timing of it helps out alot (spinner, 2+3+4~spinner). It also CAN 
work after the cali roll or B+3+4, but why would you want to do it there?
--Catlord's Spinner Away (SS,d/f,d+3+4)
: Same thing as a neutral backspinner. It is a bit easier to time and there is
an added sidestep. Really there is no difference, but you should know both methods.


-Wall infinites
: This is in general for most characters. I am not skillful enough to do the
infinite with Ling yet, but I can with other characters (Lee, Law, Hwoarang).
IMO, they're cheap, don't ever use them in a serious match. It's not cool. But
here are some of the easies
-- Juggle against the pillars. Works in Garage mostly. Juggle them and keep
hitting them against the pillar. They'll never hit the pillar! I hear it works
in statue as well. THIS ONE HAS NO SKILL.
-- Juggle, SS, 2: This is the second easiest way (btw, this is on Arena).
Do a leve 1-2 juggle (Like Hwoarang's sky rocket. Ling has one AOP D+1+2, but I 
don't know if it works). Sidestep while they are in the air so that they are in
between you and the wall. Punch them. If they hit the wall so that it looks
like their side aches, you did it right. Then, do some combo that carries
them over to the next wall. This is easy with Law, Lee, and Hwoarang... but
damned if I know how to do it with Ling. As Lil Twin (Dom). He'll know if anyone.

-Running Dive in to a juggle
: If you do a running dive (f,f,F... 1+2) and it hits them late in the dive, you
can get a free juggle. This is true for anyone.

-Fox Step
: WAY TO DAMN HARD WITH LING. But here it is: B+3+4~f~n,f. Big thanks to Dom
for this one. Ultra flashy Ling. 
Side note with Hwoarang: Fox step with f,f... f,f~b does left moves like 3~4
which can lead in to more fox step madness.

-Shadow step
:WORKS FOR EVERYONE BUT LING (and maybe Lei now that I think about it). While
back turned, d~d/b~d~d/b... as fast as you can. Like Law's slide in the other
direction.

-d/f+2
: d/f+2 launches from the back. It's not terrible when the opponent is lying
face up head towards. Ling can do two in a row and it will sometimes catch.

-RD AOP
:f,f+3, d+1+2 will get you there. This will put Ling in to RD AOP... but it 
only last for a few seconds. You do RD moves from this position, not AOP.

-Dom's Wall Trick
: Wall push, 1,2, AOP drop~u (AOP cancel), Wall push. The timing on this is 
so sick. People just get nailed by this always. And the mix up is NASTY!!!!

-WEIRDGONZO's d+3 trick
: d+3 is an interesting move. Frames allow Ling a near free throw opportunity,
(I think you can still duck it. I'll have to ask her). My variation is, 
"HOW MANY D+3 CAN HIT YOU BEFORE YOU BLOCK LOW?" I'll just keep d+3 and switch
up to a d/f+2~1 on the third hit or something.

-Taunt 2+3+4
: A launcher is guaranteed off of this taunt. But I think I said that somewhere
in this thing... Of course, this is good for damn near anything. Wall push, jab,
another taunt. BTW, two taunts in a row is MAD SKILLS.

-Ling's Just Frame
: Just kidding. Although AOP U,n+3,d+1+2 comes close.

-AOP U,n+3, d+1+2 instant recovery
: After this move there is NO RECOVERY... any move can be input from AOP. There
are a few applications for confusion and otherwise. Too bad the piruotte kick
is such a lousy move. Example: AOP U,n+3, d+1+2~ AOP 4~3 

-Taunt Walk
: 1+3+4~f~1+3+4~f...  and remember to buffer like a mad man. Not exactly a snake
dash but hey, take what you get.

-The Tornado!
: I saw Kenbou doing it at TiT5. d+1+2, b+3+4, d+1+2... and mix up after. I 
think I mentioned this too somewhere in here. Just thought I'd say it again.
You can buffer the back and the down, like this [d]+1+2, [D/B]+3+4, [D/B]+1+2,
[D/B]+3+4... but I think I covered that too. The mix up (if I remember right)
was a RD crouch cancel to WS+4 or RD d+1 or AOP 1 or AOP 4~3.

-MAD LING JUGGLE
:AOP u,n+3, d+1+2~b+3+4, RD 4 juggles

-Shauno Loves The d/b+1
: Ok. I don't use this move nearly at all. But Shauno (a very good Ling player),
uses it all the time. Recovery is awesome, damage is awesome, range is awesome,
but it just takes forever to come out. Especially against jabbers. 
But throw it in there. Shauno loves it for a reason. (P.S. love this move 
around walls).

-RD d+4
: Contrary to Tekken Tag, the RD d+4 is now just as good as d/b+3 from neutral.
This is actually fairly good news. Now people can bait the XMTS (f,f+1+2) from
RD d+4 as well. But I just keep forgeting to use it.

-Punish Moves Already!
: One of my biggest problems. I don't punish blocked mid moves at all. I'd
rather rely on a pair of jabs to get my momentum up again to go in to Ling's
mix-up game. However, 3 and d/b+1 can be used alot of the time to punish. 
For example, d/b+1 is guaranteed after a blocked Paul's WS+2 and a 3 is
guaranteed after Paul's d+1+2 (3 combos in to 4~3)

-Shauno's 'Number 49' special
: The reason why this is called Shauno's 'Number 49' special, is because
he used this setup to defeat me the 49th time I played him. The setup
goes something like this... Wall Push, 1, D+2, d/f+3. If the opponent
tries to crouch punch (common), he will stagger back. But since there is a
wall there, it is a free d/b+1 (wall stun). I tell you... never underestime
the great ones.

-The Wall Stun Combo
: It is possible to get out of this combo, but people generally won't do it
on reaction. d/b+1 (wall stun), u/f+4, 4~3.

-The b+4 Wall Push Psych Out
: Something I've been working on. Wall push, B+2, B+2, wall push. Trust me,
he'll block high the third time.

-The d/f+2 launch setup
: d/f+2+4, d/f+2   or   RD 4 (BT opponent), d/f+2. It will juggle if they do 
an instant stand up. This is another trick of mine. I haven't seen other 
people doing this one. Hey, if it is mine, I deserve a cookie!

-The f,f+3 delay
: I forgot for the life of me who brought this to my attention. I think it was
Adrian (Aussie) but I can't be sure. f,f+3 can also be f,f,n+3. Not much in
the way of setups (too slow), but it is something to keep in mind.

-Parry Wrong Way
: While in rain dance, f+2+4. Ling will parry the wrong way. Just a glitch.

-While parallel to walls...
: ... these combos will work. U/F+3, d+1+2, AOP 2>1   and 3, f,f,3, RD 2,
RD f+3. That last one will sometimes go in to infinites.

-The Royal Court's "u/f, n+1" trick
: U/F,... n +1 is actually fairly good okizeme. Works with any character.

-Nall-Ohki's Parry Tactic
: This is a TTT tactic that surprisingly works in T4. Ling does have a standing
parry in T4 (1+4) but I NEVER use this move. Recently I fought against Nall
and he used this move somewhat frequently. I was surprised at its effectiveness.
Nothing is garaunteed after a parry, but it is a great way to destroy the
opponents momentum. There really isn't a great frame advantage, but more often
than not the opponent will turtle after a parry simply out of unfamiliarity.
This is a great opportunity for mixup.

-Dom's "I DEMAND YOU PUT THIS IN YOUR FAQ" Wall Trick
Wall Push 1,d+2, df~df~df~Wall push, 1, df+3
: The wall push 1,d+2 stuff is the starter. The df~ string is to get the
opponent to duck on the next go round. The second wall push is the second
startup. The left jab is to piss them off in to ducking. And finally the
d/f+3 is to cause the stutter back stun which can lead in to another d/b+1
or something else to your fancy. Dom specifically demanded that I put this
in here :)


I4. Getting Out Of The Cheapness
--------------------------------

      Shauno included something like this on the TZ site in the strat forums.
I think it is pertinent to put some of the stuff that he said in here, along
with some other things that may not be quite as effective, but alot easier.

-Jin's Scraper
: Most of us have been through it. Every tournament, every arcade, every no
good punk thinks he can play Jin when he nails the JF scraper. It's easier
with Ling that with others to get out of this move.
--Sidestep versus retaliation. When the second hit is blocked (assuming the 
first hit is also blocked), immediately SSR. If they try the JF (even the 
quick one), it's a free back throw with Ling. This works as long as they don't 
do the quick scraper (no unblockable)... which can be retaliated against. If
they do the quick scraper and it is blocked, it is a free f+3 which means 
another free 4~3. This should take away alot of Jin's scraper game, and may
make them very afraid of it.
--b+1. This is something that I NEED TO TRAIN MYSELF TO DO. Normally, I
sidestep, which isn't the best. B+1 is the best. Let's say you get hit
by the first two hits of the scraper, or let's say Ling is near a wall.
It is damn near impossible to sidestep. This is where b+1 comes in. It 
works about the same way as the sidestep, except that it will work even
if the first two hit or near a wall. Again, this won't work against
quick scrapers.
--AOP anticipation. If you anticipate the scrapers, go in to AOP. The first
two hits of the scraper will miss, and Ling has a free AOP u+3 opportunity
in between the 2nd and 3rd hit. AOP works very well against Jin if Ling
IMMEDIATELY does some AOP move right after she goes in to it.

-Nina's Ivory Cutter (1+4)
: Nina scrubs favorite move. Forces crouching on opponents, mixup
afterwards, and most importantly to a scrub... safe and repeatable. The
easiest ways to get out of this move involve knowing your opponent and
what they will do.
--Nina does a 1+4, no sidestep, blocked. Ling can do a WS+1
(quick uppercut) to interrupt. But generally you'll see the sidestep.
--1+4, blocked, SS. Depending on which way she sidesteps, Ling can
get a WS+1_WS+2. WS+1 tracks left and WS+2 tracks right. Just have
to see which way she moves. This tactics works well for any character
and nearly every move that forces crouching.
--1+4 hit. Dear Jesus. Know your opponent. Throw, 1+4, jabs, trips,
sidestep. Nina can go in to anything after this. Just predict what 
they are going to try.

-Lee's SS+2
: Lee's god move. After this connects, mist step 1,2,4 is guaranteed.
If it is blocked, he can just do another one with little threat of 
retaliation. Well...
--AOP. Ling has a wonderful move that will avoid it. Advanced players
will expect this from her, so be careful. A quick AOP drop to a 2,1
works according to Shauno. Personally I like the AOP trip (AOP 4~3).
This move tracks very well, and is somewhat quick.

-Law's 1,2,3
:God damn. I know some people who use this move over and over and
end up winning. For the love of god, if you are a Law player...
learn DDS.
--Crouch Punch or not to crouch punch. If someone does this move
over and over, Ling can interrupt with a crouch punch or AOP drop
AOP 1. But alot of Law players expect this, so they will try to 
parry or crouch punch. So here's the game: crouch punch when
they won't parry. Back off when they think you'll crouch punch.
Granted this takes a bit of mind reading, but the damage won't
be terrible.
--D/F+1 can preemptively prevent this string (it avoids jabs).

-Marduk's d+4
: This has killed me in a few matches. God damn. Unparryable, low
quick, and hard to retaliate against. That is, unless you are Ling.
--Block. Most people can not retaliate against Marduk's d+4, but
Ling fortunately can. On a block, WS+4 is guaranteed. Thank god.
--DO NOT CROUCH PUNCH. D+4 recovers neutral. Which means Marduk
can do all of his anti punch stuff (D/B+1+2_D+1+2). So don't
crouch punch.
--Keep on the pressure. Marduk can not do this move if Ling is
in his face. Range 1-0, Ling owns Marduk. Just keep jabbing
--SS. SSR will avoid this move. Although I think this is hard
to see coming. But... Marduk doesn't have alot of stuff that
tracks on his left (SSR for you).



I5. Ling Player Descriptions
----------------------------

***Avarus the Lingmassacre***
   What description shall I provide for my own Ling? Hmmm...
I would say more often than not my Ling fights very linearly.
It has been a long time since I played TTT Ling so my tactics
rely more on jabs and confusion than the super-sidestep tactics
of the TTT age.
   My main style is a mixture of fast low pokes and heavy damage
confusion setups. I don't do parry baiting as much as I should,
which is really a shame. I rely on certain strings for garaunteed
damage when I need it (1,D+2, d+4), for example when the opponent
is low on life. Starting out a match I use D/F+1 alot to get an
idea of my opponent. The middle of my match is when I look for
confusion setups.
   My wall game is secondary, but not terrible. My favorite is
(1, D+2, AOP, AOP cancel, wall push). Generally I will stay away
from the wall unless I find myself in an greatly advantageous 
position.
   I like range 3 better than I like range 1. It's odd for a Ling
player but it's true. It's my belief that Ling's range 3 is on
par with the Mishimas crouch dash tactics. But that's just me.
The XMTS is a great distance move along with f,f+3.
   My AOP is sorely misused. I use it for low pokes. And generally
for unsafe low pokes. My line of thinking is that people do not block
low against Ling out of fear for her mids. So I abuse the low moves
out of AOP (AOP f+4  AOP 3~4). I use AOP u/f+3 only when I think
it will work. When it doesn't work I immediately follow with a 4
so the notation is AOP u/f+3,4.
   I LOVE using the hop n' throw. More acurately I like doing things
differently. When I am on my game sometimes I will simply run up
to a person, go in to AOP, AOP hop, AOP -> RD, RD spinner away. IT
DOES NO DAMAGE BUT GOD IT LOOKS COOL! In the last tournament my
opponent had next to no life left. I taunted and waited for them
to charge. When the were close enough I did a simple left jab to
kill them.   STYLE IS IMPORTANT!
   I also use alot of retreating tactics. AOP hop retreat and the
RD spinner retreats are my favorite. I move in and out of ranges
very easily.
   I get afraid in tournament play. I play VERY conservatively when
I am afraid. IT'S A VERY BAD THING FOR ME TO DO THAT. I play much
better when I am reckless.


***Shauno***
   The original Ling master. Imagine Babe Ruth coming back from the
dead to play baseball. That's this guy. He hasn't played T4 in years
and he still can beat me with gusto.
   A solid player all round. Very intimate knowledge of the game with
setups that have never been seen before. Not so much an unsafe player
as he is psychic. Shauno has been known for his ability to read the
other player's mind. Really a nice guy in person and quite the 
gentleman. He's a family man too... I think his youngest daughter is
2-3 years old by now.
   This man loves the wall. Shauno is a supporter of Ling's d/b+1 and
wall stun combos. Known specifically for the 'Shauno Special'
(d/b+1 *wall stun*, u/f+4, 4~3). Loves the stun taunt with Ling in wall
setups. ... Just a lot of smooth technical ability around walls.
   Shauno is aggressive but not so much with jabs. He does have a
tendency to fight linearly, using sidestep at range 3 or range 1 as a
part of a setup. He likes the 4~3 to SSL.
   Shauno's ability lies in his strong knowledge of the game, psychic
ability, relatively safe tactics, and experience. Even today he is
considered (or should be) the 2nd best Ling player in the US.
   He's since moved on to SCII (and a fairly decent Talim). You can
still see him walking around the big tournaments in LA. You can
identify him by the Lakers shirt/hat.


***Weirdgonzo***
   Perhaps the best female player on earth. Definately the best female
Ling player. She's a member of the San Diego crew and wife of USMCogre.
A huge amount of player vs. player experience against a number of
different characters. Sadly her experience Ling versus Ling is somewhat
limited due to the fact that she is the ONLY established Ling player in
southern California.
   My impression of her style is counter-jab. She drops in to AOP alot
and immediately comes up with AOP u/f+3. Fairly damaging combos after
a launcher with a decent amount of okizeme.
   I recall that she liked staying range 2 ish and
SS'ing for SS+4 poking. Also I think she tends towards poke more than
use setups. But I could be just talking out my asshole. My memory has
somewhat faded since I faced her last. I should be facing her again at
Evo so more details then.


***Nall-Ohki***
   One of the greats at TTT Ling. Recently came back from the US after
a tour in Japan's arcade scene. Oddly enough he is the only T4 Ling
I've seen that plays like a TTT Ling. From a T4 standpoint his style
of play is unorthodox, but really it's a TTT Ling! If you look at the
TTT FAQ section you'll see his Ling FAQ. In fact this FAQ borrowed
a tiny bit of fundamental theory on Nall's FAQ.
   The prime trait of a TTT Ling is the guts to triple sidestep at
range 0. Most people have given up Ling's sidestep game in T4 but
Nall still uses it with gusto.
   Personally I think he is a master of Ling's standing parry (1+4) and
the great wall (b+1_b+2). He uses the parry as a way to interrupt the
opponent's momentum. I've learned (firsthand) that when Nall parries his
opponent then the opponent tends to turtle. Perfect for Ling's pitbull
nature.
   Nall uses a bit of parry baiting, or at least more than I do. Not
quite on the order of his royal chetness' low parrying ability but 
still very respectable.
   His Ling is the only non-linear Ling I've ever seen in T4. His
sidesteps are fearless! FEARLESS!
   Nall's strength is in his TTT Ling an not his T4 Ling sadly enough.
But there is more than enough talent to be a force in any T4 tournament.
   He's a nice guy too. I like his stories on Japan. Plus I got to see
Battle Royale thanks to him!



   These are the only Ling players I've played against. If I ever play
Dom or Kenbou or any of the other great Lings out there I will be
sure to let you know how they play.
   This section is not meant to give away people's tricks and talents.
This section is meant to show you that there are several ways of playing
Ling at an expert level. You'll notice that I really didn't tell you
their specific setups or strings to watch out for. That would be a bit
more information than I would like to give on these players without
their permission.




J. COMBOS
#########

      My combo section will be very basic. In my opinion, a character only needs two 
good juggles from every launcher. One that does the most damage, and one that sets up 
for the best okizeme. Any more combos that I put will be for variety.

One side note... I like using combos off of the cross lifting palms that carry them 
a long distance. Here's why. The launcher to turn them so they are facing the wall,
WHICH IS KILLER! They can't tech off of a wall when they are facing it. The more
distance a combo covers, the more likely it is to hit a wall. When the do hit a
wall, demon flip (4~3). Another advanced thing to try after that would be SS d/b+3,
1,d+2,1+2.

      Those are all the combos Ling will ever need. There are some more combos, even 
combos that do more damage. However, they are harder to time and input. If there is 
some great compelling interesting to learn them, they are available at Tekken Zaibatsu. 
They're nice to know to keep the game interesting. There are even more tricks, but that 
has to do with okizeme, not combos. Check out the set-up section.





K. BEATING LING
###############

      Maybe some of you are asking at this point, "how on earth do I defeat Ling?"
Well, this FAQ wouldn't be quite complete unless I covered this section just a little
bit. But this doesn't meant that I can't hope some of you non-Ling players out there
don't read this. Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha.

-Do Not Fear Ling
: Ling players love the smell of fear. It is a guaranteed win for us! The key to
beating Ling is not to fear. Fight fire with fire. Force Ling to turtle. From that
point, you've basically weeded out half the Ling players out there.
      Know her moves. If your character has a good parry defense, it's the worst 
thing that a Ling player has to go through, because then she can't be an all-out
pitbull anymore! Know which moves do what things and be prepared to parry. Fortunately
for us Ling players, Xiayou has very few strings to rely on... so all of our strings
are customized. Well... I hate to do this but...

-WHEN TO EXPECT A LOW MOVE
: Ling's best offense are her low moves. It is not that they do the most damage, but
they are the moves that are the most annoying to deal with. They are also her weakest
chain. Attack her here and she'll have some problems. Expect a low move after these
strings, and be sure to parry-counter.
-1,d+2
-RD d+1
-1,2     *I do this alot, I don't know about other people... 1,2, d+4*
-D/F+1   *My friend does this, D/F+1, d+4*
-SS+4    *The best thing to follow up an SS+4 with is an SS+4*

-AOP
: One of the best thing any Ling player can abuse, especially in T4. Alright, first
thing to cover. AS SOON AS LING GOES IN TO AOP, THERE IS A SLIGHT SSR. This alone
causes people the most trouble. Because AOP can actually evade alot of things that
would normally hit AOP (if d+1+2 is executed at the exact same time as the opponent's
move). Get around this by knowing what moves kill AOP. I'll help.
-Paul
d+1, d/f+1, d+1+2, SS+3
-Heihachi
(d/f+1,2), d+1
-Kazuya
(d/f+1,2)
-Nina
f+1+2
-Ling
(f,f+1+2,1+2)
-Jin
d/f+1
P.S. There are plenty of other moves that get Ling out of AOP, but these are the ones
that people should use the most often. Safe, reliable, and damaging.

-Know Her Setups
: Better yet, train yourself day and night to counter her setups. I swear to god, I've
been playing Ling for some time now, and I'll still fall for her setups. EVEN ONES THAT
I USE MYSELF! I still crouch punch after Ling's kangaroo kick (WHICH IS A NO-NO). Read
the setups section to familiarize yourself with her nasty little tricks. Then have a
friend try them out on you.

-Sidestep
: LING FIGHTS LINEARLY. She can only attack and defend in a near straight line. In 
order to change things up a bit, she has a few sidestep moves (that can be countered
by jabs, all of them). She's weak on her right side, so SSL ALOT AGAINST HER. I'm not
kidding. I hate people who SS alot, because Ling doesn't have moves that safe and
track well. She really doesn't
-Paul Players!
I see USMCogre doing this alot. Probably because his wife is a Ling player. SS+3,
SS-deathfist mixup gives Ling players nightmares. P.S. If you know who this person
is, drop him a line. His name is Jason. He just got back from Iraq, and wants to
wreak havoc on the Vegas players. Oh dear.

-Ling's Okizeme
: Believe me when I tell you that it is NOT Ling's setups that do the most damge.
Well, not exactly. It's her okizeme (ground fighting). When the opponent is on the
ground is when Ling has the most options. She has momentum, she has you at a 
disadvantage. She has plenty of moves that can hit you on the ground, plenty of
moves to her you when you get up. My suggestion, is to do one of either two things:
-extended tech roll, roll away (while grounded D+1, b)
: If Ling is far away (range 2-3), do this. The only weapons she has from here are
f,f+3 (which will knock you away when tech rolling) and 4~3 (which won't hit if you
are tech rolling).
: If Ling is a bit closer, she has some options. Range 0, stay on the ground, wait
for a second, then extended tech roll and roll away. Range 1... same thing. Range
1-2 gets tricky, cause now she is in prime 4~3 distance. Do an immediate stand. 
If Ling runs close to you, JAB! Or block and watch out for a throw.
: Off of a juggle, WATCH LING CLOSELY. If it was a RD juggle and she cali rolls
afterwards, you can do one of two things. One, stay on the ground... you'll
probably take a peg leg, but it doesn't take much damage. Two, IMMEDIATELY
GET UP AND SSR. Alot of her okizeme will miss if you sidestep and poof... launcher.
: And a final note of caution. IF YOU ARE FACING A REALLY GOOD LING PLAYER (I'm 
talking 7-8 people in the United States), KICK-TECH ROLL. Alot of the tech catches
Ling has are meant for punch tech rolls. Not to say Ling doesn't have a kick-tech 
roll catch, it's just that no one uses it. So if you are facing a really good 
player, and you are afraid of tech catches, push kick AS SOON AS YOU LAND.





L. TOURNAMENTS
##############

      Most of the people reading this guide have probably already been to at least
one tournament in their life, be it tekken or not. Tekken tournamnets are not much
different than any other tournaments. There is a certain amount of manners and
respect expected to be maintained. There is also alot of fun to be had, as long
as you know what to expect. I thought I'd include this in here just so people
might have an idea of what one of these tournies is like. Not many FAQ's touch
on this subject at all.

      The most important thing at a tourney is fun, not winning. As long as I've
been playing this game, I still haven't won a respectable tournament (got second
though). Winning is secondary, unless you are one of four people in this country.
Tournaments are a great place to learn new things. They are like a giant forum 
of new moves and techniques. They are also a fun place to meet new people.
I've made a few friends just by going to these things, and there is a wonderful
feeling when they remember you at the next tournament.

      A few things to remember. Bring your own stick/controller, or plan out 
ahead of time whose you are going to use. Most tournaments do not provide the
pads for people to play on. Be respectful of others. Don't walk infront of 
the screen while people are playing (wait for the end of the rounds). Don't
take flash pictures head on with people playing. Don't get personal with
trash talk.

      Try to hook up housing arrangements with someone. If this is your first 
tourney out of town, I would suggest a hotel until you get to know some people.
Housing is one of the funnest parts of a tourney. It's like an all night tekken
fest. And you get to know alot more people this way. Plus it's a free night's 
room. I would suggest that you bring your own pillow and blanket in a backpack
or something. Be prepared to sleep on the floor, or not to sleep at all. Most 
commonly, people get 2-3 hours sleep with these things (if that).

      At the end of the match, shake hands with the guy. If you feel like 
crying, there should be a bathroom nearby. If you win, it is your 
responsibility to let the tournament keeper know. During a match it is ok
to have people root for you, but playing tips from your friends is generally
looked down upon. And please, if you win a match, don't talk about it infront
of the person you just beat. I know this one guy with little tournament 
experience. He beats a respectable player in a tournament with Jin. 
Afterwards he says something like, "Wow dude! That was bad! I've never played
Jin before." and laughs while the person who lost was standing right there.

      Gameplay is anything goes. You have a score to settle, you settle it during
the match. Taunting is good. A well executed combo is fine. But keep in mind
respect. If you LS with Jin all day, no one is going to pay much attention to
you. Infinites, although requiring a great amount of skill, will not earn a 
whole lot of respect. End the infinite if you manage to land one, it's 
courtesy. Also, don't give out tips to the other person while you are playing,
that's not to nice as well. Landing new tricks during gameplay, however, is
fun.

      Have fun at tourneys. Learn some new tricks. Get in some competition.
After a tourney, a bunch of people go out to eat. This is actually the best
time I've had at any tourney. People eat, they talk about the day. What 
they saw, what they liked, whom they beat, who sucks, who doesn't, etc.
If the people at the tournament liked your gameplay, you can get in on alot
more conversation. God those are fun!

P.S. If you ever get a ride with the AZ crew, remember. It's just jelly.



L*. A QUICK NOTE ABOUT EVO2K3
#############################
     
     Maddogjin, one of the greatest Jin players in the world, beaten. The 
Texans, taking the glory at this tournament. Jinkid #1 is an awesome
achievement. Just so you know, Americans have never won an Evo in Tekken
before this. Maddogjin, was taken out of the tournament by Jinkid and
Dom. Dom is a Ling player. Coincidentally I should tell you that Jinkid
is really weak against Ling.
     I am not one of the great Ling players. Not even in the US. I'm just
a name for a few people. But I came ONE RIGHT LOW KICK AWAY FROM PUTTING
JINKID IN THE LOSERS BRACKET. To boot, I beat his Jin! He picked Paul to
beat me! I faced him first round, and I lost by ONE RIGHT LOW KICK. But,
back to what is poignant.
     EVO2k3, a proving ground for Ling. Even though Jinkid won it, Ling
proved herself a viable character in the eyes of all.


M. Frequently Asked Questions
#############################

     Kinda ironic that I have to include a FAQ section in a FAQ. but
I have been getting these questions for a while now and I don't know
where else to answer these questions. So, to begin...



M1. Flash Versus Anti-Flash
---------------------------

     Flashy Ling and Anti-Flashy Ling: what's the difference? Which one should you
use? Why is it important?
     Flashy Lings are Lings that use a huge amount of set-ups, confusion tactics,
baiting, cancelling, etc. It is a style that I prefer to use (but don't always end
up using). Flashy Lings can do a lot of damage in a short amount of time but takes
a lot of risks in doing so. If you can manage to use Ling without making mistakes,
this is the style for you. Also a good style against people who don't normally play
Ling. When they see all the crazy stuff she can do they are most likely to block. AND
AS SOON AS ANYONE STARTS BLOCKING AGAINST LING THEY ARE DEAD.
     Anti-Flash Lings are Lings that prefer to poke and sidestep. This style is good
if you like to use a more defensive style. EVEN THOUGH I PREFER TO USE FLASHY LING
STYLE, I REVERT BACK TO ANTI-FLASH IN COMPETITION. Which really sucks because my
flashy Ling is so much better. An example would be 1,2, d+4. High high low. Small
amounts of damage continuously. D/F+1 is your best friend when you are an anti-flash
Ling. I'M NOT saying that anti-flashy Lings can't do a lot of damage, just that they
won't use moves like d/b+1 or RD 4 unless it is completely safe.
     You may be asking. Why do you revert to anti-flash Ling when you prefer a flashy
Ling? Well... Ling is kinda funny that way. She is so versatile she almost is hard to
control. Even if I want to do flashy Ling, she just tends to fight the way that I feel.
If I am nervous (like in a tournament) I will revert to the safe poking Ling. If I am
having a fun time with friends, flashy Ling all the way. If you are good enough to flow
in and out of both styles at will, super. My suggestion is that one tends towards
flashy Ling in the beginning of a match to an anti-flash Ling at the end of a match.


M2. Stick Versus Pad
--------------------

     Which one should you use? Wellll.... I use pad. Ling is a character that can not
take advantage of the intricate movements a stick can provide. Plus Ling has many moves
that if not input correctly can come out as moves with TERRIBLE recovery time. The 
difference between f+3 and f,f+3 is HUGE and it is important that when you use one
that you do not accidentally use the other. Pad has more control over directions than
stick does... so that's why I use pad.
     Stick players flaunt the excellent control of a stick. Detailed movements and timing
are essential when playing on a stick. If you master a stick then you have more control over
your character then a pad player. NOT SAYING THAT STICK PLAYERS ARE BETTER! Many good US
players play on pad simply because they feel more comfortable that way.
     I think choosing stick versus pad is a matter of what character you are playing and how
you feel playing that character.
     Characters I think should be used on pad: Ling, Steve, Marduk, Christie, Julia
     Characters I think should be used on stick: Nina, Kaz, Hei, Law


M3. Shoulder Buttons
--------------------

     Can you use shoulder buttons in tournaments? You can get away with it if you talk to
the dude who is running the tournament... but I will tell you right now that YOU SHOULD
NOT USE SHOULDER BUTTONS!!!!!!!! There is no reason why one needs to be dependent on shoulder
buttons. Using shoulder buttons immediately labels you as a rookie (not that you are a rookie,
you just look like one).
     You can get around using shoulder buttons by button buffering. I added a section on this
in this revision (E1*).
     I REPEAT! YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE SHOULDER BUTTONS! YOU SHOULD LEARN NOT TO USE SHOULDER
BUTTONS!


M4. How to Hold a Controller
----------------------------

     Most people figure this out eventually but I shall give it away to those who have not
yet realized its brilliance. I call it 'snake-fang' style. Gives it a nice cantonese kung-fu
feel to it. The left hand stays the same, the right (button hand) is different. Hold the
controller with your pinkie, ring finger, and thumb. Use your index and middle finger to
push buttons. This is superior to the  'thumb only' approach because this way you can
easily push more than one button at a time. In fact it is even possible to buffer with
three buttons. Anyways, I have said my piece.





N. ABOUT THE AUTHOR
###################

      Why on earth should anyone believe what I am saying?!?!?! Well, you shouldn't. 
Test what I've said for yourself. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. If it does work, 
hurrah! No one has to believe anything I've said based on who I am. But just in case 
anyone is curious...
      I have been playing Tekken for 6 years now. My original arcade was Orchid Bowl in 
Santa Barbara, CA. The local arcade shark there (Whose initials are ABC) would kick my 
butt nearly every time I played him. I practiced in order to get better (I hate losing), 
and it just continued from there.
      Two years ago, I moved to Las Vegas, NV. And then up to Reno. 
Since then, I've been competing on a national level. I've been fortunate enough 
to play some of the country's greatest tekkenites. Granted, I'm nothing special, 
but I can hold my own. I've competed at EC3, EC4, EC5 (Los Angeles) and TiT4, TiT 5 (Dallas), 
and have attended the National T4 Tournament (Las Vegas).
      I've been a Ling player for 6 years now, and I consider her my best character. 
I have achieved a moderate ability with every character, and an expert ability with 
about 4. At TTT my main characters are Xiaoyu, Law, Gunjack, Yoshi, Julia, and Hwoarang. 
At Tekken 4: Ling, Steve, and Law.
      And there you have it.
