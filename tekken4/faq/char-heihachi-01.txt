[ ]::[AUTHOR'S NOTES]::[ ]

  Since no one has posted ANYTHING to do with Heihachi... and I can't seem to get
myself into the forums... I have decided to compose my OWN strategy guide. This
is BY NO MEANS an Heihachi Bible or anything meant to resemble one. So DON'T
BLAME me if you have any disagreements with any of the content. Remember, this
is my first FAQ, it's here because none of YOU have made any effort to author
one, and quite frankly, I don't care.

[i]::[VERSION HISTORY]::[i]

  What history??? This is the first one... and don't count on me coming out with
a series... I barely have any time to play this friggin game, let alone write a
series of FAQs just for you lazy buggers.



[ii]::[WHY IS THIS HERE?]::[ii]

  As mentioned above... no one has taken the time to compose a decent HEIHACHI
MISHIMA STRAT GUIDE.  Even when I took the time to check out the TEKKEN ZAIBATSU 
FORUMS I was a little... no, a lot... disconcerted with the amount of HEIHACHI 
bashing that was going on. To tell you the truth I almost fell for half the crap 
that was being posted... comments regarding his old moves modified (hell sweep) 
no more tile splitter<deathfist blah blah blah.  So what?  Cry me a river. Any 
decent Tekken-er knows not to rely on only a coupla moves... Sure we all have 
our favorites, but hey, we have to make due with what's available to us... right?
Yeah... that's right... life ISN'T fair!



[iii]::[HEIHACHI MISHIMA PROFILE (Tekken Zaibatsu)]::[iii]

Country of origin  : Japan (although the Japanese government denies it)
Fighting Style     : Mishima Ryu Ken
Age                : 75?


:: history (T4)::

Two years ago, HEIHACHI failed to capture Ogre. He made his researchers collect
blood and tissue left behind by Ogre and attempted to create a new life form by
combining its genetic material with his own. The experiment failed, however, and
HEIHACHI learned that he lacked the Devil Gene necessary to integrate Ogre's 
ginome into his.

In order to obtain the Devil Gene, HEIHACHI searched for Jin, who transformed 
into a devil during the last Tournament. During the search, HEIHACHI learned that 
the body of his son, Kazuya - whom he killed 20 years ago - was stored at a 
cutting-edge biotech firm called G Corporation.

HEIHACHI ordered his Tekken Force to raid G Corporation in an attempt to obtain 
Kazuya's remains. They obliterated G Corporation's laboratory, and the mission
appeared to be successful. ...That was until Kazuya, revived by G Corporation,
retaliated and coused the mission to fail.

HEIHACHI needed Kazuya or Jin's nody to create the new life form. After much
deliberation, an evil smile crept onto HEIHACHI's lips.

The next day, an announcement was made for The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4,
with the Mishima Zaibatsu as the prize.

until I started playing against some Japanese, King user!  He's unreal!  Oh well
that doesn't matter.  Like I said earlier (if I didn't I'm mentioning it now...)
I'm not the greatest player in the world, but I DO consider myself above 
average.  As of so far no one has challenged any of my TIMEATTACK scores... some
people think that TIMEATTACK is boring and takes no skill.  Not true, TIMEATTACK
can be quite challenging and with certain characters pretty fun =).  At the 
arcade I play at I have all the TIME ATTACK SCORES except for Christie which is 
owned by my buddy... 3:14:63 JNX.  Not surprisingly, my HEIHACHI is number 1 at 
2:28:96 KAE.  you can check out my website for the rest of the scores...
http://d4rkwind.tripod.com  anyone is welcome to send in their TIMEATTACK result
provided you include the arcade name, your name, your time, and proof of your
score... eg: digital photo.  I know... there's no proof of my scores, but I know
they're real, and when I get a digicam I'll post the proof too ~_^.

HEIHACHI is generally better for bulldogging (to me, anyway).  Unfortunately, as
of yet, I haven't had the chance to play against any opponents worth playing 
against.  Most of the time I'll beat them under 15 - 20 seconds.  Yeah, I know...
doesn't prove anything **sigh** but it's not my fault there aren't any good 
players around here.  Oh, except for 2... we'll call them 'Lemon face' and uhhh
'Nathan'... yeah. o_o  Since I don't have anything to write... I'll move on to
tell you all how to TRY to beat my time =).  Here we go.

** THIS PARAGRAPH WAS WRITTEN BEFORE I GOT SCHOOLED BY THE JAPANESE GUY (^^; **
**  ok... I have had a chance to play against some KICK A$$ opponents... woah...
I need work on my game play... but... yeah, I do have a life... sorry guys ^_^ **


:: TIME ATTACK ::

There are two ways to begin each round, but before I get into those there is 
something even more important : positioning!!!  If you read any other T4 FAQs
you'll have discovered that positioning BEFORE the round begins may well
determine the outcome of the battle.  PAY ATTENTION to what BACKGROUND you're in!
If you're in one of the enclosed BGs (LAB, PIT) it is possible to KO your 
opponent in 4-6 seconds!  Even if you aren't in a closed space you can average
8-10 seconds yep... TRUE for most other characters too (some easier than others).


Back to the 2 different STARTERS:
  
CHOICE 1: Stay back about 1 bodylength away (you might have to back up, as many
AI fighters tend to rush a la JIN).  When the match starts begin with DEMON BOAR
(b+2) for some reason the computer next-to-never blocks this (???) i don't know 
why.  What's better?... Most of the time they'll try something to counter but 
will fall short resulting in CH.  If this is the case follow up with DIAMOND
LANCE (qcf+2) or DEMON BREATH (1+2).  Generally DEMON BREATH is preffered for it
is easier to execute, follow up with TILE SPLITTER (d+1) for an extra hit on the 
ground. If you don't get CH then follow up with DIAMOND LANCE which, I find, hits
99% of the time.

CHOICE 2: bulldog - stay close.  FIGHT! is 
announced begin with DEMON BREATH (1+2) this move is extraorinarily fast and is
pretty much a 90% hit rate (against the computer off the start).  If it connects
your opponent will either crumble onto your feet or be flung to the ground about
1 body length away.  In either case you can follow up with TILE SPLITTER, in the
latter you'll have to dash closer to connect.

Now that you've knocked your opponent flat on their a$$es you, once again, have
a series of choices...

FIRST:  Get close enough to trick the computer into doing a recovery kick
(kick while getting up)  you can tell when they are going to do this via a 
couple of giveaways:  if they roll sideways and back, if they roll back, or if
they stay on the ground for a bit without doing anything it usually means they
are waiting for you to come in close.  Learn to stay out of range and you can
make them 'whiff' everytime!


AWAY FROM OBSTACLES/WALLS

CHOICE 1: Follow up with DIAMOND LANCE, knocking them flat on their butts once
again.

CHOICE 2: Follow up with DEMON BOAR.  This hit will most DEFINITELY NOT be CH
and should be followed up with one of 2 things: DEMON BREATH just to be safe but 
might be blocked... or DIAMOND LANCE 99% hit rate but harder to execute.

CHOICE 3: Follow up with TGF (f,N,d,d/f+1) or DELAY TGF (f,N,d,D/F+1) into 
DIAMOND HELL AXE (= :d,U+3,4)... latter not recommended (too difficult to 
execute).

CHOICE 4: Follow up with HELL AXE (u/f+3,4).

CHOICE 5: Follow up with DEMON GODFIST (f,f+2) or TWIN PISTONS (d/f+1,2) to
launch opponent.  Next single jab (1) then DEMON TILE SPLITTER (d+1+4). DEMON
TILE SPLITTER is to be executed BEFORE your opponent hits the ground.
** juggles cause the AI to 'fast recover' or roll out of falls, making it easier
for you to connect UNBLOCKABLES if timed correctly **  HOWEVER... if opponent
rolls away you will whiff... and if DEMON TILE SPLITTER is executed too early and
opponent rolls left or right, you will whiff.  Also... if opponent performs
rising kick (rare) you will be hit.  THIS CHOICE IS NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU
ARE CLOSE TO OBSTACLE/WALL or have backed your opponent into a CORNER!


CLOSE TO OBSTACLES/WALLS

CHOICE 1: Follow up with DIAMOND LANCE to smash your opponent into OBSTACLE/WALL.
If they are close enough the impact will stun them opening up the perfect 
opportunity for a variety of follow ups.  My favorite is DEMON BREATH... just 
because it's fast, easy to execute and causes significant dmage.

CHOICE 2: Follow up with DEMON TILE SPLITTER while keeping out of kick range.  As 
soon as they whiff the hammer will fall causing 70 points damage AND if you're 
lucky, a 6-8 second KO!!!

CHOICE 3: Literally smash them into the ground... =D  using TILE SPLITTER over,
and over, and over........ you get the picture =)  some people say it's cheap...
little do they know... there ARE ways to get out of this!  But we won't get into
that ;)  Let's keep them guessing!

CHOICE 4: Follow up with TGF and smash them into the wall.  When you land you'll
have just enough time to execute DEMON BREATH!  Follow up with TILE SPLITTER for
a guaranteed extra hit!

                     ----:::::::::::::::::::::::::::----

These are just a few of the possibilities available to you so BY NO MEANS should 
you restrict yourself to what's here!  Thanks to the dedication of NAMCO and 
staff we have a whole new world at our finger tips!  The preceding are just a 
list of the MOST USEFUL (to me ~_^) moves to achieve SUPERIOR TIMEATTACK scores
with HEIHACHI MISHIMA.


::VS HUMANS::

Since I played those CRAZY players the other night I've been questioning my own
skills... or lack thereof.  Hmmm.  Do I still have what it takes?  WHO CARES?!?
Like it says at the top... this is the NOT-SO-ULTIMATE GUIDE!

::BREAKDOWN::

HEIHACHI's moves have been compromised since his release in TEKKEN, TEKKEN2 and 
TEKKEN 3.  In TEKKEN 2 his WGF properties were awesome... it was one of, if not
THE most useful move in his arsenal.  However... in TEKKEN 3 they changed the 
hit property from 'm' to 'Sm'.  This simple change altered his whole character
gameplay... people no longer had to worry about being launched by WGF (which 
also causes significant damage in the process).  In TEKKEN 4 his gameplay has
ONCE AGAIN been altered!!!  The TILE SPLITTER = DEATHFIST combination has been
eliminated!  **in fact the DEATHFIST itself has been junked and replaced with 
DIAMOND LANCE**  The TILE SPLITTER = DEATHFIST combination was extremely useful
as it had a couple of benefits: 1) to keep your opponent on their toes... if used
properly, a useful tool for 'training' them to stay standing exposing them to 
L attacks.  2) The actual combination was a great tool for keeping opponents at
bay.  If they blocked the DEATHFIST it would push them WAY back leaving you
with lots of room to breathe and set up your next attack.

There are too many variables and possibilities to make an accurate guide to 
'proper' use of HEIHACHI so I have decided to list MOVES I find MOST USEFUL and
the most effective ways to use them... if I have left anything out please email
me and I'll post the new information in an updated version of HMNSUSG.  (with 
credit to YOU too!  Of course ~_^ )


::HEIHACHI-USEFUL MOVES::

ALTER SPLITTER
b+1 - to crouching opponents - slap them on the forehead!
DOUBLE PUNCH
1<2 - used to bulldog opponents (although slower than many other opponents)
DOUBLE PUNCH = ROUNDHOUSE
1<2=4 - useful when opponent misses move or after you've blocked move with a 
        slow recovery time.
SHINING FISTS
1,1<2 - same as above.
DEMON SLAYER
1<2,2 - same as above.
DEMON SLAYER = DEMON EXECUTIONER
1,2,2=~1+2 - confuses the hell out of your opponent!!! ESPECIALLY WHEN USED IN
             CONJUNCTION WITH...
DEMON SLAYER = DEMON EXECUTIONER = SIDE STEP CANCEL
1,2,2=~1+2=(u_d) - HEIHACHI circles around opponent a la KING / MARDUK =)
                   AND...
DEMON SLAYER = DEMON EXECUTIONER = SIDE STEP CANCEL = DEMON EXECUTIONER
1,2,2=~1+2=(u_d)=1+2 - change it up, use a THROW or DIAMOND LANCE to keep them
                       guessing!
DEMON LAIR
f+1<b+2,4 - good for pushing your opponent away and keeping them off balance...
            also useful for juggling if timed correctly.
TILE SPLITTER
d+1 - keep them on their toes... 'TRAIN' your opponent or smash them while
      they're ducking.  Great for playing the 'sleeping' game!  If they don't 
      know how to escape it, you can keep your opponent on the ground and take
      his WHOLE life guage!!!  CHEAP???  No such thing... they should do their
      homework!!!
TWIN PISTONS
d/f+1,2 - good for launching and keeping your opponent wary of crouching.
          SHOULD NOT BE USED as an attack but as a COUNTER ATTACK (after
          blocking).  If you miss with this one you'll surely be PUNISHED!
THUNDER GODFIST
f,N,d,d/f+1 - good for bridging the gap, very powerful but dangerous if misused.
DELAY THUNDER GODFIST
f,N,d,D/F,1 - good for bridging LARGER gaps and throwing opponents timing off.
SHATTERING PALM
b+1+2 - great for guessing game... pushes opponent away and can be delayed!
DEMON BREATH
1+2 - one of the MOST useful moves in his ARSENAL.  Great speed for counter
      attacks and POWERFUL to boot!  Bad recovery and range...
DEMON BOAR
b+2 - good for advancing and cornering... CH causes opponent to crumble leaving
      opportunity to PUNISH!!!
DEMON BACKHAND SPIN
2,2 - quick, reasonable damage.  Useful after blocked moves.
DEMON BACKHAND
f+2 - throw this in once in awhile... nice little advancing move, but BE CAREFUL
      poor recovery!  Use in conjunction with...
DEMON BACKHAND = DEMON BREATH
f+2=~1+2 - change up, just when they thought they had us figured out!
DEMON GODFIST
f,f+2 - VERY useful!  Starts juggles with decent damage, covers ground and if 
        blocked gives you quite a bit of room.  BUT if your opponent has a long
        range move WATCH OUT!!! (ie: PAUL - DEATHFIST) POOR RECOVERY TIME!
        ** hits crouching opponents **
WIND GODFIST
f,N,d,d/f+2 - good for counter attacking (after blocked moves) juggles with CH!
              throw in once in awhile hold 2 to delay and confuse opponent. 
              Does NOT hit crouching opponents!
DIAMOND LANCE
qcf+2 - ANOTHER EXTREMELY USEFUL MOVE!!!  Similar to Pauls DEATHFIST, covers
        lots of ground (use with crouching dash) causes significant damage, 
        pushes opponent away when blocked!  Good for counter attacking whiffed
        moves and low recovery moves.
DARK THRUST
WS+2 - strangely timed move causes HS and CS on a counter hit.  Follow up with
       TWIN PISTONS to start juggle.
SPLIT AXE KICK
f,f+3 - useful for crouching opponents, bounce juggle starter on CH!
DEMON GUT KICK
f,N,d,d/f+3 - mix up with...
DEMON SLICE KICK
f,N,d,D/F+3 - to keep them guessing.  Most people can't react in time to block
              the hits.  HEIHACHI spins around too fast to tell if he's
              attacking low or high.
HOP - DELAYED DEMON GUT KICK
f,N,d,d/f,f,u/f+3 - same as above but covers LOTS of ground, mix up with...
HOP - DELAYED DEMON SLICE KICK
f,N,d,d/f,f,u/f,d+3 - be careful!  Easy to counter attack because HEIHACHI runs
                      before hopping and kicking.  Gives you good distance if
                      blocked, pushes opponent away and is GB.
VISCERA SMASH
f+3 - good for setting up the 'sleeping' game =)  CH causes opponent to fall
      feet towards.  For some reason most people like to try and roll away...
      that's when we let the hammer fall with TILE SPLITTER!!!
HELL AXE
u/f+3,4 - great tool to back opponent into corners... execution is a little
          slow but it really pushes them back when blocked.  Good for
          counter attacking whiffed moves.
ROUNDHOUSE
4 - STRONG for a single button move!  CH causes opponent to crumple, leaving
    enough time to throw, DIAMOND LANCE or DEMON BREATH.
DELAY TSUNAMI KICK
(qcf_f,N,d,d/f,f_WS)+4<4 - very useful to follow grounded opponents or recover
                           from crouching position.
HELL SWEEP
f,N,d,D/F+4 - train your opponent!!!  and change up with...
HELL SWEEP = RISING KICK = TSUNAMI KICK
f,N,d,D/F+4=N,4,4 - to confuse them.  Leaves HEIHACHI open for attack if
                    blocked!
HELL SWEEP = THUNDER GODFIST
f,N,d,D/F+4=N+1 - if they start blocking your second HELL SWEEP punish them
                  with a nice TGF!!!
DIAMOND HELL SWEEPS
f,N,d,D/F+4:4:4 - even MORE useful as HEIHACHI will not suffer GUARD STUN even
                  when sweeps are blocked!  (JUST FRAME VERSION - HIGH 
                  DIFFICULTY!)
DIAMOND HELL SWEEPS = THUNDER GODFIST
f,N,d,D/F+4:4:4=:N+1 - same properties as above HELL SWEEPS.
DIAMOND HELL SWEEPS = RISING KICK = TSUNAMI KICK
f,N,d,D/F+4:4:4=:N+4,4 - same as above.
DEMON AXE KICK
f+4 - good for keeping opponent off balance.  Opponent ends up in CROUCHING
      GUARD POSITION, long enough for you to execute another attack.  Also
      leaves them face down feet away on CH.
DEMON SCISSORS
(u/f+4~3_4~3) - great for attacking downed opponents.  Dangerous if whiffed!
                leaves you lying on your back.
GETA STOMP
d+4 - punish opponents who roll to the right or just lie there.
SHADOW STEP
b,b,N+3+4 - give yourself some distance from your opponent!
DIAMOND WALL - GLOWING FISTS
b+2+4 - prepare your next hit to be guaranteed CH!  ** HEIHACHI CANNOT BLOCK
        WHILE FISTS ARE GLOWING!!! **  Not recommended when close to opponent..
        If they're attacking resulting in DIAMOND WALL REVERSAL, HEIHACHI 
        suffers 45 damage!
AUGER TAUNT
2+3+4 - get cocky ~_^
DEMON TILE SPLITTER
d+1+4 - not recommended unless you're playing a scrub or your opponent is
        backed into a corner!

** DON'T even bother with the string hits!  Most decent players will block all
   hits following second attack **


And there you have it HEIHACHI's useful moves and when to use them... It's
quite an extensive list but all great players will not limit themselves when
they have countless options.  Remember, humans have the ability to adapt very
quickly, and to pick up patterns... that's when you have to learn to 'train' 
your opponent.  If you limit yourself to only a few moves your gameplay will
become PREDICTABLE and you'll end up standing around waiting for your turn 
again... change up your moves and KEEP MOVING!!!  This is a 3 DIMENSIONAL game
so use all 3 Dimensions!  This is not a Capcom fighter!!!  Even Capcom fighters
in 3D were still in 2 dimensions!  Remember SFEX series?  3D my a$$!  The 
characters were rendered in 3D but they limited us to a 2D plane of movement!
Make use of what's at hand... SSing will help you get around bulldoggers!
HEIHACHI's jabs are too slow to beat out most opponents so you'll have to learn
to keep them at arms length or SS and COUNTER.


::VS BULLDOGS::

Unfortunately, as I mentioned above, HEIHACHI's jabs tend to come out slower 
than most of his attackers.  SSing is VITAL in your game against BULLDOGGERS.
It is, however, a feat easier said than done.  For some reason, everytime I play
against King users I choke!!!  Frikkin' piss me off... as soon as they figure 
out my tactics I start freakin' out and I freeze up... I don't know what to do 
and I just stand there.  If you're fighting against someone like King you really
have to keep your distance... or try to move in with DEMON SLAYER = EXECUTIONER
= SIDESTEP CANCEL = THROW or EXECUTIONER.  You really have to change it up
though... if they're ducking you have to do EXECUTIONER.. if they're standing
then you have to THROW.  If you notice that your opponent is delaying between
sets try to surprise them with DEMON BREATH in between.

Another VERY useful move for HEIHACHI is the HOP - DELAYED DEMON GUT/SLICE KICK!
It is almost imparative that you use this!  The SLICE KICK will usually get them
the first few times... then you have to change it up to a GUT KICK.  As soon as
they see you running in and hopping they'll start to block down letting you kick 
them in the face... NICE!  If you feel like it and you're close enough you can
do a CD and delay into HELL SWEEP, usually I don't like to let it go past the
first sweep (unless you have the JUST FRAME HELL SWEEP perfected) because if the
first seconed one is blocked it leaves you open for punishment!  Try to use HELL
SWEEP = RISING KICK = TSUNAMI KICK or HELL SWEEP = THUNDER GODFIST... TSUNAMI
KICK feels safer because it allows you to keep your distance while TGF sets you 
right at your opponents feet.


::VS TURTLES::

Turtlers are my favorite!!!  They leave you with as much room as you want!  Just
the kind of person who lets you exploit ALL of HEIHACHI's moves =).  With these
guys, half the time you can stand there and activate DIAMOND WALL allowing you
the extra few atatck points if you connect!  You don't have to worry about
getting hit because they're too scared to come out of their shells!  This is the
time to use DELAY HOP - SLICE KICK and start playing the 'sleeping game'! If you 
really wanna have some fun learn how to do the DEMON SLAYER = EXECUTIONER = SS
CANCEL ~_^ it's fun to see how many different combinations you can hit them with.
If you want to play around, hit them a couple of times and start SHADOW STEPPING!
It's like a game of tag... most people don't appreciate it.. but it CAN be VERY
useful even against the toughest opponents.  Why?  Because after you turn your
tail they have to cover the distance between the two of you, and that's when
HEIHACHI can be most lethal!



[vii]::[LAST WORDS]::[vii]

What?  You could have written this FAQ, you say?  Well then, WHY DIDN,T YOU?!?
LIke I said at the beginning, I wrote this because nobody else out there took
the time to write one out!  Since I started writing this FAQ I've had a couple
of chances to play T4 and test some of my theories... lo and behold!  Most of 
them stand firm!  Even against the best players my tips DO work... the key is to
be consistent!  Mix things up!  Keep them guessing by going up and down!  It's 
the only way... unfortunately I haven't had the chance to play a really good
Paul user.  Only once... so I haven't had much practise and can't document /
answer any questions VS PAUL.  Oh well... most people tend to stay away from him
anyway ~_^. If you have anything else you think might come in handy or would be
helpful in the development of HEIHACHI users e-mail me d4rkwind13@hotmail.com.



[viii]::[CREDITS and THANKS]::[viii]

Just want to give a shout out to K2R for introducing me to the TEKKEN series and
'forcing' me to play when you didn't have anyone to play against ~_^.  Thanks
bro!  Without you, this definitely wouldn't have been possible!  You whupped my
a$$ so bad with HEIHACHI that I finally saw the potential and... here I am! ^_^

JINX thanks for showing me where LION's LAIR ARCADE was!  and always going with
me!  We've had lots of fun times there... and one day I'll beat your TIME ATTACK
score with CHRISTIE!!! (JNX 3:12:78) (^_^;  You just wait!

NATHAN, hmmm what to say?  You surely are a worthy opponent!  You'll figure out
my HEIHACHI one day!  But till then... I'm just gonna have to give you a good
run for your money!  Thanks for being a great challenger and teacher!  Yeah
that's right, I've been secretly reading your mind and figuring out all your
tactics!  You're one of the most well-rounded players I've ever come across!!!
KUDOS!

DARK MAN X, for that wonderful disclaimer and permission for me to cut and paste
it into my FAQ! ^_^

TEKKEN ZAIBATSU and staff!!! Thanks for building such an awesome TEKKEN TREASURY
of FACTS, FORUMS and MORE! Without your FAQs, Movelists, Movies, frame data... I
prolly wouldn't have spent so many countless hours in a state of zombification!
(^^;)  You guys (and girl) are truly outstanding in your dedication to bringing
information from TEKKEN 4 and the rest of the series to the rest of us!

NAMCO!  The greatest 3D fighter producers!  Yeah... it's safe to assume that!
WOW!  What an accomplishment!  I can't wait to see the next game you all decide
to slap on us!  Whether it be another of the TEKKEN series or something 
completely different!  Thanks to all of you, for without all your skill and 
effort none of the FORMER MENTIONED (including me and all the TEKKEN-ers around
the world) would have anything to base our experiences on!!!  Keep up the great
work!

FINALLY, thanks to all of you who are reading this FAQ!  It's nice to know that
all those countless hours spent on putting this thing together weren't for 
nothing! Good luck, and I hope some, if not all, the information in here was
deemed useful to you! Thanks again!  And keep on gaming!
