*Jin's Enemies FAQ*

Dated: Dec. 3rd, 2001
Version: 1.3 (I added all of the missing characters except for Lei and updated old ones,
                       especially one that I blew off. If you don't want to spend too much time
                       looking for new changes; I've used CAPITAL LETTERS for new words and
                       sentences and *'s for new paragraphs!!!)



This faq has no real copyright and anyone can copy it, plagiarize it, take credit for it,
and even make money with it. You can put it on your website without my name atached. You
can even roll it up and smack one of my fellow Jin players with it!! Honest!! o_O !!

* This FAQ is very opponent-oriented in terms of strategy. I deal with each character by
first describing their fighting style(s) and then what Jin ought to do in response. What I
mean by an opponent's fighting style is virtually; their favorite moves, traps, strengths
and weaknesses. While I may not have every character's every fighting style accounted for, I
will in the future. Trust me. ^_^ When I make changes to this FAQ, they will be big time
changes, so please check it out if you see a Jin Kazama FAQ update in the Update section of
www.tekkenzaibatsu.com!

Although I am Korean, this FAQ is in English. Although Korea rules, this FAQ is in English.
Although Korean is a better phoenetic language, this FAQ is in English. Although Koreans
rule the Tekken gaming world, this FAQ is in English. (the truth of the matter is, I'm an
English minor and can't speak or write Korean too well; YES, I AM A TWINKIE -_- !!)

**********************
*1. A General Introduction*
**********************


Most characters are always standing and have a good balance of short, long distance, high
and low hitting moves. The thing is, is that you're Jin, and you're in their face. The other
guy will be blocking, not attacking. You'll be so close that they cant use powerful moves or
long range moves. They won't go with low kicks because you'll interrupt them with Jab
Strings. The other guy will try to counter jab your fast jabs. He will try to duck jab you.
But it won't work. So against someone like Law with a fast jab, you'll just parry and set
yourself up for some Jab Strings. Trust me, the first thing you learn as a new Tekken 4
player is to jab and duck jab. But these strategies are useless against Jin with his
parries and guard breaking Jab String combos. He "bulldogs" with these moves.

However, everyone knows that one strategy does not apply to all the forms of fighting an
opponent can throw at you. Especially so, when you can fight characters who can change their
fighting style (Hwoarang, Steve, Jin). But most characters currently have only one style of
play (Paul, Kazuya, Heihachi), so learning how to bulldog with Jin is your best option. 

* That doesn't mean that there aren't exceptions. Lei, Ling and Christie are such exceptions.
Top tier and nearly impossible to bulldog, I had to spend a mean amount of dollars to find
effective strategies against these folks. They're still not definitive but they will
definitely help you avoid getting pounded and embarassed next time you play them.


************
*2. Hwoarang*
************


   Hwoarang is considered a great distance fighter. And this is what you must be prepared
   for, especially against a good Hwoarang player. A good Hwoarang's main weapon of choice
   is his Flamingo Stance. He'll hit you so many different and powerful moves with such high
   priority that dashing in or even sidestepping can be incredibly dangerous. The second
   weapon is a complete arsenal all its own. The Flamingo Stance Combo Strings. Confusing,
   delayable, nearly uninterruptable when not delayed, and lasting for 7-10 hits at a time,
   these strings are incredibly dangerous. As soon as you are caught blocking a Flamingo
   Stance Combo String (FSCS), there are three main things to look out for.

   The first thing is, a cancelled kick that turns into a simple 1 jab. It is sudden and
   seems to end the FSCS. However, this is every Hwoarang's favorite sneaky trick. They can
   immediately follow up this jab with a powerful higher priority kick that is still
   technically part of the FSCS!! If you try to duck, chances are you will get your head
   smacked. If you try to counterjab, you will definitely get fakked. If you sidestep, you
   will almost certainly get hit. In other words, you must block after you see that jab! Its
   a setup for him to get a counter-hit, which can give him an enormous frame advantage!!

   The second thing, unfortunately, is that the very same sneaky jab can immediately be
   followed up by a throw attempt. o_O ?! Yes, I know. Good Hwoarangs will switch between
   the two options and leave you paralyzed. Your only choice is to escape the throw attempt
   by mashing 1+2. Doesn't sound like much, but trying to counter during the FSCS or ducking
   will almost certainly get punished. Don't take the chance and just block until he's
   finished the FSCS with a kick that knocks you far away if guarded. If you have trouble
   escaping throws, you must practice, being able to escape throws is a must for T4 players
   and you'll find that it gets easier after awhile.

   The third thing, even more unfortunately, is a slow, low backwards sweep that can knock a
   player down if he sidesteps. Once knocked down, Hwoarang can start a great okizeme game
   from that exact kick. Now you have to worry about ducking low!?! Yes. Most Hwoarangs
   won't end the FSCS with a hard kick because of the high reset time. Therefore, they'll
   switch using the sneaky jab and this move. However, once you start blocking this move, a
   Rising Uppercut (WS+2) is nearly guaranteed as a counter and a launch.

   When you look at all you must worry about because of the FSCS, your only choice is to
   never allow him to start it. Bulldog him from the get-go and he will be forced to turn
   into a closeup game Hwoarang. This Hwoarang is easy. He has nearly no moves, only
   (1,1)'s, (1,2)'s, ducking pokes and Bolt Cuts (b+2). Even his Rising Uppercut (WS+2) is
   very slow. Once you get this Hwoarang, parry his jabs and force him to duck your
   repeating Jab Strings (1,2...). Once he starts ducking, start using Alt Jab Strings
   (2,1...) and Can-Can Kicks (d+3+4) to abuse him.

   If Hwoarang does get breathing room by nailing you with, let's say a a Bolt Cut (b+2),
   then your far away game is limited to timing Laser Series (b,f+2,1...) correctly as
   counterhits and Can-Can Kicks (d+3+4). Dashing in will get you caught up into a FSCS.
   Jin does not have long range pokes and relies on counterhitting at exactly the right
   time with the two previous moves.

   There is another Hwoarang player who is VERY tough. This guy is just complete
   unpredictability. He'll use Bolt Cut (b+2) a lot, because of the built in sidestep. He'll
   use Tsunami Kick (WS+4,4) instead of Rising Uppercut for a great double kick which hits
   mid on both. And he'll use Nose Bleeder (b+4) which is nearly exactly the same as Can-Can
   Kicks in that it hits mid, its speed is similiar, its great priority once started, and
   the fact it also launches. He'll also use the annoying Crippler Fear Kick (d/b+4,4) which
   is nearly impossible to block the first low kick unless you really anticipate it. He'll
   also use the Flying Eagle (3~4) since it hits mid and is powerful. He'll also use
   conventional Machine Gun Kicks to hit people who duck the first kick and will start a
   FSCS once in awhile. He WILL abuse throws.

   You must poke. Although the above moves have high priority, he can be hit of out of them
   if you simply 1 jab his face. Do so in an annoyingly matter and he will start blocking. You
   then bulldog him and prevent him to have any breathing room otherwise he'll throw out any
   one of high priority moves mentioned above. DO NOT DUCK. You will get tagged and get
   set up for a throw or FSCS. Try to sidestep him since many Hwoarangs don't use high reset
   time high side ranging kicks like Rejection (u/f+4) which will take 25% damage. O_O !!

   * If you get knocked down on the ground and Hwoarang's near you. DO NOT MOVE. If you
   try to roll or kick him, he will launch you with the Nosebleeder (b+4) or juggle you with the
   Crippler Fear Kick (d/b+4,4). Every decent Hwoarang knows to do one of these two moves to
   grounded people and they'll never fail at it. Your ONLY choice is to take the hit. If they use
   one of those two moves and you lie still, you'll take very little damage and will get pushed far
   back enough so you can get up safely. DON'T FORGET THIS.

   Bulldog, or prepare to spend a lot of time staggering to get up in quite possibly the
   most shortest match you've ever had. Trust me, I like this type of Hwoarang myself and I
   can beat relatively good opponents, if I'm lucky from the get-go, in less than 10 seconds.
   I WROTE 3 SECONDS LAST TIME??? WHAT WAS I, ON CRACK OR SOMETHING?? @_@
   You cannot do that with any other character. No one, no matter what you throw in, can do
   what Hwoarang can do.


*****************
*3. Paul, Law, Bryan*
*****************


   Law, Paul and Bryan are nothing special. They too, rely on bulldogging to a certain extent.
   However, their Jab Strings are nowhere near as bufferable as Jin's. Jin can repeat this Jab
   String (1,2,3) three times in a row without fear of retaliation, unless the guy figures to sidestep
   the 3 kick. These three have nothing like that. They also rely on Parrys (b+2+4). But if they
   Parry you, they will come in with a (1,2) that you can block and Parry as well!!

   Individually, learn Law's annoying 3 hit combo (backhand, low kick, then high kick)
   because it'll chip away at your life unless you duck and block the second move. When you
   Parry the 1st punch of his Jab Strings, most of his follow up moves will whiff you
   completely, allowing you destroy him with frame advantage Jab Strings or Kazama Rage
   combos (1,3,2,1,4). Bulldog him with Alt Jab Strings (2,1...) and he won't have a chance.

   With Paul, watch out for his Shoulder Rush (f+1+4), it's strong, puts distance between
   the two of you and auto-sidesteps. And learn his 8 or 9 string combo. It's used often
   by Paul players, but if you block the fourth hit which hits low, and the last hit which
   hits low, then you're all set for a EWHF or a Rising Uppercut. I've also found that some
   good Pauls can interrupt some of your bulldoggin with his (1,2)'s. If you see this, then
   Parry his (1,2)'s. If you find yourself at a distance, watch for Paul's Death Fist (qcf+2). It is
   very popular, but very recognizable. Especially so, when they're far away and they're trying
   to close the distance. When you expect this move, throw the Can-Can Kicks (d+3+4) out.
   Once started, it'll take higher priority and launch his monkey ass into the air. When I fight
   Paul, I connect this move at least 2 times in a SINGLE round. Think about it, 2 Can-Can's
   + 2 juggles = nearly 70%. Also, because of Paul's Parry Counter, repeating Alt Jab Strings
   can get dangerous. If he Parry Counters your 2nd jab, get up and immediately throw out a
   Rear Thrust (2,4). This is a simple one-two combo; it throws out a 2 jab and then follows
   with a spinning back roundhouse to the face. If he tries to Parry Counter the 2nd hit, he
   will get hit because the kick is ever so slightly delayed. Beautiful. I connect this at least
   once a match. It'll teach him to try and Parry Counter and he will start to refrain from
   using it. One more thing off your mind.

   Decent Bryan players will tend to Parry your Jabs and start some combos. If you get
   parried you will probably get nailed by his Mach Fist (f,f+2). If this keeps happening,
   step back and Laser Series (b,f+2,1...) his gut, which WON'T be parried. Bryan's Wolf Bit
   sweep (d/f+4) is annoying, so learn to block low and then immediately follow with Laser
   Series. If he doesn't Parry you, then can own him with your bulldoggin techs.

   * All in all, Bryans power lies in his juggles and "extreme" hits like the Mach Breaker
   (f,f+2), Slash Kick (f,f+3) and Mach Kick (f,f+4). The thing is, is that he has to be
   bulldoggin in order to use these effectively otherwise he'll just end up whiffing them or
   getting them blocked. Decent Bryans will change up bulldoggin with these to confuse you.
   The catch is, you're Jin and no one can bulldog Jin because he; first of all, usually
   bulldogs first, and second, can parry. If you find yourself on the receiving end of
   repeated combos, try ducking during the middle of his combos. They tend to be limited to
   high punches, high kicks and low kicks. There aren't a lot of mid hits during the more
   common combos. So if you duck, you will either dodge his high hitting moves or block his
   low kick whereupon you can give him a Rising Uppercut (WS+2) and launch his ass.


********************
*4. Kazuya and Heihachi*
********************


   Kazuya's own Jab Strings, are surprisingly slower than Jin's. The one thing, you have to
   worry about are two moves: his Thunder Godfist (EWHF+1) which has the same priority as
   your own EWHF. And THOSE GOD DAMN HELL SWEEPS!! ~@#%#^!%&~$ ARGHHH!
   But block those consistently and you'll own Kazuya. Kazuya, is in my opinion quite poor.
   Parry his Jab  Strings and repeat your Alt Jab Strings and this particular Jab String (1,2,3). My
   favorite one because of the guard breaking axe kick. Also, Many Kazuyas have a tough time
   blocking low, so break out a Kazama Rage (1,3,2,1,4) once in awhile. If the last kick connects,
   you're golden. (Please read Kazama-Yama Boy Jin FAQ if you don't know why you're golden
   and sparkly and all purty and stuff...) @_@ ??

   * Kazuya is also very susceptible to sidesteps. If he isn't Demon Sweeping you like crazy,
   many of his punches like; Thunder Godfist (EWHF+1), Glorious Demon Fist (f+1+2); and
   many of his punch combos; Shining Fists (1,1,<2), Twin Pistons (WS+1,2), will completely
   whiff if you sidestep them. Kazuya completely sucks against a frequent sidestepper. Try
   not to duck too often as he does have nice mid hitting hooks and those Thunder Godfists.
   Watch out for the Twin Pistons. I never fail to forget to block the 2nd uppercut because
   I'm too aggressive and its ever so slightly delayed. Don't make the same mistake because
   you'll get launched and that's where Kazuya's strength lies, in really high damaging juggles.
   In closing, don't duck and sidestep a lot.

   * Heihachi is a different kind of player. He has more varied moves and during the middle
   of some seemingly simple combo, can buffer in some mean hits. I'm sure you've watched the
   computer do the same. But they almost all hit high or mid, so just stand and block until
   you've blocked a high-priority move and start bulldogging him. He is also dangerous when
   he has a little bit of room to breath. His Shattering Palm (b+1+2) will hit duckers and
   sidesteppers, so try to avoid doing either when he is about two dash distances away from
   you. There is one dangerous annoyance about him and it's, yep, Hell Sweeps (f,N,d,d/f+4).
   If you get nailed by the first and second, get ready to watch 40% go away. He's got mean
   juggles off of this one. But don't despair just yet. Fortunately, even if you get hit by the first
   sweep, you can block the second one and avoid the juggle. So you have nothing to fear from  
   constantly standing. He does have change ups for those Hell Sweeps, but unless he has
   room to use it, you won't encounter all the different chaneups BECAUSE YOU WILL BE 
   BULLDOGGIN HIS ASS with your Jab Strings and Laser Series. Learn to be quick to block
   the second Hell Sweep and Heihachi is really quite easy. And one last piece of advice, DON'T 
   DUCK. He does have some mean uppercuts and powerful mid hitting punches.
   

*****************
*5. Yoshimitsu, Nina*
*****************


   Yoshimitsu and Nina are strong distance fighters. Get in close and don't bother parrying them,
   they don't commit to using quick high pokes like Steve. Just do your best to close the gap
   and keep pressuring them. All in all, get in their face and bully them. Their short game is
   lacking as far as I've experienced. When Yoshi sits down, use Can-Can Kicks. If he's rolling
   on the ground towards you, duck high or you'll get launched. Once you duck high. you have
   a guaranteed Rising Uppercut (WS+2).

   * Unfortunately, Nina players tend to be above average. And there's one really hard Nina to
   fight. Its turtle Nina. This Nina will just block all day long. She'll block your Jab Strings and
   then time a Parry Counter to start up a friggin nasty String. ARGH!!! This will take nearly
   45& of your energy away because of the diffuculty in breaking the String. I have an easier
   time with King's Strings! My only advice, if you don't know how to break Nina's String is to
   press 2 on the counter, 1+2 on the following hold, 1 on the following hold and 1+2 on the
   last hold. You have to press the corresponding button right when she begins the next throw.
   It works sometimes and the timing is damn hard. Mashing never works. Otherwise, ask some
   tekkenzaibatsu gurus in the forums. They know better than me. She'll also try to nab in a two
   kick combo. I don't know the name or input but I'll try to explain it to you. The first kick is a
   low right sweeping kick and then Nina twists her body around and hits you with a high
   spinning backwards left kick. The second kick launches and if the first kick gets in as a
   counter-hit, the second hit is guaranteed. This is in my opinion, the only error in T4. The 
   combo in total is quite slow and the second kick shouldn't have guarantee on counter. My
   jaw gapes when it happens and I think its absolute BS. But we have to deal with it. Nina
   likes to use this when your dashing in or sidestepping so that she can get the
   scrubby-ass guarantee launcher. Her juggle in strong so you can't risk dashing in. That's
   why you don't advance with dashing, you advance with Laser Series.

   * Laser Series is your best weapon against Nina, up close or far, she will Parry Counter  your
   Jab Strings and counter-hit you with the scrub 2-kick launcher. So, you just JF her ass all day
   long. This is the only time I encourage constant JF'ing. This type of good Nina player does
   not sidestep often, she just turtles. So JF'ing is now your best friend. Use it mercilessly and
   hopefully, she'll just go away instead of learning how to sidestep it. If she sidesteps, switch
   up with the regular d+2 ender that'll snag sidesteppers.


******************
*6. King and Marduk*
******************


   King is USUALLY a friggin joke. Throw your Jab Strings at his face and he can't do crap.
   Your Kazama Rage's last kick hits low which he can't catch. Bully them into the corner and
   watch him try in vain to duck low to avoid your jabs, trying to set you up for an uppercut, but
   laugh as you catch the back of his head with the Axe kick (1,2,3). Start the match with an
   EWHF so that King's jump kick (a favorite match starter for some King players) won't launch
   you and will severely embarass that sorry excuse for a King player. But there are two
   responses to bulldogging that a King player can choose however. One is to keep his
   distance and the other is to String Art/"Jab and Grab."

   * The distance King is very easy. Although he has suprisingly good distance moves, you
   have better, since much of his distance moves have high reset times. If you have some
   distance between the two of you, try to make him whiff his Disgrace Kick (b+4), you know,
   the turn around right heel kick that makes King have his back turned, whereupon, he'll
   usually followup with that groin kick. (It's a favorite of King's players and very common for
   okizeme). If he whiffs that, Laser Series his back for big damage and use the regular 2 ender
   for better damage since you can't launch him with his back turned. Then step up to him and
   start bulldoggin him.

   * There is one good King fighting style. It involves his String Arts and the aptly phrased
   "Jab and Grab" techniques described by Vale_Tudo_Freak in his Craig Marduk FAQ. His
   String Arts first of all, are not incredibly hard to learn after watching them a couple of times.
   The danger is the last hit, which is a throw attempt that is guaranteed if the last two hits of
   the String Art connect. If you got hit during the middle of one of King's String Arts, be
   prepared to mash the 2 button to escape the throw. It's easy to escape that throw, so don't
   worry too much about King's String Art in general.

   * However, if King starts the "Jab and Grab" techniques, be prepared to get frustrated. The
   "Jab and Grab" technique is to merely interrupt a Jab String or String Art with a well timed
   throw attempt. Logically, King has by far, the best ability to do this. It is EXTREMELY
   HARD to interrupt this and out of nearly 30 times the guy's attempted the "Jab and Grab"
   against me, even if I knew it was coming, I'd get thrown. I might have been pressing the
   wrong buttons, but seriously, I have no problem escaping other throws. The only strategy
   I've come up with against a Jab and Grab is to start jabbing them after the fourth hit of his
   combo string which gives the best frame advantage for a throw attempt. This will poke them
   out of the throw attempt and leave you with the ability to start Jab Stringing their ass.

   Marduk is slightly better because he has two good distance options. His Jab String combos
   can end with a kick that can create a nice buffer zone for Marduk to operate within. Using that
   space, one of every Marduk players' favorite moves is the Bazooka Heel (b+4). It is a fast long
   range gut hitting reverse heel. Anyone who plays Marduk once, will know this move. Its
   dangerously powerful. You must simply try to fake him out into whiffing the move so that
   you can connect a Torso Thrust (f,f+2) or Laser Series. His other distance option is the Vale
   Tudo Stance (3+4). He basically looks like a front lineman who's about to deck you to the
   next state. You can avoid this with a simple ducking jab. But you will get nabbed once in
   awhile and get mounted. Once mounted you have no choice but to counter his punches.
   Press 1+3 to counter right punches and 2+4 for left punches. The timing is rough in the
   beginning but is a must for any T4 player to learn. If you don't know how to escape, then
   nearly 40% of your energy is gone and he has room to operate again. But if you block a
   punch perfectly once, or semi-perfectly twice, then Marduk will be forced to Dismount. If
   someone gets me in the VT Mount, it honestly doesn't mean crap to me anymore because I
   escape it so easily. Practice and you will too. Just watch out for the Bazooka Heel right after
   he dismounts!

   * One more thing, if you consistently escape his VT Mount with either 1+3 or 2+4, your
   opponent may begin to use the Counter Punches. These Counter Punches are dangerous
   because when you try to use 1+3 or 2+4, you will get re-countered and he'll armbar you. So
   what do you do??? Start using 1 and 2. These will normally block punches, but if he starts
   using the Counter Punches, these will actually start countering again and force him to
   dismount. If he doesn't use these, then just counter him with 1+3 and 2+4.

   * Another thing to be wary about is the Repeating Tackler. This guy will Tackle you, then 
   once he gets off, try to Tackle you again. And to be honest, this strategy works. If you don't
   get up quickly, roll back, or roll to the side, you will get Tackled again. My best advice if you
   keep getting VT Tackled is to just lie down when he's finished with a Mount. He'll start the
   Tackle but will grab air, whereupon you can smack his face with a wakeup kick of your choice.
   I prefer 4 since most players when whiffing the tackle will automatically try to block low. 
   Otherwise, if he tries to Tackle you while both of you are standing, quickly do a Can-Can
   Kicks. Although it won't launch, both kicks will connect and leave him fairly closeby,
   whereupon you can start up some okizeme.

   * Marduk's Jab Strings are suprisingly fast. Although they are supposed to be slower,
   Marduk players really practice well with his Jabs, so they're timing is usually right on.
   Therefore, you might find your bulldogging getting interrupted by successful pokes and
   counter jabs. In this case, step back and start using Laser Series, Corpse Thrust (d+1) or
   Spin Heel Kick (b+4). (Take a look at my other Jin FAQ on how to use these moves really
   well). Parries, while great against others, don't have much use against Marduk as they don't
   commit to Jab Strings in a predictable enough of a manner.


********
*7. Steve*
********


   Steve is tough for most players. But for Jin, he's actually a snap. Well, after fighting a really
   good Steve for four consectutive hours at an arcade, now he's a snap. ^_^ I've fought three
   distinct types of Steve players.

   The first is the bulldogger who likes to poke with 1, 1, 1,.. then a nice sway combo that'll hit
   mid then high. He'll just move towards you and start swayin so your counter 1,2's are
   neutralized. He'll throw out a throw once in a while to put you on the ground, but not often
   since Steve's okizeme options are limited. 

   Basically, PARRY. It'll give you an advantage over a poker Steve. Just follow up a Parry with
   a Jab String or duck jab into whatever; just don't abuse the Rising Uppercut because
   everyone knows about that and if Steve blocks it, he can hit you with a 1,2 before you can
   reset.

   Now once you've done this, chances are Steve won't be a monkey's ass and get hit by your
   ducking jabs and parry counter jabs. He'll start being the second type of Steve player. By far,
   the easiest. This Steve player keeps his distance and tries to use the Low Sweep Punch to trip
   you, dash in for more poking, or most popularly, use confusing looking sway techs to get
   closer and hit mid. Hitting mid is dangerous since it doesn't push you back far, is probably a
   setup for a one-two smacker combo, and makes you stagger. Steve is fast and can quickly
   close the gap and start the poke game again. 

   Basically against this guy, first learn how to block that Low Sweep Punch. You do that and
   you have an guaranteed Rising Uppercut that'll launch the stupid Brit everytime he throws
   that out. Keep in mind that the Low Sweep Punch is also used to end some of his combos.
   Just recognize it and punish him for throwing out that sad excuse for a sweep, otherwise, you
   get hit by it at least twice. There is another popular low hitting punch used as a poke. It's too
   fast to anticipate, and if you turtle-duck then you get smacked big-time by his swaying
   mid-hitting techs. So just forget those and take em like a man. Most of the time he's far away
   and trying to sway which makes him dodge high moves. So use high priority low or mid
   moves when he's about to close the distance gap. Always wait for him to come to you. Jin's
   lifting Can-Can Kicks (d+3+4) are a perfect example. I hit a Steve player at least twice with
   this every round, I'm serious. The sway is great against someone you think will jab or high
   kick, but it sucks against Laser Series and Alt Jab Strings.

   The third Steve player is rough. He basically acts like a real boxer. He'll ditch the scrubby low
   hits and just focus on moving in and out and sidestepping. A good Steve player, in fact the
   best, will sidestep and throw out a 1,2. These are hard to fight because your 1,2 is your first
   thought, but he'll literally beat you to the punch. The only thing you can do, is play exactly
   like him. So sidestep, move in and out and PARRY!!

   This kind of Steve player likes to be close, but won't spend all day in-close. He'll throw out a
   hard punch that'll put distance between you if you block it and start sidestepping again to
   confuse you. When in close, I've found that they like to use that Machine Gun Gut Punch
   into High Uppercut move. I don't know the name, but you'll know it when you see it.
   Anyway, it causes you to block for a while and guard stagger. That staggering time will
   allow Steve to sway, move back or 1,2 you again. Just imitate his movements and use your
   ducking jabs, sidesteps and Parries. Just don't try to run away from him. Don't bulldog him
   yourself. Don't use high reset time moves. He'll punish you. Also, forget about counter
   jabbing him, just duck poke him and don't follow up. Just hit him once. Not much damage
   but it'll frustrate this type of Steve player after the third time you hit him with one measly
   duck punch. He'll get more bold and careless and commit himself to high reset time moves.
   Your chance to punish. 

   I actually admire the boxer Steve. He is the hardest to fight and shows you how accurate a
   fighting simulation Tekken 4 is. This Steve player's movements are just beautiful and will
   have you thinking about real boxing bouts.


*******
*8. Lee*
*******


   First thing's, first. If you bulldog Lee, he'll be completely destroyed, trust me. His pokes are
   limited to ducking jabs, which if he uses constantly to get out of your repeating Jab Strings,
   throw in a Can-Can Kicks in the middle of your bulldoggin to launch his ass. But if the Lee
   player you're fighting is decent, he'll have found a way to get some space, whereupon he
   has now become dangerous. And this guy's something. I fought a great Lee player and the
   only way I can describe him is Lethal Lee. Let me explain. This guy used three main weapons
   as the basis for his offence.

   The first was something that irritated the hell out of me at first. That's the Laser EdgeRush
   (D+4<4<4<4~3). It's basically three low kicks followed by a hella-strong mid hitting
   roundhouse. The thing is, if the last hit of the three kicks connect, the last mid-kick will be
   guaranteed and can leave him in Hitman Stance. Damn annoying. The first thing you must
   learn is to block the second or third low kick once you recognize this combo. Even if the first
   one or two hit, you can still block the following kicks. (Whew! ^_^) If you don't, they'll abuse
   this again and again. Otherwise, you can completely neutralize this attack if you consistently
   block the second or third low kick since one or two low kicks equals crappy damage. Follow
   the blocks with a Jab String to pressure him and close the distance or with a Laser Series.

   His second weapon of choice are his Jab Strings. He throws this out every once in awhile
   when he sees that your consistently blocking his kicks and punishing their long reset times.
   His Jab Strings look quite similiar to Law's. Many of the hits hit mid and just like Law's, if
   you get smacked by one of the later hits of the Jab String, the rest of the hits are guaranteed.
   Your defense against this is your Parries. Even if you Parry the first or second, you must
   still block the rest of the string, but the fact that you Parried gives you more frame advantage
   and you can immediately follow with a Jab String to bulldog him again. And if you're REALLY
   good, you can Parry every single one of his punches since they almost all hit high or mid.

   His third weapon is the Hitman Stance. Now, there are a bunch of moves he can shoot out while
   in this stance, including a really strong sweep, a really fast backhand launcher and an
   unblockable kick throw that is wins big in style points. o_O Seriously, that kick throw is damn
   cool! But anyway, the sweep is really you're only big worry. Its delayed like everyone elses
   special sweeps like Law's, Bryan's and Nina's, so train yourself to block low once you see it. I
   don't encourage ducking constantly while he is in Hitman Stance because of the backhand
   launcher that hits mid. If he launches you, Lee has some mean juggles. And that's where his
   strength lies. If you see him going into Hitman Stance, the best thing you can do is wait for him
   to attack since many Lees don't use that unblockable Kick throw, a shame really. If you're
   violent and wanna kill him, the best and safest move I've found is a very fast Laser Series. You 
   probably won't hit him, but if he tries to attack from Hitman Stance, which he most certainly will,
   you can nab a counter-hit Laser Series. If you nab a counter-hit Laser Series, just do the regular
   d+2 uppercut launcher and juggle his ass.


******
*9. Jin*
******


   Jin can be your easiest or toughest matchup. If the fool relies on JF'ing, just sidestep
   immediately after the 2nd hit of the Laser Series. He'll go past you and you will have the
   oppurtunity to do whatever you please.

   But if he's not monkey-ass Jin, then he's bulldoggin Jin. He'll come at you from the get-go.
   Your bulldogging can be completely negated by one Parry and then he'll start bulldogging
   you. He will know about your Can-Can Kicks and will try to make you whiff them. He will
   also whip out the quick Demon Sweep (d+4) a couple of times in a row to make you duck and
   then he'll use Alt Jabs, Laser Series or Can-Can Kicks on you.

   So how do you fight him??? First, do the things I just mentioned in the previous paragraph.
   Next, use this alternate Laser Series (b,f+2,1,d+2). The uppercut ender will catch someone
   who will try to jab you and many who try to sidestep because it is immediate and not
   interruptable. You can fool him into thinking you're monkey-ass Jin trying to JF and get a
   serious advantage.

   There is one other Jin player, who is very tough. It is boxer Jin. He relies on sidesteps,
   Parries, Jab Strings, Alt Jab Strings and Demon Sweeps. All of these moves are fast and when
   put together, make it hard for you to pin the sucker down. Steve, Ling and Christie are the
   only ones who have a good chance of snagging him. In this situation,... yup, you guessed it;
   imitate him. Do not use Can-Can Kicks or Laser Series. Chances are you will whiff against this 
   player. THESE PLAYERS ARE RARE, BECAUSE ITS JUST PLAIN NOT FUN TO PLAY IN 
   THIS MANNER, BUT YOU WILL FIND SOME JIN PLAYERS SWITCHING IN AND OUT OF 
   THIS FIGHTING STYLE. SO, WHEN HE SWITCHES, YOU SWITCH.


********
*10. Ling*
********


   Oh boy. Here we go. Your best weapon against any Ling player is Hwoarang. Hwoarang          
   murderilizes Ling. I'm serious. His b+3, WS+4,4 and d/b+4,4 completely destroy Ling. But
   that doesn't help Jin players, so let me give you some strats with Jin in case you don't like 
   murderlizing Ling players with Hwoarang (which is REALLY fun, honest! ^_^).

   Most good Ling players center their game around three things. Punch combos, Raindance
   Arts and the AOP Stance. Her punch combos are all high and mid hits; although some are      
   delayable, they are laughably easy to block and punish with Laser series. Ling players only
   use these to switch up a game of Raindance and AOP.

   Her Raindance can be quite deadly. It is basically when Ling's back is turned to you. And
   anyone whose played T4, knows that Ling is dangerous when her back is turned. Many Ling
   players like to either quickly follow a Turnaround with the incredibly fast Dark and Stormy
   (2,1,4). 2 punches hit high and the kick mid, so just standing and blocking, then following with
   a Can-Can Kicks (if you're close enough) or a Laser Series (if you're not) is a great way to stop
   her from using this. But good Ling players switch up this and a step behind shin kick that hits
   low for decent damage and leaves her backturned. I'm not sure about the name or input, but its
   quite fast and hard to block on reaction. However, if you decide to turtle to block this, then
   they'll launch you with the Juggle Mistrust (4), which is the same launching kick as the last kick
   of the Dark and Stormy. You're only choice is to eat the kick. When you eat the kick however,
   do not rush in to attack. She'll probably follow up the shin kick with a quick elbow thrust. Once
   again, I'm not sure about the name or input, but this can be repeated several times and can
   really hurt on counter. Another weapon out of Raindance (yes, there's more... o_O) is her
   California Roll (f+3+4). She basically just rolls up to you. Doesn't sound dangerous, but it takes
   many players by surprise to see a little ball of red or pink rolling towards there knees. That
   split second delay in reaction is all Ling needs to launch you with her Reverse Kangaroo Kick
   (~3+4) when you try to duck poke her. You NEVER want to be launched by Ling. Therefore,
   when her back is turned and she's in Raindance, you must always block high. You MUST wait
   for her to attack first because her high priority hits eat up a lot on counter-hits and can
   potentially juggle you. You just wait for her to use a high priority attack and then Laser Series
   her. Unfortunately,... (I said there was more dammit O_O), when she sees that you're turtling
   high, she'll throw a lot of jabs and then try a throw attempt that flows very easily and can
   easily be defined as another Jab and Grab player. o_O ?! So you must train yourself to escape
   her throw. Her throws looks fast, but you still have the same window of oppurtunity to escape
   them with 2. Almost all her throws are escaped with 2.

   Whew! Ok, now on to her best and hardest weapon (O_O !!!). Yes. AOP Stance Abusers are      
   VERY hard to fight with Jin. The thing is, is that when she goes into AOP Stance, since she's
   going extremely low, she'll automatically avoid high, mid and even special mid hits! Hits like the
   Can-Can Kicks, that will usually wreck duckers will WHIFF!!! O_O !! I KNOW!!! I was like, 
   WTF!?!? In fact, nearly every character has the same problem with Ling save for Hwoarang
   whose b+3 tends to hit her for some reason, I guess since it's really fast. I know that most Jin
   players love Can-Can Kicking duckers and turtles, but it won't work against Ling. You're only
   attack really is Demon Sweep (d+4). But AOP is so fast, that she'll probably have whipped out
   an attack that will counter your Demon Sweep before it can come out. I won't go into a list, but
   she's got one mean sweep that's really fast and always knocks you down that sets up for one
   nasty ass okizeme game, and a whole host of fast mid hitting move that can knock you down on 
   counter, which again, sets you up for a nasty okizeme game. Your only choice is to train yourself
   to know when to block low against her sweep. Otherwise, always block high and try to jab poke
   her occasionally after she's been in AOP for awhile and she's just sitting there. DO NOT try to
   duck poke her when she first goes into it, my duck pokes have whiffed and I have been punished.
   If you find your experience to be different, please e-mail me. I'd greatly appreciate good news.

   Why "greatly"? Simply because you cannot bulldog with Jin, you can't launch her with Can-Can 
   Kicks if she's an AOP Stancer, you can't throw her cuz she's either poking or ducking and you
   can't even really Demon Sweep her which seems to be your only logical choice against her
   because she's so fast. Jin is really poor against Ling and only through learning your opponent's 
   strategy while fighting him do you have a chance. But really, there's nothing you can take into a
   fight with Ling that works great. I'm sorry for all this bad news, but this is why Ling dominates 
   tournaments and arcades. Everyone except Hwoarang suffers from the same problem. In closing,
   Jin's Laser Series work relatively well when you know you have an open window. His Jab String 
   (1,2,-3) is relatively good since the third kick can catch her when she tries to do AOP or just plain    
   duck.


***********
*11. Christie*
***********


   Oh boy. Another one. While not as hard as Ling, she still exploits Jin. You cannot really bulldog
   her since she tends to be down on the ground or doing some crazy spinning crap  which will
   dodge high attacks. Her "Crazy Crap" is her best weapon. She has a lot of changeups, but not
   so much that you won't be able to learn them and block them consistently after a couple of
   matches. And you're best weapon after she's done is a Demon Sweep. It will mostly likely
   connect and knock her over onto her face. Whereupon you can run up to her as she's rolling 
   backwards and Can-Can Kick her, (since most Christie players really like to duck) or Corpse
   Thrust (d+1) which smacks the shiznick outta duckers.

   Now if only she just had her Crazy Crap. Unfortunately, she's got some mean standing moves.
   The first you must beware of is her Elbow Upper (d/f+2). Its a quick elbow to your
   mid-section that will smack your face if you're ducking and when connected will knock you flat
   on your back. If you got nailed, prepare to watch 40% of your energy go away. She's got a
   mean okizeme juggle from this. So be aware that if you're ducking, you're in dangerous territory. 
   Another of her standing moves is her surprisingly fast knee. Its a great poke with surprising
   speed and range. Another move to worry about is her Running Kick. I'm not sure about the
   input, but she sort of dashes forward and then throws out a    straight mid hitting right kick
   that hits for crazy damage. She uses this when you're rolling backwards off of a recovery which
   will hit guaranteed even though you're finished rolling and sort of standing. It's just one of
   those things that T4 programmers made that Christie users abuse. If you roll anywhere, it's to
   your side against Christie. She's got others when she's far away, but are easily faked out into
   whiffing. She basically likes to keep close and quickly go into crazy crap. You HAVE to learn
   these, since there's no real way to pressure her while she's on the ground or poking. Once
   she's finished throw out a Demon Sweep, or if you think she'll try to start another Crazy Crap
   String, then throw out a Can-Can Kicks. However, keep in mind, that these don't tend to launch.

   A last word, switch to Hwoarang. OMG, Christie gets raped by Hwoarang. His b+3, WS+4,4
   and d/b+4,4 rape her. Sound familiar? Especially the b+3. That kick hits her even though she's
   lying down or in her relaxed position, and for some reason, Christie is vulnerable to multiple
   b+3's. You just b+3, then run up and b+3 again and repeat. For some reason, Christie is more  
   vulnerable, perhaps because when she's lying down, the computer forces her to be in relaxed
   position rather than true lying down. I'm not sure and maybe I just fought crappy Christies,
   but this works everytime and I just laugh when people pick Christie now.

   In closing, Demon Sweeps after block Crazy Crap Strings and Can-Can Kick only when you
   ABSOLUTELY know she will commit to a brand new Crazy Crap String. Block high when she's
   standing, even if she's ducking, and Laser Series whiffed moves. Abuse Corpse Thrust (d+1)
   when running up to her while she rolling away ion the ground, if she's stuck rolling against
   into a wall, Corpse Thrust is guaranteed for serious damage.


*******
*12. Lei*
*******


   I'm sorry, but I gotta leave Lei for the next update. He's got some serious changeups and has
   a very complex gameplay. I know, because I'm learning Lei myself. Read Glenn's "Lei Wulong 
   Supercop Strategy Guide" FAQ to get an idea of how dangerous he is. I'll get around to Lei 
   eventually. I promise.


*********
*13. Kuma*
*********


   Two short things. Bulldogging works up to a certain extent on Kuma. Unfortunately, he has 
   the Bear Hammer (1,1,1) which can interrupt your Repeated Jab String attempts. In other
   words, he can pop this guaranteed combo (if the first hit connects), in between Jab String
   attempts. Especially in between 2,1 Alt Jab Strings. When he goes into Hunting Bear Stance,
   your safest bet is to block low then Rising Uppercut on blocked moves. He's vulnerable to
   long range fast mid hits. Hits like Spinning Heel (b+4). Otherwise, don't play Kuma any
   differently then you would play Law.


********
*14. Julia*
********


   Most of this comes from a guy who kindly e-mailed me Julia strats, Mikey O. Thanks dude.

   "First of all, let me start off by saying that MIC (i don't know if you keep up on the
   tournaments here in the US, but the tourney that Zaibatsu just held was won by a guy
   named MIC) comes to my arcade. Ever since Tekken Tag he's loved Julia and those damn        
   annoying elbows. Since he's the only really good Julia player i've gone up against, I'll tell
   you what I consider to be a tough Julia: POKE, POKE, AND POKE!! 1 jab, then the elbow,
   then maybe a duck jab, elbow, repeat, switch up into her G-Clef cannon (1~1) then mix up the
   ender between the 1 mid-hit finisher, or the 4,3 sweep, then launch-up kick (which if the sweep 
   connects, you will DEFINATELY get nailed by the 3, no questions asked). Likes to launch
   you with u/f+4, then go into the 4 or 5 hit elbow juggles which gets old after the first dozen
   times he does it. I haven't played him much in Tekken4, but from wasting countless dollars 
   rematching him, you have to do the exact same thing -- poke back. Block (or parry) the
   elbow, then duck jab before she can. It wears on their nerves real quick after the 3rd or 4th
   time you nail them, that's when they just get pissed and before you realize it you're already
   dead o_O  But usually just like you were saying with other characters who bulldog, they
   lose their temper and start slipping up, that's when you get your slim chances in to counter
   and strike back."

   All great. The only other things I'd add is to throw a EWHF (f,N,d,d/f+2) at the beginning of
   the match. Also, use the Kazama Fury on her during your bulldogging. She'll most likely block
   the last low kick if she's decent, so just stand back, let her whiff the duck poke or kick and then
   JF her. If she sidesteps, repeat the whole last bit with the regular d+2 ender. Julia needs to be
   in charge like Mikey O said, so this whole "custom string" will set the tone of the match in
   your favor and force her to go on the defensive, where I believe Julia is limited to few attacks.


**************
*15. A Final Say*
**************


   * In closing, nearly every single character can be bulldogged save for Ling, Christie and Lei.
   And if they can be bulldogged, Jin can own them through constantly repeating Jab Strings,
   Alt Jab Strings, switching up with Rear Thrust (2,4) and Kazama Fury (1,3,2,1,4) and Can-Can
   Kicks. All this will give the player a major headache. I find that Bryan can be hard to bulldog
   because of his special Parry manuever, but otherwise, you have nothing to fear from taking
   charge of a fight. And although Steve's parry is similiar, I find many Steve players to
   completely leave the Parry out of their game, which I think is very foolish. Your okizeme game
   is limited to three moves, Can-Can Kicks, Demon Sweeps and Corpse Thrusts. But its all you
   need. When nearby, Demon Sweep or Can-Can. If they're rolling away towards a wall, Corpse
   Thrust them (d+1). Switch up throws when they get up and you'll have one very frustrated
   opponent. Please read Kazama-Yama Boy Jin FAQ for more details.

   I hope this has been helpful for you guys. I'll always appreciate more strats on Ling and
   Christie, but everybody has trouble with these two hoes, (EXCEPT FOR HWOARANG ^_^).
   Thanks to the other Jin FAQ guy for inspiring layout of this FAQ. Thanks to Mikey O for
   his contribution. Thanks to Vale_Tudo_Freak for aptly describing "Jab and Grab." All this
   stuff except those previously mentioned is original, honest. I'm just a Korean-American with
   too much time on his hands, who hates to give up, and has access to an arcade where one
   credit is less than 10 cents. I love Korea.
