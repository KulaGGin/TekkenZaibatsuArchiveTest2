1. Introduction

The purpose of this "FAQ" is to put all of the information obtained by numerous 
tests and basically put all the results in one neat and tidy place. The JFLS seems 
to cause much confusion at the forums about what version can and cannot be 
sidestepped, blocked et cetera... So this is for clarification of all Jin newbie 
questions that otherwise flood our beloved forums.


2. Defense against the JFLS

First off, I am going to list all the possible variations, and/or scenarios that 
the JFLS can be used.

The basic b,f+2,1,d+2
The long charged Unblockable: b,f+2,1,D+2*
The First frame window release point of the Just Frame b,f+2,1:d+2
The Second frame window release point of the Just Frame b,f+2,1:d+2
All of the above with the first two hits being blocked.
All of the above with the first two hits connecting on normal hit.
All of the above with the first hit being a counter hit.


************************************************************************

The Basic: b,f+2,1,d+2

This is the normal laser scraper. No delay of the d+2.
-With the first two hits being blocked this version is sidestep able. If you block 
the first two hits of this simply hold up or down, whichever goes to the right, and 
you will side step this with no trouble at all.

-With the first two hits connecting on normal hit this version can't be side stepped 
but can be blocked. So, if you think the opponent is going to do this version and 
expect you to sidestep in anticipation of the just frame, simply block, or parry, etc...

-With the first hit being a counter hit this version is UNESCAPABLE, if the Jin player 
does not delay this at all, not matter how many of you think you can break the stun, 
you can't, your ass is getting launched. Period. However, if the Jin player even 
slightly delays any of the hits, this can be blocked easily.

************************************************************************

The Long Charged Unblockable: b,f+2,1,D+2*

-With the first two hits being blocked this move is a joke. You can do whatever you 
want in retaliation, sidestep, counter, etc...

-With the first two hits connecting on normal hit same rules apply as above. 

-With the first hit being a counter hit you can break the stun easily then do whatever 
you want.

************************************************************************

The First Frame Release Window of the Just Frame: b,f+2,1:d+2

This is probably the biggest reason of the whole jfls debate. Let's state this here, 
Jin's Just Frame Laser Scraper has 2, yes 2, release points. This is the quicker 
release point of the two. The easiest way to tell if you've done this version is the 
amount of "sparklies" that Jin's fist leaves. If you only see 2, or 3 little sparkly 
bubble things that fade away very quickly, you've done the first release point of the 
Just Frame. Anyway...

-With the first two hits being blocked this version, as with all versions can be 
sidestepped to the right.

-With the first two hits connecting on normal hit this version cannot be side stepped, 
blocked, parried, interrupted, reversed, or any other crap you want to try. It's 
impossible. You're going up.

-With the first hit being counter hit no good Jin player will ever do this version so 
just get prepared to be launched.

************************************************************************

The Second Frame Release window of the Just Frame: b,f+2,1:d+2

This version is actually like the third frame of the JF, not sure, but you can tell if 
you did this version, which mostly everyone does, by once again looking at the 
"sparklies" if there is around 7 or 8 bubbles that linger in the air for  a noticeably 
longer time than the other version.

-With the first two hits blocked this can be side stepped right by holding up or down, 
whichever is to the right.

-With the first two hits connecting on normal hit this version CAN be sidestepped. I 
don't however think you can side step this version by simply holding up or down, you 
have to sidestep at just the right time, but I might be wrong. 

-With the first hit being a counter see the aforementioned version.

Summary:
That's basically it. I hope this puts an end to all the questions and concerns anyone 
had about defending against the JFLS.

strat threads and don't make dumb threads about Jin and how overpowered he is. and 
also thanks to Kazuya Kazama for the insight on the 2 release points.
