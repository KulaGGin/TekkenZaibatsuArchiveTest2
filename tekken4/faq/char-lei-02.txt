1) LEGAL MATTERS
=================

This strategy guide is meant to be a free for all the Tekken players
worldwide and you may freely distribute this document without any
changes so long as it is for personal use.  Basically this whole
text document is (C) 2001 Glenn Ford.  To be brutally honest I don't
give a damn if you plagurise the hell out of it, but don't, there's 
really no point.  I've used other peoples stuff, and credited them
where I do.  The facts in this guide are from everyone, the 
opinions mine.

2) AUTHOR'S NOTE
=================

I've been playing Tekken since the original in the arcades and have
made Lei a favourite from two until four.  I got into Paul during 
Tag team, but being a PS player as a whole and not liking sticks 
I'm back on Lei with the advent of Tekken 4, since I still can't 
reliably do quarter circles with a stick (sad as that is).  I'm 
writing this because the guides I've seen so far have fallen a bit 
short of the mark, this guide is partly my own ideas, partly facts 
and partly an amalgamation of tactics from other people (all credited) 
that I think will cover the bases for newbie Lei players.  This is a 
lead in and should hopefully give people a base to build their own 
tactics on.  I make no excuses for the fact that a lot of this is 
borrowed from other people, what I want to do is make a FAQ that ties 
together all the possible Lei information out there, mine or other 
peoples, despite the above I don't really care if this gets ripped
off so long as we get a great FAQ out the end of it, just don't try
to sell it, and at least credit me.
What I mean by this is that I'll almost certainly canablise any Lei
FAQs I find shorter than this one, and I hope than any longer will
contain everything in this one.  My intent isn't to be recognised as
a Tekken authority, but to produce an immaculate FAQ.
All of this has been tripple checked on the PS2 version of Tag-Tekken 
with hit analysis and everything on for technical matters and tested 
in the heat of battle for usefulness.  Ninety percent of it has been 
tried on the arcade machine Tekken 4, but not all of it.  So if you 
spot anything wrong, please let me know right away.  I will review 
it if I get comments, but I hope this to be fairly good when its done 
anyway.

-Terms-

A few odd phrases I use you may not know:

'Wake up game' also known as 'Okizeme' I call it Wake up because
that's what I learnt it as and I can't always remember how to 
spell Okizeme.  Basically, attacking someone while they can neither
defend or retaliate, on the floor, defenseless.

'Juggle' hitting someone when they can neither defend or retaliate,
in mid air, defenseless.

'Eating' taking it on the chin, or shin, or whatever.  Basically
neither blocking a move nor taking it on counterhit.  Sometimes
done intentionally, if a position could lead to a low damaging 
low kick or a mid hitting juggle starter, most people will 'eat'
the low kick.

'Punk' also known as Pimping, when someone slaps you out of a move,
most often a roll, in some way that makes you step back and feel
that punch.

'Turtle' Someone who blocks constantly, often ducking into the 
bargain and often a Reversal master.

'Pitbull' Opposite of a Turtle, attacks you none stop.

'Masher' you can hear the buttons clattering, he might as well
have his eyes closed as he ham-fistedly slams into the buttons.
Gives Eddy/Christie (Capoaria) a bad name, kill him now.  A word, 
good Capoaria players tend to be very quiet, Masher Capoaria's like 
to trash talk you for some reason.  Hurt them all.

'Little Jimmy' Someone who knows about three moves because
he's not played before, certainly not in the Arcade, he
can't do quarter circles with a stick, why aren't the buttons
linked?  That didn't use to happen in Tekken 3 did it?
Not really his fault.  Best to go easy on these sorts because 
they will learn eventually, and they should be encouraged to do
so.

'Scrub' Masher/Little Jimmy catch all.  Someone you know you
can beat before you even touch the buttons.

'Custom String' a set of pokes, attacks, throws, stance changes
and such that smoothly link together with pauses and range
changes that confuse and batter your opponent.

'Points' in various places I'll refer to juggles or moves
doing points of damage, or amounts.  Each move does an amount
of damage in points, the damage points a character has.  On 
average a character can take around a hundred points of damage.

'Wiff' miss, fall short or go over someone's head.  A move that
never even connects is a wiffed move.

-Hit ranges-

l - Low hit
L - Low hit also striking ground
m - Mid hit
M - Mid hit also striking ground
h - High hit
! - unblockable
G - ground hit

==================
4) LEI IN GENERAL
==================

Lei is probably one of the most varied and all round able fighters
in Tekken.  He's often seen as a gimmick fighter with the stance
changes and his lying or back turned fighter, but with the growing
number of fighters with strange stances through to Tekken four this
is dying off.  From Tekken Tag and moreso in Tekken four all 
the fighers are however able and powerful to a high level, without
exception, the secret is no longer to picking the right person, but
to understanding who you pick.

To this end, Lei can cover probably every single base in fighting to 
a certain degree.  Juggles, wake-up (Okizeme), confusion, 
sidestepping, poking and throwing are all games where he has some 
ability.  At no point is his game really weak.  His single greatest 
strength is in his ability to chain pressure custom strings almost 
without pause.

Character wise Lei is more like a cross of Hwoarang, with his stance
chaining abilities, and Law, with his striking and wake-up game, but 
a little more.

Lei is, in the end, very stylish, and he should be played as such.  
Most decent players have seen all his stances a thousand times,
but when you advance on someone with dragon stance, or stand back
in pheonix illusion, even the best will be caught for a second
trying to figure out exactly what you're going to do.  In a Tekken
match half the war is working out what your opponent likes to do
from certain set-ups, with Lei you need never repeat the same
set-up twice, but at the same time, you can, and train opponents
to react to him.  This is, of course, what differentiates a good
player from a great one, training your opponent, more will be 
included on that later.  The point to Lei here is that you should
strive to have enough custom strings to include all his stances
at one point or another, if you rely on knowing one or two you will
never get the best out of Lei.

Lei has the basic poking and striking power to let you get into
understanding him a step at a time, but until you get the hold 
of all his stances and using all of them in a bout you'll never
really know him.  Some people will consider Lei cheap, he's got
nasty string mix-up and you don't have to learn strong juggles
to win with him.  I won't get too into this, but I think its crap.
Personally I think a bar destroying juggle, however hard to do
is no less cheap than a well thought out pressure and poking game.
I also find a constantly stance switching unpredictable fast
thinking opponent training Lei to be as if not more stylish than
a massed wave dashing super juggler, but that's just me.
There are cheap strats, but in my opinion they don't work.  I
think there is no such thing as a cheap or cheesy strat that
will consistently beat a good player.

5) MOVELIST
=============

Other than some appearance changes these are almost ninety nine
percent lifted from Catlord's FAQ.  I believe that giving him
credit makes doing that okay, if not I'll deleate it all and
type it out again for the next version.  Catlord's FAQ is just
the best for movelists, so I didn't see any point re-doing it.
I've also tagged on a few extra facts I thought were useful
of my own and corrected one or two minor things.  I haven't 
asked for permission prior to doing any of this, because I 
didn't think it mattered, but if it did do tell me.

As such, and by Catlord's convention, new moves for Tekken 4
are in capitals.

6) MOVE ANALYSIS
=================

In this section I'm going to talk about most of Lei's moves and 
some of his more interesting options.  I'll rate the moves from one 
to five, five being a necessary part of the arsenal, one being next 
to useless.  I'm going to mention every move that has a specific use 
to be aware of, which with Lei is most of them.  Unlike some 
fighters he has very few totally useless moves.

---------------------------------------------------------------------


Throws:
-------

Of all Lei's areas his throwing is probably his weakest, having only
three special throws and the normal set of basic throws, for this
reason it seems most Lei FAQs and players ignore his throwing game.
Which is probably part of what can make it so dangerous as a set up.  
If used carefully his throw game can be strong, his simple throw set
gives him good options despite its limits, and who wants a load of
throws when only a few really work well?
His simple but effective throws belie the idea of Lei's weak 
throwing game.  Especially since its such an accepted fact that Lei 
doesn't throw much these will keep people off balance, and if 
there's one thing you want with Lei its to keep people off 
balance.

Double foot stomp/Flying Sky Kick F+2+4 {2}           Rating: 2

The best of Lei's basic throws and probably the best basic throw in 
game, at least equal to any other.  Its real benefit is that after
the throw Lei backflips away leaving Lei at perfect shoulder barge
range.  Its nature as a basic throw and so one button escape keeps
its rating low, but if you do manage to pull it off then the benefit
of the extra space is obvious.  Running at a downed opponent is a
serious advantage, usually leading to a stomp or sometimes a shoulder
barge, but be ready for the low kick if the opponent rolls well.

Sleeper Hold 2+4 {2}                                  Rating: 1

With the loss of different button escapes for the different basic
throws this throw has lost its use.  You can use it for the wake-up
options it leads to since it leaves your opponent at your feet.
But realistically the Sky Kick has better options and should always
be used, or the Thai Trip has the same wake up options of the Sleeper,
but with a double button escape.

Thai Trip/Tripping f,F+1+2 {1+2}                      Rating: 3

Double button escape, good grab range and decent, though not great
damage make this one of Lei's most important throws.  It should be
mixed into standing strings.  It doesn't come out wicked fast, but 
in Tekken 4 few throws really seem to, always hit your wake-up
options after for extra damage.

Falling Elbow Trip/Dragon Falls U/F+1+2 {1+2}         Rating: 4

Lei's best throw, his most damaging, still a fairly piddly amount of
damage, but his best all the same.  Plus it leaves him in his slide
position, FD/FA, meaning his slide, 4~3 is pretty much definate,
follow it with the first half of the Rave spin, since the slide 
will leave you FU/FA for the sweep and you have a fairly serious 
piece of damage, about fifty or sixty, especially if the sweep 
strikes clean, which it often does.  Not to be overused since 
standing and blocking low can save the opponent, or even often by 
rising low attacking, but once or twice its a lot of damage from a 
simple throw.  Those of you with crappy arcade sticks, note the 
diagonal in the execution though, sorry.  
If your opponent is prone to getting up and standing though don't 
be afraid to tag on the whole of the Rave Spin on the end of that,
since it will catch him as he stands or if he rolls, only once mind.  
If the opponent likes to rise with a standing attack stay down and 
pop him up with a kangeroo kick after the slide for a free juggle 
set, or whatever is your personal favourite from FU/FA, more on 
that position later.

Out of Control/Neck Ringer/Drunken Throw              Rating: 3

This one can be done from Snake stance or from Dragon stance.  Both
have fairly slow animation and normally this is a show of throw, but 
it has uses.  This gets its high rating because its a different 
button escape and Lei has so few throws, plus it can leave you in 
another stance, and we always want to switch stances with Lei.  Doing 
the throw from Snake (SK, 1+3) can have a neat side effect.  You 
can't normally side step and attack out of animal stances, leaving 
Lei open to power attacks he has to give up priority to.  If you time 
this right though Lei will sidestep and instantly throw giving you 
his side throw instead of the Drunken Throw, if your caught at a 
distance in Snake and have a Deathfist happy Paul or some such it can 
be an option, if a tricky to pull off one.  Big style points though.
From Dragon stance the throw is a little slow to say the least, but 
it is a neat mix-up.  It works like this, most veterans will probably 
be expecting a strike from here and most newbies the throw, so switch 
up, train them one way or another and then suddenly switch back.  
More on this in the stances section.  If you do get the move off take 
advantage of the Swill every so often (1+2) not for the energy it 
gives, since you lose damage from the throw it all counts equal in 
the end unless you're on some sort of survival thing, but because you 
can come out from the throw in drunken stance, which is confusing and 
can lead to a drop down and more confusion and so on.  Overall this 
is an extra option from the potentially limited animal stances and 
should be noted for that.


Striking Arts:
--------------

These are the various attacks Lei has while standing and not in any 
stance.  You should probably be thinking about switching into one of 
the other stances from this position, not a straight switch, but a 
move that leads into them, this is the way to keep Lei flowing and 
in constant pressure mode.  Also, many of your best guessing game 
options, the strongest part of Lei's game, come from his animal 
stances.  His pressure is better in basic stance, but many top 
players have learnt to handle pressure.  Your two best options from 
here are a move that ends in another stance or your hopkick or other 
juggle starter, but there are other tricks.

Basic Moves:
-------------

Basic moves that everyone, or at least many people, possess, but you
should be aware of the qualities of for various reasons.

Lifting Uppercut d/f+2 *Juggles*                      Rating: 4

Lots of people have the lifting uppercut to juggle, this is both more
and less important to Lei than them.  Firstly, Lei has more juggle
starters than almost anyone else, with the kangeroo kick, the Panther
Paw, Tiger Claw, Crane Dance, Crane hopkick, Rave sweep, Tiger Sweep,
and others, so this isn't too important for him.  The Panther Paw
and sprial uppercut have the same juggle properties as this but 
better mix-ups.  However, Lei has no while standing uppercut juggle
which most people have, and only this as a mid striking, normal 
stance, standing juggle, which makes it important to remember.  Its
safer than the boot on recovery and has good damage chances.  You 
should include it in your custom poking strings to catch an opponent
who's blocking is slow, though when you get an opening the hopkick
triggers at about the same speed and has high damage follow-ups.  You 
can catch a whole razor rush juggle off this, the snake punches, the 
cresent kick, the rolling kicks or the turning punch spiral uppercut 
all connect.  The rolling kicks are the most damaging, but the point 
is you can end up in any single stance you choose after this move, 
its a perfect poke breaker and leaves your opponent confused and in 
trouble since you can end it never the same way twice on connection.

Jumping Boot/Hopkick u/f+4 *Juggles*                  Rating: 5

Pretty much Lei's best juggle starter, its like any other hop
kick really, which for those of you who don't know means its fast and 
high, not realy much else to say about it, it doesn't have much mix-
up or anything, its just a good, fast, mid-striking juggle starter.  
Most of Lei's game is based on mix-up, but this is the sort of move
you're looking to find an opening for so you can really pile on the 
damage.

Knockdown Highkick CH 4 *Juggles*                    Rating: 2

You can just about land the first two kicks of the rolling
kicks on this for the juggle, but that's about it.  You have
to know its going to land counter to get that off, in which
case there are better moves to land.  Not all players can juggle
of the basic high kick, so if it lands be ready to tack on those
rolling kicks for a few more points.

RUNUP BACKFLIP		b,b~u/b (BK) *Against Wall*	Rating: 1

The general turn around move everyone has from the wall, a little
slow, takes a lot of space, and hard to do, I'm not totally 
certain what you'd do with this.  It will never be a good way
to get back turned, I can only think of luring someone into 
this and getting behind them.

Rising Mid Kick ws+3                                  Rating: 2

Lei has practically no moves from out of a crouch, he has no full 
crouch moves and no while standing moves to speak of.  This is 
the one clear deficiency in Lei's all around game, he's just not
good fighting from out of a crouched cramped position, he prefers to 
be streched out in one way or another.  As such this move is 
important to bear in mind.  Firstly because its his best while
standing move, hitting mid and fast with good range, to get you back
to your feet, but secondly, if you do the Rave Sweep from lying down
(mentioned later) then following up with the Rave Spin is very slow 
and dangerous, this move is a little bit of a better option.
Primarily here to remind you to be aware of Lei's weaknesses, this 
move does have its uses.

Low Jab d+1                                          Rating: 3

Once again, Lei is not great out of a crouch, and the new addition
of the snake punches and one two punch for Lei, I suspect, are there
to protect that fact.  Let me explain.  The fastest move in the game
is the low jab (d+1), alternate low jab (d+2) or modified low jab 
(d/b+1).  As such this is the move of choice for knocking people out
of moves as they attack.  Now, everyone else has while standing moves
from this, usually ones that juggle, Lei has practically nothing, 
certainly nothing that juggles.  I suspect that giving him his new
lightning fast standing punches are a way of making up for this
deficiency.  However, the low jab is still the weapon of choice
for knocking people out of moves.  If you know that they won't be 
going under the height of your one two punches or snake punches, then
use them, but if you're not sure and you need to stuff an incomming
attack, then this is the move to use.  The Low Jab is simply the 
fastest move you have at your disposal, and the most likely to knock
people out of a move.  Whenever popping someone out a move is 
mentioned, this is almost always the move assumed to be doing the 
work.  As a rule, a protection move, but one worth remembering.


Pokes:
-------

These are all Lei's quick in close punching attacks, the ones that 
you should use if you get into a poke war.  Pokes are short fast 
attacks that you use to pressure an opponent and punish slow recovery 
moves, anything quick with low recovery is pretty much a poke, as a 
rule, any basic punch.  The listed here are Lei's most interesting 
ones and their properties.  Lei can't beat Nina, Law or King in a 
straight poke war but he can take most people, and almost every one 
of his pokes has a stance switch avaliable, so even the proffesional 
pokers can be taken down.  In a poking war be aware that Lei's real 
aim is to get out of it.  He can poke with the best of them, but its 
not his area.  What he really wants is a few good pokes then a 
situation that will give him distance and slow the fight down, or at 
least allow him to pace it.  This is exactly what stance switch moves 
allow him to do.
The basic idea to pokes is to interrupt slow initiating attacks or 
punish slow recovery ones and set-up longer attacks.  For Lei, it 
also to control the range of the game and to make room for his many
set-ups.


DOUBLE SNAKE JABS 1,1 [F - SK]                        Rating: 2

A new Lei move that comes out fast and leaves him in Snake stance.  
Its a good idea to take the stance change ninety percent of the time 
because the Snake offers some nasty mix ups.  A weak poke but with 
fairly safe stance mix-up, and very very fast.

Wonder why this is here.  No stance leave off, not huge punishment, 
strike range high, if you must mix this in a custom string, but as 
a whole use the snake jabs in any situation you feel compelled to 
pull this out in.  A potential panic button, but the Snake jabs 
are better despite the lesser damage.  Quick, but just no reason to
use them.  I would include these in the basic moves, but Lei's 
one two punches are quicker than most peoples, and look a lot
different.  Still, not a useful move.

Drunken Tiger Lash/Drunken punch b+1 [f-drunken stance] Rating: 2

Not as good as either the Drunken punch from Drunken stance, which 
hits mid and has greater knock back, nor the Drunken Punches from 
sidestep.  The only real use is the rear back to go under a high 
punch and get a counter.  But then you should just go with the 
cannonball headbutt which has more damage and rears back just the 
same, plus has better guard stun and mix-up.  Of course, you could 
go into drunken stance from it, but you can from the drunken punches, 
and if you connect the opponent will be on the floor knocked away, 
in which case you don't want to be in drunken stance.  One to avoid 
really.
I hate to say that any move is useless, so coming back to this I've 
noticed a possible use.  You have long enough to hit the Tiger Sip 
from this move on counter-hit thanks to its knock back.  With the
health plus to you this gives the equivilent of forty five points
of damage off one move given that the rear back gains you your 
counter-hit.  You get no follow up option thanks to the Drunken 
Stance and the distance, but its something to note.

Drunken punches SS+2,2 [f - drunken stance]             Rating: 3

Sidesteps, hits mid then high, goes into drunken stance, second hit 
is garenteed on counterhit, this is a nice little move.  If blocked 
the second hit causes guard stun and the first strike hits rolling 
opponents.  If you get it on counter and go drunken Lei will rear 
back too far to hit until the opponent gets up and attacks, so 
either keep the stance going and double foot kick him when he gets 
in range or don't go drunken.  Best option here is to sidestep an 
attack, claim your free damage and go into wake up.  Good for 
quick recovery moves you can sidestep and a hopkick won't work for.  
Probably the second best way to go into drunken stance to play that 
guessing game with your opponent.  When you think a side throw will 
be broken and you want a quick side attack, this is your man.  You 
can then go into either Drunken stance guessing game or wake-up 
guessing game, you're in control.

Hits high and does less damage than the drunken punches, if you're
using this you better be planning to go into the animal stances.
That said, this is probably the best way to get into Tiger stance
and gets its rating for that alone really.  The only other way 
to get into Tiger is to stance change from the Razor Rush where 
punch four is kind of in no-man's land.  The Tiger stance has 
some juicy possibilities so its worth getting into.  If you 
don't intend to use it leave this alone though, the punch itself 
is worse than the Drunken punches, hop kicks, throws or any other 
sidestep options.  You gan get into Dragon stance from the Razor 
rush fairly easily too, but its a weak animal stance anyway and 
you shouldn't be making such an effort to get into it, only use 
it if it comes naturally in a custom string.

Lightning fast decent damage and leaves you in one of the two best
animal stances, if it didn't strike double high it would have a
rating of five.  Lei's aim in poking wars is to break out from 
the war and slow things to his pace, this move is perfect for that.
It's insanely fast and leaves you in one of the two most unusual
stances, most likely to have your opponent react in surprise if
he doesn't know them and fear if he does.  Use this one in custom
strings a fair amount, it yeilds good results.

Turning punch 1+2 [bk]                                Rating: 2
Spinning Hook Punch ~1 [bk]
Spiral Uppercut ~2

The move itself is not great at all, it hits high and isn't too
quick, its power is its follow-ups and surprisingly high damage.  
There are a whole mass of ways to get Lei backturned and this is not 
the best one, most people will block it and punish you, its one 
saving grace is the Spiral Uppercut which can be used to
protect it.  The hook spin back blow is only of use in juggles.
It is, however, a lot of use in juggles, it does massive damage,
either with the hook spinning blow or the hook uppercut.  Just
never do the turning punch to spinning hook punch on a standing
opponent since even if it connects first all the opponent has to 
do is hold back and it'll block, worse, both hit high.  If the 
first punch connects go with the Spiral Uppercut or stay back
turned.  The Spiral will at least force blocking, though 
playing back turned is better.  If the first punch blocks stay
backturned, a hook punch will get ducked normally and no matter 
what the opponent does blocking the first punch will cause the 
Spiral to auto wiff him and lead to a big follow up.
If its in a juggle though, throw them both out and make the opponent
eat mass damage.

Spiral Uppercut [bk] 2 *Juggles*                      Rating: 3 

If you're back turned you can do the spiral uppercut, but its
here because you can chain it off the turning punch.  If you
hit and hold 1, then double tap 2 you'll get the turning punch
spiral uppercut instantly.  The uses for this are many, they'll
be gone over in the back turned section, but you should use it
when people expect a low attack from you and when they rush in
on the turning punch to pop them up.  It will be gone over later.


General strikes:
----------------

A few words on his strikes that don't fit into other categories.

Headbutt/Cannonball b+1+2                             Rating: 3

A good strong Lei attack this, it has bad recovery if it wiffs,
but it has good knock back on counter and the rear back is
a gift when you know a long high string is coming.  Plus, a neat
trick can be to put in one, then if its blocked pull out another
right away, most opponents will go for a high attack to punish 
the recovery time and you can catch them with the second headbutt
on counter.  When well used this can be a brutal attack thanks to
its power, its mid striking and its avoidance capability.
On none counter hit it does cause knee stagger, but it isn't 
enough to use for anything.

Elbow Drop/Falling Tree (u/f_u/b)+2 (FU,FA)          Rating: 3

With Lei it is vital to be aware of every stance switching move
you have.  The elbow drop is not only a powerful wake up tool
it leaves you in a new stance, its better to naturally be in 
your next stance than drop into it artificially, so using this
in your wake-up games should be second nature.  Not only that,
but because Lei jumps up to do it and it strike mid it can
be used in custom strings.  The jump will avoid low attacks and
striking mid this can be used for people who duck and pop out
low attacks at you or for predictable slow execution low attacks
as a stylish if risky attack option to moves like Byran's Snake
edge or Law's Dragon Tail.  Be warned that even on counter hit
the other person will recover before you, so be careful using it
on standing opponents.  An important wake-up, custom string 
and stance changing tool this one should be remembered, also, 
it looks stupid, so lots of people write it off, that means 
that it gives you the element of surprise when you use it, 
especially on standing opponents.  

Crescent, Low Sweepkick f_N_b+3,3 (BK)                 Rating: 3

Yes the best players have seen them a million times, yes 
you'll get blocked and punked out if you over use it, but
also, yes if you get it on counter you've got a seventy
point damage combo guarenteed, and that just can't be 
ignored.  Plus, again, it leaves you back turned, which
we have to like.  Add to that the fact that many times
you can pass up a long juggle and just whack out the
Crescent kick and get almost as much damage from it this
simple kick's options cannot be ignored.  The direction
held will make Lei step during the sequence, which has
obvious uses.
If you land it on counter follow up with the low kick and
the Rave sweep, all will connect and you can come out into
Snake stance, don't do the full Rave Spin though, it won't
land.  If you don't connect with the first kick do not 
follow up unless your opponent is either too far away to
matter and you're using it to back turn, on the floor 
and your using it for wake-up or your opponent is a gimp
because it will get blocked and you will be punished.
A neat wake-up option is when the opponent is on the floor
go and do the Crescent over his head, occasionally he'll
think you fouled up and go for the rising strike, in which
case the low kick will set him back on the floor with you
back-turned and ready to Rave sweep or low hook punch him.

The Axis shifting version is so weird as to be practically 
useless, but the normal version does have a few tricks up its
sleeve.  It is slow, so use it from a way off and let them
see it coming.  Paul will Deathfist you and King will catch
it but most other people will just block it since its such
obvious chicken bait plus once one is blocked the Guard Stun
means you have to block the whole lot.  Also most people expect 
to see either one or three of them, so stopping on the second 
to either a low back turned attack or dropping down can yeild
results, the first since you tend to catch people blocking high
the second since you'll get a few seconds of the person working
out what just happened to hit them.  If you're in a long match
do this once or twice, then the next time hit all three and watch
as the mid kick takes their ducking heads off.  Most useful from
Pheonix Illusion, outlined later.

This is a vital Lei move for ending juggles.  On standing 
opponents final kick will almost always get itself blocked, 
and the juggle capability is fairly limited, you can get a 
certain low kick off it, but that's about it.  You should use 
the last kick only if you want to get face down really, or 
within juggles, especially since it can be reversed.  This 
is a move that covers a deceptive amount of well distance, 
over two backdashes length, the ankle kicks can be used to
chip away at health while leaving you fairly safe on the floor.
All around a basic Lei tool that everyone should know, not a 
devestating move, but a vital one.

                                                     Rating: 2

Not as good as from the already backturned postion.  Catlord's
original FAQ lists three possible flips as possible from the
sidestep, but in my experience this is untrue, only one, the
Falling Blade, can be done from Sidestep and three can be chained
in the Flip Flop Flip from Back-turned, I may be wrong since
I am often a ham fisted oaf, but I don't think I am this time.  
This will hit grounded opponents and really its only use I think
is for wake-up.  It is useful there though, since it leaves you
backturned and in the position to play the low hooks/uppercut/
rave spin game with your opponent and is moderatly quick.  Not
huge damage, but it is a mid-striking ground striking move, which
is rare and leaves you backturned, so it has its uses.  Save for
clever wake-up, outlined later.

Another of Lei's big range attacks that leaves him on the floor.
Strike mid and goes a long way so it can potentially be used to
surprise ducking turtles, but it has more uses from the floor.  
Worth being aware of as an option, but more important uses from
the ground that will be discussed later.

Rave Spin 4                                           Rating: 2

Lei does not have many diagonal commands, this and the uppercut
are really the only ones worth the effort, but this is a 
necessary part of Lei's arsenal.  It has great range, good 
damage, floats and goes into the snake stance.  You have to use 
it in wake-up game, you need it for Christie, and can even get 
a semi juggle into snake just by doing it twice in a row.  You 
need to know the Rave Sweep and use it a lot, its as simple as 
that.  The only downside to the Sweep is that if its blocked it 
causes Lei stumble, but really the range and its use as a 
wake-up attack should mean you don't get it blocked, 
especially if you're being as unpredictable as Lei should.
The Rave Spin is not as good.  If you catch someone rolling up
from the floor with the Sweep then the Spin will juggle and
cause some free damage, but just don't try it on a standing 
opponent apart from as Chicken Bait, since it will be reversed.  
If you connect with the Sweep then the Spin is certain, but 
since a double sweep into snake does almost as much damage and 
leaves you with more options its a better choice, or the Rave
Spin into Snake stance and snake strikes does more damage than 
the spin don't do it.  Plus if the sweep doesn't land then 
they'll kill you on the spin.  Reserve the Spin for occasional
wake-up and idiots.  It's safer on people without reversals, 
but even then it goes high and has nasty recovery if blocked, 
so just try to avoid it.

CRANE HOPKICK/Soaring Crane Wing
            u/b_u_u/f+3 (Crance Stance)  *Juggles*   Rating: 3

A new Lei move for Tekken 4 and to be honest I'm yet to get
full use out of this juggle, so anyone with ideas be sure to
drop them off to me.  Crane stance is one of the most useful 
animal stances for reasons outlined below and I tend to use
this move right now as a way to get into it.  The rating right
now is a potential one, I've managed to land a few hits of the
Crane dance off it, but I don't know what is certain or not,
so expect updates.  
Okay, on second look, its a little slow since before doing it
Lei sort of jiggles his leg into a semi karate kid crane kick.
It certainly juggles into the Crane dance, which means that
slow though it may be its the starter to the coolest juggle 
in the game.  Since this is the only juggle starter that allows
you to animal stance juggle it is your duty to use it at least
once each round, also the juggle is pretty easy and powerful.
A good move, and gets a ton of style points.

LEAPING TWISTKICK, 	u/f+3+4 [4] (BK) [Twistkick]	Rating: 2

Not a great move by any means.  Lei sort of back flips, striking
down with both feet.  Its very very slow to come out and it 
just won't come out in close range.  Its one use is if you're at
long range and you want to move towards your opponent a long way
and turn your back, which isn't a terrible thing.  It will get
blocked most the time, so use it then go into a low/mid backturned
guessing game with your low punches and uppercut.  Do not use this 
close in, ever, it won't get close to coming out.  If anyone has
spotted a great use for this, tell me.
Okay, I've had an E-mail from a guy called Eric Janson who suggests 
hitting the Leaping Twistkick immediatly after a completed rave spin
(d/b+4,4) since this will connect with anyone who tries to get up.
I tend not to complete Rave Spins any more, but if you do this sounds
like a great idea, mix it up with a second rave spin which will strike 
grounded, forcing your opponent to guess some.

BACKFLIP/Blade Drop	b+4 (f) (Crane Stance)        Rating: 3

Good avoidance move, fast, gives plenty of space, and yet another
way to get into the Crane Stance.  There are rather a lot of
ways to get into Crane now really, they've been adding them none
stop since Tekken three and this one is a little much now, but
not without uses.  Really best to mix in with backturning backdashes 
for dashing away mix up, with this, the normal dashes and the Ha 
Ha step (Below) you can dash back healthy distances and end up 
in not only backturned, face first, but also Crane now, so good 
for that.  Keep it in mind for your general movement play.
On second look I've given this an extra point since you can indeed
hit with it.  Best on the bigger players like Craig or Kuma, but
if they're battering at you then throw this out, it comes out 
very fast and hits mid, leaving you at long range.  It even looks 
like you might be able to catch a rolling kick off it to a slight 
juggle, but that's just a guess.  With the Twist Kick, a long range
move that leaves you close and this, a short range move that leaves
you long Lei's been given two new moves clearly meant to compliment 
each other, and with a chance for new stance changing, ways to 
control the range and pace of the match.


The Rush:
----------------

Ahhh, the Rush.  This is a must know, must part of Lei's 
me.  The Rush gives easy safe pressu  Yoe, its hits can 
be staggered, it can end at different hit ranges, can 
be mixed up itself and can be broken out into animal 
stances.  Its also a central tool to Lei's main juggles.
Lei's standing game should be based around the Rush and its
almost infinite possibilities.  Never become predictable
with the Rush, never let your opponent to cease fearing it.
Basically, the Rush is when you tap forward and then leave
the stick neutral, Lei will do an odd little walk, this is,
for want of a better term, the Rush walk.  From it you can
perform multiple attacks enough that it is, really, a
stance in its own right.

           3/>4 [u_d]   Sweeping Kick/Midkick [Crane Stance]

The Razor Rush.  From this every single Lei animal stance can 
be reached.  If your opponent has no mid reversal then feel
free to constantly pressure them with this, especially since
the avaliablity of staggering the punches means that striking
between punches is suicide and at the end the opponent has to
guess either low or mid for the block.  It might be a little
cheap, but its more important to use it to teach your opponent
to fear the Razor.  That might sound odd, but the Razor will
form a central part of any good Lei offence, so you should 
establish it in your opponents mind as a serious weapon not
to be trifled with.  You can of course switch out to animal
stances, and should in various occasions, including juggles
(discussed below).  The Razor is also vital in Lei's best
juggles, so you should be used to doing it at will.  Note
that you cannot go to Crane stance from the low kick.  Also,
this might be me, but I've found that if punches two, three
or four land on counter hit changing to animal stance out 
of them becomes harder.  I'd like feedback on this to see
if its just me.  Rushing for safe pressure, closing ground,
mix-up, juggling and even Chicken baiting is a vital Lei
part of his game.  If the first few punches wiff look out
for long range low attacks, but other than that the Razor
with careful staggering and rushing is a perfect attacking
pressure tool that let you control the pace of the fight.
Try to judge your opponent when using the rush.  If you
stance switch and he low jabs out out of it, you have 
two choices, one, stop stance switching.  You can then
either carry through to the mid-low kick, which is a 
neat guessing game, but be wary of low parries and 
reversals, or you can just cut the rush short and stop,
normally your opponent will take half a second to react
then attack, hopefully right into a fresh rush or uppercut.
On the kicking game, some people without reversals will just
eat the low kick rather than get the knock down from the
mid kick.  If they do, then just let them eat it.  Your 
other option is to switch out into the Panther stance
and hold forward, his low jab will be auto parried by 
Panther stance and you get a free hop kick on him for
daring to mess with your stances.
When you stagger your punches, note what your opponent
does.  You can trick people into thinking that you're 
breaking off, stopping or fouling up and they will
often attack, and get popped.  If he just holds back 
through the whole sequence, staggered or not, break 
off into stances constantly and surprise him with 
low attacks, the Tiger's Tail low striking juggle 
starter is a favourite for that.  If he persists in his
delusion that there's time to poke inbetween staggered rushes
(There isn't) then start actually cutting off the Rush
and throwing out an uppercut.  If he can get popped by a
staggered rush he'll walk into the uppercut with his attack and 
get nice and juggled for his poor judgement.
On top of all this, the introductions of walls has increased the
power of the Rush, punch rushing someone up against the wall
is the simplest use of the new walls that we're all trying
to get to grips with.

          ,3/4 [u_d] Low Kick/Mid Kick [Crane Stance]

This is a fairly funny set of punches, but it has a lot of options.
First of all, what happens.  Lei throws out a punch from the Rush
walk that causes severe guard stun if blocked.  If it is blocked
you can go into the guard Melting punches then the second punch
of the sequence can only be blocked, no matter what the opponent
does, even if he tries to get it to connect, so essentially neither
of the first two punches can do damage for this to work, the second
punch is listed as twelve damage, but I've never seen it land.  The 
third hit is an uppercut that if the opponent does anything but block 
on will juggle him, the final hit will, if blocked, leave Lei back 
turned, if eaten will fling the opponent back.  If the first hit is 
not blocked then the last few punches and normal kick finish of the 
normal Razor Rush can be performed with all the usual effects
apart from that you cannot stance change on the punches.
The defence breaker really has to have the opponent blocking
if you land the first punch and hands priority right over to you.
There is no reason in the world to stop on the first guard melting
punch.  It can be a good idea to break off on the second and then
land the Dragon Falls throw, when your opponent learns that you
like to do that he'll probably start blocking low as soon as he can,
so hop kick him and juggle like you know you can.  If he does 
anything but block the third hit you have a juggle to take
advantage of.  Its probably not a good idea to break off on the 
third punch if its blocked, go through to the fourth where you
have decent advantage from the guard stun.  Go for the low swinging 
punches, five swinging punches should connect in a simple juggle, 
or have other options outlined later.  Plus they leave
you backturned so you can snatch him with a Rave Sweep from
backturned and be in Snake to move on, and the five low punch
juggle irritates the hell out of opponents, you can often hear 
them sigh when it happens, which I love personally, but I'm a bitch.  
If he starts regularly ducking then go for a turning hop kick, 
the extra second of ducking from the guard stun will let your hop 
kick connect and you can juggle away at your by now probably deeply 
irritated opponent.
As for the first hit not being blocked, then you go through the
sequence, make them guess your punch staggering and nail them
with the mid low kick guess then go into Crane if you like.
Note that since you can't stance switch if you're up against
someone with reversals, especially Bryan or Law be sure to
stagger the punches on and off.
Another great use of the guard melting punches is that the last
punch if blocked not only leaves you back turned, but it leaves 
you PAST YOUR OPPONENT.  So if you're back to a wall, throw out
the guard melters, if they block go through with it and you'll
be out the corner, back turned to them and with any luck they'll 
be back to the wall.  If they don't block, go to the punch rush
and fight your way out the corner.  Its a win win situation.
Unless they reverse the punch, but never mind that.

      Crescent Kick, 3 Punches [Low Kick/Mid Kick (Crane)]

Personally I don't really see a reason to use this one.  
It shouldn't really be in here, its not a real Rush move,
but it looks like one.  The Crescent goes high, you can't
stance switch, the only real thing to go for here is the
guessing game on the end of the move.  The Crescent takes 
a while coming out and you'll get ducked and juggled a lot
on this move.  If you want to play the mid/low game do it
with punch rushes.
For that matter, there's no reason not to do the true 
crescent rush, below, instead of this.  I mean, no reason
at all, none.  Unless you're such a rampant moron you 
can't do f,N, in which case give up on Lei now.  No, the 
true rush below is just better, don't do this move.

A complex looking set of moves with good options.  This 
was a good set of moves back in Tekken Tag but oddly
the new moves have reduced its power.
The Lightning Crescent and follow-up, either mid or low,
can make a neat game, but you can get punked on the 
overlong pause between  Crescent and follow-up so it 
shouldn't be over tested.
Having said that, other people love this move, so I'll
explain it fully.  Off either Lighting Crescent you can
go mid or low.  Now, in my experience I get punked before
the Lightning Crescent comes out, punked on the pause
before the low/mid kick or blocked on the horribly 
telegraphed last kick, but if none of this is happening,
this is what you can do.  The mid kick stuns without 
counter hit, letting you have a free hop kick to juggle.
If the low kick connects you can do the rolling kicks
and normally get all three kicks off.  If you manage
to land it or insist on using it, those are your options.
An old trick that has been pretty much lost was that people 
know that the Lightning Crescent goes high and follows on 
the Rush Combo so stopping and landing an uppercut to 
juggle would work well.  As said above the new moves have
lost this.  The big trick now is to switch up the mid
striking Snake punch and the low rolling kicks.  Use the 
mix-up and come from it with the stance switches to animal 
or lying down.  They're fairly safe pokes though not 
damaging, a safe way to switch stances and potentially
cause damage.  
The rolling kicks cause only seven points of damage, so
the only really good reason to do it is to train the 
opponent to block low so you can land the mid snake bite.  
If you break off into Dragon stance then you can catch 
your opponent ducking for the last Snake Punch and 
knock him with the Dragon Spark into Tiger.  The 
Snakes are hard to reverse so its fairly safe.  The 
low bite does fifteen points and the Spark twenty five 
so its probably the best option.  You can also go through to 
Panther stance which has a bunch of moves that will be 
outlined later.  Basically, the best option is the Snake 
strikes, and alternate going to Panther stance or break off 
and use Dragon into Tiger, but there are other options.

Not an attack, not even listed in Lei's normal move lists,
this is more a confusion and evasion tactic.  Personally I
don't use it, I think its effect is negligable and prefer
the ha ha step mixed up with drops and sidesteps, but some
people love it, so I'll put it in.  What happens is Lei
goes into the Rush Walk which you cancel with his back
stepping Cresent Kick which you cancel with a back turn
which you cancel with a back tap.  Result being that Lei's
legs flicker in a fairly disconcerting manner and he sort
of flys backwards.  This is more complex than the ha ha step
(Later) and its only major use is to get the opponent 
blocking by getting him to see the rush coming, but what's
the point of an avoidance move that makes the opponent
block?  I guess if you do this instead of rushes all the
time he'll start running at your rushes and you can
floor him with the rush combo, but you'd have to spend 
a whole round doing just this instead of Rushes and that
would be very hard to handle.

Stance Switches
----------------

The basic switches to stance without coming off a set-up
attack are generally weak, they should never be done
aimlessly since it loses you momentuum and initiative.
The stance changes worth doing have important defensive
properties though.

These stance changes should, quite frankly, be avoided.
There is, outlined later, a Pheonix game, but it should
be saved for switching up from Panther.  The Snake
stance is quick, but it still throws away initative
and if used should be used from a long way off before
embarking on a seriously planned string.  You should,
however, have custom strings planned from the start to
the end of the fight anyway, so you should never need
these.  As an example, any good Hwoarang player will
tell you that you should never need to switch feet.
Lei is the same.

Back Turned Stance b+1+4 (BK)                        Rating: 2

Back turned stance has two real uses.  Firstly, as a 
big fat backstep to slip out of range of attacks, for 
this use its pretty darn top notch and seems designed
to avoid Deathfists.  You can stick it onto a backdash
and earn yourself some quick avoidance distance,
basically hold the second back of your back dash and
press both kicks and you've doubled the distance of
your backdash.
The other use is the 'Ha Ha' step.  This might take a
while to explain, but its useful.  When you do the 
crescent kick with back Lei takes a step back.  You can
cancel this kick with Lei's back turn, and you can 
cancel this back turn with a tap back.  What you do is,
hit the input for the Crescent kick (b+3) and hold
the kick (3).  Then hit the second kick for the back
turn (4, giving 3+4).  Then hit back to cancel.
You'll be wanting to hit the kicks just a touch slower
than you would for the tornado kick.  If there were 
a notation for the move it would be b+3~4~b.  I think
this got its name because Lei makes his noise for the
kick without doing the move, so he shout's 'HA!' 
while backdashing.  Lei covers a lot of distance back
very quickly.  You opponent has to chase, you avoid
attacks, it needs some practice but its uses are 
obvious.  Mixing up this with other dashes, sidesteps,
rushes and cancels can confuse and is necessary at 
high level, especially when you get a wave dashing,
sidestepping Kazuya coming at you.
I believe that this move was invented in and practically
gained the first Tekken world championship, that's how 
powerful it can be, but its even better now since in Tekken 
4 back dashing has been weakened for everyone else.  Sadly, 
obviously, there isn't as much space as there used to be, so
it is limited on that level.  Using the Ha Ha you can run off 
from attacks, break back in with an attack at any point and 
generally mess up your opponent.  I can't really advice you
exactly how to use it more, simply to say you should learn and
use this move for your general movement and play, it is vital at
top level play and powerful at mid.

Suffice here to explain the differences and uses. 
Defensively dropping under a high or swinging mid

always use Play Dead, it give you the Kangeroo Kick
juggle and is slightly quicker than the Sidewinder.
Sidewinder is more a distance move to slow the pace
down or bring it back to your rythm.  Not too much
distance or you'll eat a stomp.

As with back turn and drop down this is a defensive
move.  When Lei whirls his hands before rearing back
in the move he will reverse punches by slipping
around and gaining priority.  Nothing is certain
from the reversal but the hop kick is a good call.
Apparently this will also reverse shoulder barges,
but I've not had this confirmed.  It will not
reverse from a move, or later in the sequence, just
at the start, but its window is still quite big and
Lei's unpredictable rearing back makes anyone 
attacking you high an idiot.  This is best in long
punch sequences from your opponent, good on a King
or Law sequence for instance.  Especially since
Law has a punch reversal of his own.

Ten Strings

Nine String:      b+121.3+4.3+4.3+4..1..1..2    Range: hhlMMMllm

Everyone knows that at top level of play ten strings
are worse than useless.  Those hits four, five and 
six all mid are a killer for Lei, even against a 
beginner player.  But those first three hits are 
useful as pokes, the third low hit can chip off 
some health and should probably be slipped into 
custom strings, also its the only punch canned combo that
has a low strike and leaves Lei back turned and it doesn't
require buffering to get it off, so often its the back 
turning weapon of choice.

Backturned Position
--------------------

Many fighters look to get around your back, Ling
and Hworang for instance, its not only not a 
problem for Lei, its a positive boon.  This
position is, quite simply, having his back turned.
He ends here from many stances, or from his back-
stepping back turn move.
He also has a vicious mix-up game from here, as from
everywhere.  Certain moves, the Rave Sweep/Spin, the
Falling Tree, and the turnaround hop kick should be 
considered practically the same as their front facing 
brothers.  Others like the High Backfist should only 
be used in juggles.  The rest have special uses.

Okay, no bones about it, this is potentially a very cheap
move.  From back turned you can just swing out the back
fists and if the first connects the following four will
juggle.  Only do this if you WANT to irritate your
opponent, which in my book is a fair piece of 
psychological warefare.  A much better option is to
break off after one and go into the Flip Flop Flip,
since all three flip kicks are certain and will cause more
damage.  You can, of course, break off after two, three or
four low backfists and go for the Flips but on anything other
than one a Tech Roll will save the opponent.  Course, if they
don't Tech Roll, then go for it.  You can't connect with the
Flips after the fifth low backfist, unless your opponent lies
there and lets you hit him, which is unlikely.
The greatest use in this move is that you can do it or the
Turning Uppercut from this position, both juggle, one hits low,
the other mid and both come out fast.  The implications for this
are obvious.  Simply doing this over the head of a grounded
opponent can set up a huge psychological advantage since the
first time people come across it it will catch them again, and 
everyone remembers that.  Do it over someone's head, then pause
and alternate it with the Rave Spin or the Uppercut.  You only
have to catch someone with one Turning Uppercut to make them
fear getting up in this position deeply.  If your opponent's
turtling force him to either interrupt or get juggled by swinging
this at him then switching up into the uppercut.  All around, 
the options this opens up and the fear it can create make it
a great move.  Imagine, catch the low punch into the Flips, that's
over Forty damage off a low punch, how can that be bad?

Turning Uppercut 2 *Juggles*                          Rating: 4

As mentioned above, this is quick, fluid and hits mid into a
juggle.  A good juggle starter too, this should be generally
mixed in with low punches and Rave Spins to protect them
and cause fear in your opponent.  Rave Sweeping from backturned
into Snake is a great tactic, but if your opponent blocks low
then you can't switch and you stumble, use the Uppercut to
protect that option for yourself.
Mixed up with other moves from this position this can be a
deadly attack.  The low infinite chained moving juggle/mid juggle 
mix up for me is an amazingly powerful option.

Wake-up.  Really the only use of this move, but a good use all
the same.  Tack this onto a low swinging punch and get over
Forty certain damage from a single low punch thanks to that
wake-up.  If you land one on a lying opponent the other two
are certain, so don't ignore this, if he's down and you're
backturned, think about this.  Its not as quick as, say, the
Rave Sweep that strikes low, but it causes a lot more damage.
If you know you have the option to use it, say someone is
staying down a lot and eating wake-ups (Later) use it.

Lying Down
-----------

Lei, famously, has a lot of extra options from the floor. 
He's the only fighter who can do this, and it should be 
taken advantage of.  I'll say more about the tactical
implications of lying down, for now, here are the moves
and some ideas to use with them.
I won't bother mentioning the basic sweeps and stand ups
or mid-kicks unless they have a special use.  Do note
that Lei can always roll over into the other of the two
down positions you're in, that's to say, FU/FA to FD/FA
or FU/FT to FD/FT and back.  From some positions lying
Lei can do moves covered above, such as the Rave Sweep,
if not mentioned here, treat it in the way that you would
the similar while standing move.  Always keep in mind the
low and mid kick options Lei has from every stance, he 
can come from lying down faster than everyone else and
these can be used as wake-up and confusion options.

Long range, hits low and switches your stance, good move.
Also you recover first so you get a free Rave Sweep to
make it a good damaging move.  The problem is that
everyone knows this is the move to do from this position,
but we can turn that to our advantage.  First of all, most
none-Lei players won't quite register the difference between
face up or face down, what they will do is register how
you got into the stance and what moves followed it, so if
you go for this from the Sidewinder once he'll expect 
it the next time, but if he sees you roll over from FU/FA
he probably won't expect it, until the second time.
A good trick is, the second time you do this from the same
set-up, roll towards the opponent and Mid Kick him in the
face (4) odds are he'll still be ducking.  Then next time,
roll at him and sweep (3).  Then just start to mix them up.
Its perfect against Turtle play, and even some strikers
will be too afraid of the weird lying Lei to punk you out
of the roll.

Kangeroo Kick (FU/FA) 3+4 *Juggles*                  Rating: 3

Given that you've dropped to the floor under your opponent's
blundering flails, this is the boy to pop up with every time.
If you drop and he swings at air, use this, simple as that.
When you drop buffer (later) one of the kicks and then tap
the other again, its a gift of a juggle and gets style
points in the bank to make up for earlier cheapness.
If you have not dropped under an attack this is probably best
avoided.  Firstly, it strikes mid, secondly, it can be reversed
and thirdly, its not too quick.  If you find yourself in this
position then use the Rave Sweep which can be done from here.
When your opponent starts duck blocking the second he sees you
in this position, THEN you should start using it without
making him wiff an attack.  And Cackle, oh yes, Cackle.

Best move from Face down feet towards position.  Strikes low
and leaves you in position for more useful attacks, either
a Kangeroo Kick or another Sweeping strike, probably the
second sweep is the safest option.  The Kangeroo can catch an
opponent layed low by your Falling Sweep though to good 
effect.

Tornado Kick[s] b+4 [U] (BK)                         Rating: 3

What you want to do is, go into Phoenix from a distance,
everyone knows that Phoenix has a long ranged 
unblockable so they're likely to run at you and try to
pop you in the face rather than back off, since its range
is so long.  Whip this out and you'll tag them as they
run in.  The next time you go into the stance they'll
most likely block back, which is when you hit the strike,
by the time you foot starts glowing it'll be too late
for them.  Its not a one to abuse, but once or twice a
match it can hand you quite a bit of an advantage.  Since
the Tornados are the same as the normal Tornados with
the back turned, drop down and triple flips mix-up
option its worth going into this a few times and 
training the opponent to block just in case you need 
the desperation strike of the unblockable.
Also, you can come out with the back turned tornado
uppercut right off one of these.  If you land next to an
opponent without hitting him and he goes for an attack
assuming that your slow tornados are coming again
then this can pop him up.  There's nothing wrong with
doing it on purpose in fact and tempting them into it
on purpose.

Drunken Master
---------------

Drunken Stance is another one that often gets discounted,
it looks silly and requires some forward planning since 
it only has three offensive moves.  It is, however, a 
punch reversal and a position from which you can recover 
health, both of which are very useful options.  Don't, 
however, fall into the trap of panicking and hitting a
single kick, because it'll do nothing and you'll end up
getting popped.  Lei rears back constantly in this move
meaning that he's very hard to hit high and tough to 
judge range on, meaning some people will be reluctant to
attack you, their mistake.  Most of all, stay calm in
Drunken, lots of people forget that it has switch up 
options of its own.  First of, all a few words on 
the reversal itself.
It takes a fraction of a second to initiate so it can be 
hard to time, but it also has a longer window than any
other reversal so it can be good for long preparation
punches coming at you, such as Paul's unblockable.  Suffice
to say that it takes some getting used to, but it can't
be chickened, so is great for high level play.  Sadly
nothing is certain from it, so you'll have to mix up
hop kicks and Rave Sweeps on it.  Its a good option
though and when you're being hammered by Paul or Law's
punch sets you'll be glad for it.

Kiss My Fist 1 [F] [Drunken Stance]                    Rating: 3

Hits mid, causes knock back and has good range.  This and
the low kicks should really be your options out of this
stance, or of course, to leave you in it, depending on
how effective the game is working out for you.  Not too
much to say about it, if you land it the knock back is
enough to give you a free Tiger Sip, so if you intend
to remain in Drunken Stance, be sure to hold 1 as well 
as forward after the stance and tap 2 to gain yourself
a bit of free health.

you in Drunken Stance and prefers to just stand there and
let it wear off pop out a few of these and force him to 
attack, preferably right into a Kiss My Fist.  Also ducks
high attacks, but since all three of the good Drunken 
stance moves do and the stance is itself a high punch
reversal anyone who attacks you with a high attack while
your in it is asking for a beating.  As said previously,
the Drunken Stance's rather poorly understood reversal
properties, plus its auto rearing, backstepping and 
sidestepping make many people unwilling to attack you
in this stance.  As such, this move to make them
paranoid about leaving you in it.  They'll start rushing 
into you and leaving themselves open, just the way you 
like.

Strikes low, knocks the opponent down, leaves you on the
floor.  Its most important use is as mix up with the
Fist to make people have to call on ducking or standing.
Of course, its not quick and many people can block it on
reaction, but it helps the guessing game anyway.  If this
connects go into a falling sweep, then Rave Sweep and
get some nice damage out of it.  All in a neat move, 
better for its mix-up with the Fist.

Animal Stances
---------------

To start with, a few words on Animal stances generally.
First of all, you cannot backdash, backturn, drop to the
floor or block and stay in them with animal stances.
What this basically means in real terms is that if your
opponent gets off an attack you're going to hand away a
lot of priority and, with the effort of getting into the 
stance, a lot of work.  You can walk though and you can 
block, plus a few of the moves have other parry or 
avoidance properties that make up for the losses.  The
only way to really combat this is to have your moves from 
Animal planned, you should not go into them expecting to
play an actual match in them, you should do it as part of
one long custom string.  Either stay constantly in the
attack in them, or know your interrupts and parrys inside
out.  Note however that your opponent almost certainly won't
know the exact details of all the strengths and weakenessess
of the animal stances unless he's a Lei player himself so 
you can use that.  Its best to get the hang of animal stances
one at a time, adding each new one into your strings a bit
at a time until you understand them all inside out.

Snake Stance
-------------

Snake stance is the central animal stance, its the one that
you will end up in most often and the one with the quickest
varied attacks.  Its a safe stance, easy to get the hang of
and often used.  Be warned that you cannot block low in Snake,
so you will have to protect against low attacks using the
low jab kick.  You can block high and mid normally though,
which makes it the easiest animal stance to get the hang of.

Rushing Snake/Stabbing Punches 1,[1,1,1,1,1]           Rating: 3

A set of fast high punches.  They land so fast that if one
lands your opponent has to either eat or block them, if you
hold foward on the stick after any but the first punch
you'll auto sidestep and go into Snake again.  Since the
punches have no guard stun at all and leave your opponent
standing anyway you'll almost always get popped out of that
stance change though.
These punches insanely fast though and can be used to make
opponents who grow calm about the Snake stance weary again.
They interrupt almost any move in the game, given that
people love to attack you in animal stances this is a good
to have.  Best used to protect yourself, and in the 
occasional juggle.  If you land with one then go to 
three of them and break off into Snake again by holding 
forward, since three are certain but only three and noone 
is going to be stupid enough to be going for an interrupt 
on these for you to get the last few off.  If they block 
then go through all five to keep them blocking and don't 
go back into Snake. 

Snake Kick/Low Jab Kick 4 (SK)                         Rating: 3

Basically using the stabbing punches with the jab kick
you should both protect and set up the stronger attacks
from Snake.  This is quick, leaves you in Snake without
a sidestep and strikes low, and so is your best piece of
Snake protection.  What I mean by that is that if your 
opponent gets too calm and places an attack, or just throws 
out an attack that you block you'll lose your Snake and your 
option for a better attack.  What the jab kick and the 
stabbing punches are for is to stop that happening and protect 
the stronger option for the stance, later.
This is a slightly better move than the Snake Jabs because
you should really fear the low attacks in Snake, not being 
able to even block them, so this should be used to molest
low attackers that the jabs will go right over.

         ,2[F] [Panther Stance] Three Snake Bites
         ,4,3,3 Rolling kicks to Lift-up cannon

This, incase you were wondering, is what you're protecting
with your low jab kicks and stabbing snakes.  First of all
I don't see any good reason to do the rolling kicks to
cannon.  I also see no good reason at all for ending this
move with the Dragon Stance option.  What I see damn good 
reason for either one or three bites.  Reason for which I
will now explain.
First of all, the three bites.  Mid Mid Low, sounds pretty
simple, but for some reason people never seem to block the
last hit on this set.  Actually, they have good reason, the
mid punches create guard stun and even when blocking them the
window to get down and block the third punch is tiny.  Better
still, you end up in Panther stance after some lazy free 
damage.  You can use these three in simple juggles, best 
being from the Rave Sweep, end it in Panther and be standing 
over your opponent in Panther stance (More on that later).
Second of all, breaking off after one bite.  The first bite,
if it lands counter hit, will cause severe crumple stun.
Now, this crumple is escapable, but its fairly rare.  This
crumple stun is enough for you to land a hop kick and then
follow it up with a juggle that weighs in at eighty five 
points of damage, that's practically an entire energy
bar.  This move alone is good reason to super charge before 
going into Snake Stance, to gain yourself the best 
counter-hit possibility, this move alone can win a whole 
round.

Dragon Stance
--------------

Dragon Stance, while having its uses, is pretty much the 
worst of the animal stances.  This is partly because the
others are so good.  It doesn't auto parry anything and
barely avoids anything, plus its not wicked fast so its not great
to staying in.  If you find yourself in it it has some
uses, but don't go looking for it.  Lei's kicks from here,
the Crescent (3,3) and the Beating Rush (4,1,2,3,4_d+4)
can be considered identical to their normal stance 
versions, if a little more confusing for the opponent.
Also, as with Snake you can't block low in this stance.
Unlike Snake you lack the real tools to protect yourself
from low attacks, on the upside both your main attacks
from here hit mid though so you should be able to make
people fear ducking for that reason.
Dragon sometimes seems to be too low for high attacks to
hit it, but don't rely on that by any means, its only some
high attacks, not like, say, panther stance.

Double Arm Strike/Dragon Spark 1+2 [F] [TS]            Rating: 2

No reason to do this.  The Roar is a better move, though
this causes five more damage the Roar occasionally 
juggles and its only one button to perform, and you can
still go into Tiger from it too.  If anyone knows why
to do this, tell me.
Okay, having said that, on counter this does bowl people
back enough to charge at them and make them roll to avoid
the stomp.  If you're into watching your opponent roll to
his side then rising kick you, then this is your baby.
That was a little mean, you can often cause more damage
by charging someone on the floor in mid level play, so
it has something there, be warned though that charging
grounded opponents at top level play can be a surprisingly
double edged sword.

Uppercut/Dragon Roar 2 [F] [TS]                        Rating: 3

This juggles on counterhit, occasionally.  It doesn't
even always juggle if you get the counterhit, which
can be frustrating, if it does juggle your best option
is the rolling kicks, but you'll probably have gone
into Tiger stance so the low kick would be the option
of choice.  Not a great move either, but as said
already, Dragon is the weak stance.

Panther Stance
---------------

Auto Parry Low - F

Panther Stance, good old Panther Stance.  With an
auto low parry and natural high attack avoidance
Panther Stance has the best defences of all the
animal stances.  Lei ducks low so high attacks will
wiff over his head, letting you in for a free 
juggle with the Uppercut, for that matter most
mid kicks will go over his head too.  Hold forward 
and Lei will auto parry low attacks leaving you 
with a free hop kick into juggle again.  Be careful on that
though, because if you leave him in neutral he will be lower
than if you hold forward, shuffling him forward, so while in 
neutral you can duck more mid attacks, while holding forward you have 
the parry so watch for it.  
Basically though only mid attacks will hit you in this stance, and
as a rule only mid punches, but watch for them
because you can't block them at all.  Lei also takes 
his broadest steps of all the stances making him his 
fastest in animal.  A wicked trick is to end in 
Panther over downed opponents and hold forward.  
If they rise low kicking, auto-parry into hop kick.  
If they rise high kicking and sometimes mid kicking 
it will go over Lei's head and leave you to uppercut
and juggle.  If they roll hit the Claw and pop them
right out of it, if they stand and block hit the 
uppercut into Guard melting punches and force them to
keep guessing you.  Having Lei stand over you in
Panther Stance is a really bad position to be in.
Make damn sure they know that.
Panther also has the Crescent Rush from it, but 
its other options are so strong I can't imagine
anyone using it.
On the Panther Stance parry to hop kick, watch your range
since it is possible to just barely wiff the hop kick.

Panther Claw 1~2                                      Rating: 3

Comes out wicked fast and hits low then high.  Best
for wake up since it will slap anyone who doesn't fear
the Panther Stance in wake up for six.  If they
block it you get horrible recovery so don't even think 
of trying it on someone that's already crouching, pop
them with the uppercut.  In fact, try to avoid using
the second part on any standing opponent, instead
keep it for juggles and wake-up, the low attack alone
(Panther Scratch) knocks the opponent over and leaves 
him right at your feet for some powerful wake-up.
True, if the first part hits the second is certain, 
but the reward is too low for the risk of the block 
and hop kick.  Also, if blocked the low hit pushes
your opponent too far back to make him switch to 
blocking mid, it'll just wiff.

 ,1,2       Guard Melting Punches *Juggles*
     ,1     Guard Melting Punch (BK)

Fast, mid hitting juggling uppercut is a good move.
A mid hitting move from a situation where most 
people will fear your low attacks is better.  This
is all those things, and more.  Because of course, 
this has the guard melting punches on it.  
Remember all those tricks and slips from before,
they can all be used here just the same only better,
if you land the normal guard melting first punch
you get a razor rush.  In fact an opponent would
be best advised to eat the first melting punch
and then block the rush.  Not so here, if you land
the uppercut, you get a juggle, if you land the
third hit, you get a juggle, if you land the
hopkick or sweep from the fourth punch, you get
a juggle.  Can you see now why this got a four?
Given the powers of the Panther Stance generally
this is a great move, mixed up with the Scratch 
to make people wary of throwing out reversals on
it this move can be a nightmare for people to deal
with.
All that said, note that there is a lag between the uppercut
and guard melters here, so don't over use them, a fast jab or
similar can interrupt.  Kudos to ConfuciusQ for that one.

Panther Tail 3 [b] [Pheonix Illusion]                Rating: 2

A pretty basic sweep, does no knock down, only
reason to do this is if you are obsessed with
Pheonix stance for some odd reason.  Best
sticking with the Scratch really.

Tiger Stance
-------------

Auto Parry High/Mid - F

Tiger Stance has auto Mid-High Parry, which 
means it can only be hit with low attacks 
so long as you hold forward.  Which goes
back to what I was saying about not being
able to block etc. in animal stance not 
being as bad as it sounds.  You only need fear
low attacks in this stance, anything else is
gifting you a hop kick.  Now, it is true that
on this parry nothing is certain, as some people
have mailed to point out to me, but it is very
likely.  Best bet against top players is the rave
sweep though as a follow up if I'm honest.  I'll 
still stick with the hop kick though.
You can, again, do the Rush Combo from here,
it has the same properties as normal without
having to go into the Rush walk, again, the 
special options from here should be used thanks
to their confusion and special uses.  Besides, 
you worked your ass off getting here, you should 
use it.

Tiger Strike/Overhead Swipe *Bounce Juggle*          Rating: 3

This will bounce juggle on counterhit, and sometimes
seems to on none counterhit, but only counterhit is
certain.  Anyway, you get a nice juggle off it which
is always worth the money.

Tiger Claw                                           Rating: 4

This will guard stun a standing opponent enough for
you to have an advantage such to make a Rave Sweep
a fair option, but most important makes retaliation
impossible.  Better on crouching opponents who
it will knock to the knee giving a certain hop kick
chance to juggle.  Since the Tiger Tail gives
juggle chances from here and this move comes out
fast you can see the chance for a nasty mix-up
guessing game.  Block low and the Tiger Claw
gives a big juggle.  Block mid and the Tiger Tail
gives a fairly big one.  This comes out pretty quick
too.  It gets its rating only from mix up with the
Tiger Tail to get your opponent blocking low and 
as such gifting you anywhere up to an eighty seven
point juggle.

Tiger Tail/Fast Sweep 4 *Floats*                     Rating: 4

Hits low and floats enough for you to land a set of
rolling kicks, or if you're a little faster an 
uppercut into rolling kicks.  Or if you're wicked
fast an uppercut into full Rush combo mixed up
with the Claw a really nasty little attack.
Comes out fast too.  The only downside to this
little pair of moves is that blocking the Tiger
Tail causes Lei to stumble a teeny bit, but that's 
not a big downside with the rewards possible.

Crane Stance
-------------

CRANE DEFENCE *Auto Avoid Low attacks* - N

Panther Stance is probably the best animal stance
defensively, Tiger has the best simple but deadly
options, Snake is the most central, but Crane has 
the style.  No fighter or move in Tekken looks
more stylish than Lei standing back in Crane 
Stance.  New to Tekken 4 is the Crane defence,
which means that when the stick is neutral Lei
hops over low attacks.  Lei cannot, however, block
high or mid attacks, so its often best to attack first
from this stance.  I would like to say as an aside though
that Lei should have an unblockable from Crane Stance, 
because 'If done right, there is no defence'.
Crane has the most special attacks from it and
it doesn't get seen too much being at the end of the 
punch rush and the stance switching set.  Its my personal
favourite after Panther, even though its actually less 
effective than Tiger, and it has good options.  Plus, 
a mad psyching out effect, noone wants to let Lei stand
there in Crane, you can say as certain as anything that
your opponent will rush in and attack you in Crane.  A
predictable opponent is a weak opponent.

Crane Bill 1                                          Rating: 2

A little slow, it hits mid and knocks the opponent back
but its speed is a terrible.  If blocked it works a bit 
like the last punch of the guard melting punches, but
leaves you further away from your opponent.  If you get
it on counter hit it does massive damage and knocks them
back enough for a running shoulder barge, but its a bit 
slow to play for that.

Wing of Crane 2 (BK)                                  Rating: 2

Loses a point of rating for hitting high, and another 
for not causing enough guard stun and leaving you close.
This always leaves you backturned, and leaves him
backturned, but only if it connects.  Since it hits high
the odds of it connecting are slight, since its a little
slow with Lei turning back then doing the move.  If it
does connect though you have a pretty much certain 
turning hop kick to juggle, so it gets a few points for 
that.  Good for beginners who still charge you in Crane, 
better really than the dance for that use.

Hop Forward Low Kick/Crane Kick                      Rating: 3

At low level and starting play people will charge the 
Crane.  A few Wing of Cranes will soon stop that, when
it does they'll just block and wait for you to attack.
When they do this is what you attack with.
Very good range since Lei hops forward and it leaves the
opponent face down since he kicks their kneecaps off.
Also it hits low.  Use it on opponents who have grown wary
of the Crane.

Crane Dance 3>4>2>3 *Juggles*                       Rating: 3

The opponent has learnt not to charge you, he's also 
learnt about the Crane Kick, so he's ducking just out
of range waiting for you to hop forward so he can block
and attack, what do you do?  This is what you do.
If you connect the first hit on a crouching opponent the
next two are certain no matter what he does.  The last
hits mid and juggles, so you have a good chance of it,
especially if you break off on the third hit and do a low
kick once or twice, so he starts blocking low at the end of
it.  If he stands blocking then the second and third hits
will connect, so unless he's actively blocking well you'll at 
least get a few hits on this.  And when he starts stand blocking 
you in Crane again hit him with the hopping low kick.  Nothing 
will make that last juggling kick certain, so if you get it its 
just a free gift from your opponent, be ready to take advantage, 
but don't expect it to come for you.
After a while people will just back off from you in Crane Stance
out of fear, but so long as you're ahead in health, just wait it out,
they'll snap first.

===========
7) JUGGLES
===========

First of all, this section is, and never will be, totally
exhaustive.  If anyone has a juggle not here they want to share,
especially one with real use, either for stance switching or
greater damage and even more so one that usefully incorporates
new Tekken 4 moves or walls please let me know and I'll include 
it on an update, drop it to me at Glenn@glnf.demon.co.uk .  
Once again, I've checked and double checked all this in Tekken
Tag and a deal of it on Tekken 4 but anyone who wants to 
confirm it would be doing me a favour.
Juggles are where you pop an opponent up with an uppercut or
hop kick and then hit him some more before he even hits the
floor, they're the secret to top level play where very few
hits will land and you need to make them all count.  In a juggle
the second hit causes less than normal damage, the third and 
following hits less again.  As a rule the second hit of a juggle
causes seventy percent normal damage and the following hits 
only forty.  This does not include moves such as crumple stun
juggles and ground juggles.  These are included here because
they are a long series of attacks during which your opponent 
cannot respond.  Crumple stun happens in certain occasions
where instead of dropping to the floor an opponent crumples
slowly to the ground, letting you get in further attacks if
you're clever.  Ground juggles are where you hit someone as 
they hit the floor either too fast for tech roll or in a 
situation where tech rolling is impossible.  This is different 
from wake-up, since in a ground juggle the opponent can do
nothing to stop the damage.  In wake-up you're playing a
careful and deadly guessing game with him.
For most characters its a good idea to pick one high damaging
juggle from each starter and learn it and it alone.  Sadly, for
Lei this is simply not true.  First of all he has more launchers
than almost any other character due to his mass of stances.
Secondly, any other character after a juggle ends up in the same
stance, standing normally.  For Lei this is not true, he can often
end up back turned, lying down or animal stance.  What this means
is that you often have to learn about three juggles for each
launcher to keep his mix-up going or lose damage chances.  It 
also means you'll never get called cheap in your juggle game for
just learning one high damage juggle and using it all the time.
Another thing it means is that this section is necessarily 
going to be rather complex.  What I'm going to do is split it
into launchers and finishers and designate which can follow from 
which.  I'll also grade each part with a difficulty from simple, 
middle to hard with one to three stars.  They may be hard for the 
timing or just for sheer speed.  Launchers are anything that can 
begin a juggle, finishers anything that can finish a juggle.
There is two exceptions, the ultimate Launcher as it were, the 
Snake Stance Counterhit, and the semi ultimate, the Tiger Knee 
Stun.  If the Snake lands it can be tacked onto anything to gain 
some extra damage, so I'll list it seperatly with the Tiger Knee Stun.
The notation will go, button hits, damage, difficulty rating 
then follow-ups.  There are many minor juggles such as a launcher
and a single hit not included here, and some of them do significant
damage, for instance, if ever caught unsure what to do the Crescent 
kick (3) will almost always connect and to about twenty damage, but
those moves are not included here.  Also there are semi juggles, ones
that will strike provided the opponent doesn't quick roll or that
rely on him not turning or ducking or some such, they are also
not included, they are not juggles, but are tactics.  There are
plenty of semi juggles that can be tech rolled out of not here.

Juggle Strategies
------------------

Yeah, its not just all that crap you have to get the hang
of, there are also strategies to juggling, this is really
something that only Lei has to get the hang of since as
said previously only he has so many stances to end in.
When juggling you've got four choices which you have 
to understand and take hold of, something that once again,
noone else has to do.
1:  Go for your out and out most damaging juggle from the
launcher irrespective of finishing stance.
2:  Go for a less damaging juggle that ends with a stance 
the options of which you happen to like, Crane, Tiger, 
whatever, with the intent of gaining another juggle or
damage chance.  Often an extra hit or two on a standing 
opponent which will cause one hundred percent damage 
can be better than a longer juggle, if more risky.
3:  Go for a tech-rollable attack, popping in 3~4 or
4~4,3,3 onto a juggle can get you extra damage that will
only land if the opponent stays down or stands right up.
4:  Go for a juggle with the punch rush in and break off
into a stance to stand over them in it, with the various
mix-ups discussed before, Panther stance and Tiger Stance
are favourites for this tactic.  Much like tactic two, 
but here you can pick and choose a stance.  This can be a
devestatingly effective tactic, juggling to punch rush,
switching and catching a parry to hop kick, Panther Paw
or Tiger Claw to juggle and doing the whole thing again.
Mixing up, as always, these options, can make your juggle
and guessing game dangerous, effective, and an object of
genuine fear.  Other people only really have option one or
three, Lei is hard work, but his rewards are great.

.....................................................................

=============
9) WALL WORK
=============

The new major add-on to Tekken, as everyone knows, is the 
introduction of walls.  Its going to be a while before we
all get the full implications of this part of the game, but
with Tekken being so well balanced you can believe this makes 
a difference.  Here's where the bad news begins.  Lei is close 
to the worst person from the walls.



.....................................................................


======================
8) GENERAL STRATEGIES
======================

Back in Lei in General I mentioned some of Lei's properties, but I'm 
going to go over them again here and mention some more general facts 
about Lei play.
As a word on general tactics, remember that Lei cannot block to some 
degree in all but one of his stances, his normal stance.  As such it 
doesn't take a genius to work out that his strengths lie in his 
attacking game, Lei should certainly be used offensively.  That said 
his defence game is deadly since, unlike most people, it revolves
not around blocking, but around avoidance, confusion and his
various parrys, all of which are better than all out blocking.
Also, Lei has the widest move list and the most stylish play of any
Tekken character.  For god's sakes bear this in mind, don't waste
all that style, use those stances, he has, all in, fourteen
different positions where different moves are avaliable:

Normal 
Play Dead (Face up, feet away)
Knockdown (Face up, feet towards)
Sidewinder (Face down, feet towards)
Resting (Face down, feet away)
Back-turned
Drunken master
Snake stance
Dragon stance
Tiger stance
Panther stance
Crane stance
Phoenix Illusion
Rush Walk

This makes Lei unmistakably unique, which is sort of a shame.  A
shame because if you learn one Mishima you can easily learn them
all, or if you learn Law you can go across to Lee, Nina and Anna, 
King and Armour King (Tekken Tag only).  Point being that if you
learnt one person in a previous Tekken you have a grounding for
other people in the new Tekkens, or if you have learnt certain 
people in this Tekken you can transfer those skill across.  
This just isn't true for Lei, he's totally unique, his juggling
is unique, his stances, his moves, everything.  Not only is noone
like Lei, noone's close.
Also, the most important tactic for Lei is in your head, or rather
your opponent's.  Lei is cunning, tricky and vicious, use every piece
of trickery and deception to get damage off your opponent.
Finally, make a call, as early on as you can, on what sort of player
your opponent is.  PitBull and Turtle is the normal term, but it is
more complex than that, players tend to be re-active or proactive, 
they either play their game or react to yours.  Either way, take 
advantage.  If someone is Turtling, attack away, use your tricks,
anyone who gives a Lei thinking time is asking for a beating.
If they're playing a custom string or pattern without paying due
attention to what you're doing then destroy them.  Lei is a god
of custom stringing, he can literally fight a whole round without
looking at the screen almost by stringing attacks and stances
in a bewildering array.  Either way use your opponents style 
against him as well as you can.
Something to keep in mind is that Lei is a control freak.  Despite
his weird apperance, his drunken style and Crane stance he thrives
on controlling his opponent.  He needs to control both the pace of
the game and the range of the attacks.  Because he has a great set 
of moves that leave him at short or long range that can come from
long or short range he can decide at what range to keep himself and
his opponent.  That's a great power and should be used.
The hardest thing for Lei is controlling the pace.  Lei prefers the 
pace of a match to be smooth and rythmic, not slow or fast as such, 
but to a distinct rythm, that's what his custom strings and stances
are for, keep this in mind.  If its a little fast for you, you're 
under too much pressure, slow it down, dodge away, drop to the floor,
control the pace.  If its a little slow, someone's turtling, swing
out a long set of stance switching attacks to move things along, 
Lei does not play well as a re-active character, he generally needs
to control the pace.  Lei needs to control the pace and range of the 
fight in order to apply his guessing game mix-ups, and his moves are
almost all tools either to gain that control, or to be part of one
of those mix-ups.  You need to understand which is which and where to 
use each.


Advantages and Disadvantages
-----------------------------

Pros:

Movement, Lei has probably the best sideways, backwards and forwards
movement in the game.  Noone can shift like he can.
Lei can mix it up.  Lei was the first member of the Tekken crew to 
own special stances, since his introduction in Tekken two every new 
character has been given special stances and many of the old 
characters have been updated by their additions.  Special stances are 
a power, a serious power and Lei is their master.  You can and should 
use them smoothly and well.  Over this, almost all of Lei's moves can
be used in one or another mid/low guessing game, he can switch up, he
can force guessing.
Lei is powerful, his basic kicks, punches and  general moves such as 
the headbutt are some of the most damaging in the game.  Lei can, 
quite simply, batter off chunks of power.  He has the sort of power 
that Paul and Kazuya throw out but with the chaining abilities of 
Hwoarang or the stringing of Law.
Lei is a great all rounder.  He isn't the best in the game at
anything, but he can match almost anyone at their own game and, 
more importantly, he can always step out to another part of his game
where more single ability based characters will end up out of their
depths.
Wake up, or rather, Okizeme, not quite up there with King, but Lei's 
wake-up is some of the best in Tekken, expecially with so many moves 
that can't be avoided by staying on the floor.
Control, Lei's moves are all for one of three things, changing 
stance, setting mix-ups or controlling the pace and range of the
fight.  Combine these and you have a character capable of total 
control of a match.

Cons:

Lei is hard to master.  He's not Paul or Law, for instance, who are 
fairly straight forward.  I don't have down every single technique 
listed in this FAQ, I've used them all at one point or another, but 
using all of them smoothly and instantly is a point that most people 
will probably never come to.  Don't expect instant results, in fact, 
expect to get battered a lot.  Also, when you come up with a new 
technique that sounds like it should work it can often take a lot 
of work to usefully incorporate it into your actual gameplay.  I've
been playing Lei since Tekken 2 and can still say in all honest I
haven't mastered him.  This can be discouraging, but I consider
Lei the most rewarding character I've ever played.
Lei can be made cheap and abusive.  Along with his powers and 
strengths is the fact that you can hear your opponent groan as
you select him in fear of almost Eddy like cheapness.  Don't
fall to it, stay both varied and impressive, and remain powerful
but skilled at the same time.
You can find yourself becoming repetitive.  Since to use all of
Lei's moves involves going through all of his stances and they
lead off from only certain moves you can find yourself cycling
through the same stances and moves back and forth.  Its very
important to keep your custom strings mixed up well.  This is
double harsh since not only can your play become boring and 
stilted for you, but for Lei predictability is death.
Fragility, for some characters predictablity is not a problem,
and repeating moves doesn't cause too much trouble.  Paul, for
instance, can win a match by using no more than five different
moves.  Lei cannot do this, his game is much more fragile, if
he gets broken up then he can have severe problems.
Fighting out the crouch.  Lei cannot fight from a crouch at all
he has no good while crouching or while standing moves, he can't 
use his amazing movement, he can't stance change, if he's forced into 
ducking he is at a severe disadvantage.  Since you have to duck to 
block or avoid half the moves in the game, this is a serious lack in
his game.


Lying, Back turned and Standing
--------------------------------

A little history here, so pay attention.  Back in Tekken 2
Lei had no animal stances, apart from of course Pheonix
Illusion.  All he had was back turning, dropping down and
Rush walking.  What this means, as a rule, is that there 
is something of a devision between Lei players, between
the ones that prefer to drop and turn, staying out of 
animal stances for the most part, and the ones that switch
from animal to animal mixing them up.  There is no right or
wrong answer to this one.  What there is is a difference
in style.  First of all, you can win a match without ever
going into an animal stance or without ever dropping to the
floor.  There's just no reason to.
The difference is that a standing or animal stance Lei tends 
to be more aggressive and a lying or backturned one more 
defensive, planning more to lure people into traps.
Against pit bulls dropping as a defensive move is vital for
Lei, and popping right back up again.  Personally, I don't 
drop very much, haven't for quite a while, unless I conciously
decide to play a dropping game, and when I do I play a totally
different game from before, almost like a different character.
You'll probably know pretty soon which you are, a stance player
or a dropping player, go to your strengths, but always do your 
best to occasionally switch the game up and do whatever it is you
normally avoid.
What is useful in the dropping game is its spacing possibilities.
Most people when they see you drop, even at high level play, will
take a second to work out what the hell happened.  Some people will
even drop and stand, drop and stand, drop and stand over and over
to confuse the opponent.  Personally I wouldn't do this, that pause
of shock only last a second really and the opponent will either 
stand back and wait for you to stop messing about, or smack you when
you're vunerable.  Either way, the dropping game is defensive and
avoidance.
Another difference between backturning dropping and animal stances
is that animal stances tend to slow the game down.  When swinging
around to back turns and out again Lei is in almost perpetual motion.
In a way, he's what I think Yoshimitsu was always meant to be at
this point, Lei, after all, can spin more than Yoshi and he'll never
fall down.  Mixing a none defensive dropping and backturning game
you can get a constant tornado of attacks without pause.  This is
Lei's other great skill, controlling the rythm of the fight.  Either
constant and fast with the turning dropping, or staggered and spaced
with the animal and rushing stances.

Stance Switching
-----------------

As metioned stance switching, animal stances that is, makes for a
different game from the turning dropping game.  It tends to be more
agressive and yet a little slower and more rythmical.  Which sounds
odd but you'll understand it if you play with the Lei for a while.
The big question with animal stance is when to make the switch, when
to go from normal or one stance to another.  Some people think that
stance changing should be a defensive move, using the sidestep
stance change option.  Personally I disagree totally.  The straight
sidestep stance change tends to take too long in my estimation, if
I'm someone's side I want to get off an attack right away, plus you
can only switch into Snake in this way, and once you're in animal
stance noone will let you sidestep again.  Even if they do, the 
up/down sidestep can be a little unpredictable since first of all 
in the heat of battle you can forget that panther is down from Crane
and Dragon up from Tiger, unless you're facing the wrong way of
course, plus the sidestep down from Crane to Panther is longer than
all the others, which is something I can't be doing to factor in,
but good for you if you can.
What I suggest is to stance switch off of moves, you can stance 
switch from half of Lei's moves and you can get to any stance almost 
instantly this way and in a much more direct agressive fashion.
I think you should almost always take advantage of the chance to
switch up to animal stances, but that said, as a beginner its 
best to pick one animal stance and learn all its ins and outs
and to really ignore the others unless you end in them naturally
when you should experiment with them and treat it as a learning 
experience.  Playing Lei most things are a learning experience.


Defense
--------

There will come points when you have to step back and play 
defensively.  Hopefully not too much, but enough that you
should know what you're doing.  The main thing to remember 
in defence is to remain calm, predict your opponent and
always do the smart thing.  Which is actually easier than
it sounds a lot of the time.  The problem with Tekken, or
rather, its beauty, is that its not enough to only know
your own character.  The characters are so varied as to 
mean that you have to learn all their oddnesses, their hit 
ranges attacks and skills.  You need to know, once a hit 
string has been embarked on which hit is most likely to 
follow from it.  Sadly I cannot help you in this, it'll
only come with experience and practice, but if Lei isn't
your first Tekken character you'll have an advantage when
fighting your old character.  Everyone else's strings have 
to end one way or another, learn them and use them.  If 
you don't get hit, you can't lose.
First of all, blocking.  You can block low hits only by
ducking and they cause the least damage.  You can block
mid hits only by standing and they cause mid damage.
You can block High attacks by ducking and avoiding them
or by standing, they cause the most damage.

Interrupting
-------------

Countering, interrupting, fighting fire with fire.  All of them mean
the same thing, stopping your opponent's attack before it comes out
battering him back using a faster attack with better priority that
your opponent.  Lei has all the moves to do this, the low jab, (d+1)
is the fastest move in the game, so its the best on reactions 
interrupt.  On top of this Lei has his snake punches (f+1+2) or 
his jab kicks (d+4).
Use these when you have to, but they are risky, use them to keep
your opponent out.  Advice is both above and below in the character
specific tactics for dealing with specific attacks that have to
be kept out.
 
Sidestepping
-------------

Sidestepping is vital and has been for a while in Tekken, but with
the addition of walls its simply essential.
Blocking is hard since you have to decide if a strike is landing 
low mid or high.  Interrupting is harder since you have to decide
that and the speed it is landing at in relation to the speed of 
your own attack, and how long into the relative enactions of the
moves you are.  Sidestepping is a little harder because you have
to know all of that, plus you have to understand how the move
swings and how it tracks.  Moves swing, some swing around in an
ark right to left, others left to right, obviously you need to 
know this to sidestep certain moves.  Secondly, they track, 
Each move has a point where it follows the other player's 
movements, then a point when they stop and just go ahead with 
the move, their tracking.  If you sidestep on a move that's 
tracking not only will you get busted, you'll have wasted your
efforts.
Every attack can be sidestepped, but its not always a good idea.
Once again, advice on this will be given later, along with the
advice on certain specific sidestep attacks given above.
On all this bad stuff, there is an upside to sidestepping.
Blocking is the worst way of defending since you cannot attack
and have to wait for your opponent to stop attacking, plus some
attacks can cause guard stun.  Interrupting is better than that
since it causes damage and leaves you on the attack.  Sidestepping
is better still, since it leaves you on the attack, to your
opponent's defenceless side you can not only sidethrow, but pick 
a juggle or attack to visit on him at will, and he really can't
stop you.
You can sidestep randomly and purposefully.  Throwing out random
sidesteps can confuse and annoy your opponent.  He'll be wary to
throw out attacks in case it misses.  Sidestepping purposefully
is, of course, stepping on purpose at the right time to avoid an
attack and set up a specific attack.  Sidestepping purposefully
not only means you have to know how an attack tracks and such
like, but that you have to predict your opponent's attack and
its timing.  Its really best used when you either know your
opponent very well, or at the very least, his character.
You have to learn to sidestep, but it is very hard work.  As
with most defensive moves it is too broad to suggest specific
tactics on, sidestepping works from experience and judgement.
Another move that's new to Tekken 4 and is related to the Sidestep
is the lateral walk, a constant sidestep that allows you to traverse
the playing field generally over a large area.  In general this move
seems a little slow to gain a direct striking advantage in the way
that the sidestep does, rather it should be used to travel around
the arena to gain an advantage prior to attacking by positioning
yourself so that your opponent's back will end up against a wall
after your next round of attacks.
On the other side of things, remember that Lei's swinging arcing
attacks make him very hard to sidestep.  If your opponent is big on
sidestepping for advantage try to stay away from his linear strikes
and lines and use his swinging attacks instead, take advantage of
Lei's strengths, his whirling swinging style is one of them.

Chickens and Buffering
-----------------------

A lot of the following is quite advanced advice and tactics, if
you're not at this level its probably best ignored since it will
do more harm than good, all except for the piece on button 
buffering, everyone should know that.
I don't know why Capcom decided to refer to a reversal reversal
as, of all things, a Chicken, but they did.  A Chicken is the
act of snatching back your limb from a reversal and basically
giving your opponent a smack in the chops into the bargain.
Now, Chicken's are not half as important these days as they were
in Tekken 3 and Tekken Tag.  Reason being that in Tekken Tag you
had six characters who's attacks you could chicken, these days
you have a grand total of two, Nina and Paul.  Most reversals
now can't be chickened at all.  I think the reason for this
is a style thing, the reason for Capcom putting in the universal
low parry and Chickens in the first place I think from interviews
I've read with the Tekken staff is that they want the fights in
Tekken to look more like ones on Martial arts films.  This means
lots of smooth reversals back and forth.
But, reversals that can't be Chickened tend to only be for one
limb or another, which means you can switch up from kicks to
punches.  With a reversal happy Nina or Paul though the only
protection is a Chicken.  To Chicken you hit forward on the
stick and 1+3 for a left limb reversal or 2+4 for a right limb
reversal, that's to say if your left leg gets grabbed you hit
forward 1+3.  Now, doing this on reaction is next to impossible
so you have to do something called buffering.  Buffering is
the act of holding a move in the games memory to use at a
later point, you can button buffer and move buffer.  You'll
need button buffering in several instances, but you'll need
both types for a Chicken, which is why I'm explaining them
both here.

Button Buffering
-----------------

Button buffering is the most simple and vital form of buffering
its simply the act of holding a previously inputted command to
use it later.  When a double button command is buffered it comes
out not only easier, but faster that an unbuffered one.  Let
me use an example.  The most buffered move is a throw.  Say
I want to do Lei's basic throw, 2+4, there are two ways I can
do this, one is to press both buttons together at the same time,
using both fingers or a big fat thumb.  Doing this will mean two
things, one, the throw will not come out as fast as it could,
two, the odds of hitting them both exactly together is not one
hundred percent.  The second way of doing it is to hold down 
2, say from a previous punch or such like, then tap 4 and 
the throw will come out.  Not only will the throw trigger
faster, but also there's no way of messing it up and getting
a kick or punch instead.  This can be used and works the same
for any double button press move.  Certain complex moves can
use very tricky sets of button buffers that end up looking harder
than the move did originally, but they make moves faster and
much more certain.  Buttons can be held indefinatly for
button buffering, take Lei's turning uppercut juggle -
1+2~2, 1+2~2
Now, you could do it the hard way, or you could hold 1 and
just tap 2 four times.  Since from backturned there is no
double punch move to be done the computer will take your
2 inputs from there to mean an uppercut.  You can only
trigger a buffer with a button press, not with a motion,
meaning that holding 2 then tapping d/f won't get you
the uppercut.
Buffering has so many uses I can't get close to listing 
them here, but when you next go to do a move that requires
double button presses, remember it.  At top levels players
will never release a button unless they're certain they 
won't need it later.

Move Buffering
---------------

The other sort of buffering is rather more complex.  When
you hit a button set and another move is executing the
buttons you hit will be stored in the computer's memory
for a split second and if they get the chance then they'll
execute.  This is most often used in throw strings and
Chickens.  To do a Chicken, as said previously, you have
to hit forward and the buttons for a throw.  Now, you 
can't be expected to do this on reaction and you don't
want to throw after every move you chicken, so you buffer
the chicken move, this is to say that immediatly after 
you hit the attack you hold it and then press forward and
the other button needed, you do all this BEFORE the execution
of the attack your chickening is finished.  IF the attack is 
reversed, the Chicken will be stored and unleashed, if its
not, nothing will happen.  To buffer a chicken you need to
do both sorts of buffering.
For an example of move buffering without button buffering,
if you're caught in a King five throw then you'll want to
break out as soon as possible.  If you hit a button escape 
and the throw does come, then you break it.  But if you hit
the escape and the throw never comes, King stops or messes
up, then the punch (Kings multi throws are all punch escapes) 
you hit never comes out, the escape was buffered through
his previous move animation rather than your own.
Buffering is a complex, but a necessary skill.

Chicken Buffering and Baiting
------------------------------

You should now understand the concept, for a slow executing
mid or high level attack on Paul or Nina you should hold the
button down and press forward along with the second button of
its throw execution a fraction of a second before you connect
with your opponent.
But there is a better, higher level tactic avaliable here.
Any Paul or Nina player worth anything will reverse the Rave
Spin, I know I will, its almost certain, so what do you do?
Avoid the Rave Spin?  Never do it?  No, you do it on
purpose, from a way off, in a very obvious fashion.  Why?
Why do such a suicidal thing?  Chicken Baiting.
You want your opponent to reverse it, you want him to grab
you so you can Chicken him.  Why would you do such a risky 
thing?  Simple, every throw in Tekken can be escaped (excepting
certain final parts of multi-throws and back throws, but those 
are another matter) every attack can be interrupted, sidestepped 
or blocked, every stun can be escaped and every chain broken.
Apart from a Chicken, a Chicken buffered mid attack on Paul or
Nina is as close as you'll ever get to an invincible attack,
they get hit, they block or they reverse and get chickened.
At top level play where ninety nine percent of moves will get
blocked, baiting someone into a Chicken is very important.
Once again, this whole section suffers from the reduction
of Chickening from Capcom in Tekken 4, a move I just don't
understand.
One other thing, note that playing really high level players
specific chicken baiting will not work.  A good Paul or Nina
player isn't stupid, they know you're going to chicken bait
and if the baiting is too obvious they'll just not reverse 
it and block, dodge or duck the attack, the Rave Spin, for
instance, is a good one for them to duck and uppercut to
juggle.  As your opposition gets more skilled, so must even
your chicken baiting become more subtle.

Buffering and High level play
------------------------------

There is another very important tactic to understand here
for high level play.  In the arcades the best players will
watch your hands, I know because I do it, at least on and 
off.  They'll do this to see which button you're buffering
and so which move you're going to do next.  Let me explain.
Say I'm up against a Paul player who I see is buffering 2.
This give him one of four options, a throw, his unblockable,
the hammer of the gods or the tackle.  Now, the unblockable
isn't a worry, I can counter that on reaction, same with the
tackle, if he tries to bust it out I'll roll him over and
pummel him, that gives two moves that I need to know about,
the throw or the hammer of the gods.  If I see his finger
near the kicks, then I know, if I see him tap the joystick
I know that a throw is coming and I duck.  In fact, in this
instance since the hammer of the gods move is so slow I'd be
ducking anyway.  This is the main use of hand watching.  Added
to that you can get a very slight warning on some slow 
execution moves, but in my book that's a lesser advantage, and 
most importantly there's not a lot you can do to stop it.  Other
reasons to hand watch are to watch out which moves a person
Chicken's and to see when he's backdashing, again there's 
not a lot you can do about this.  Chickening happens less in
Tekken 4, but if you get a hand watching Paul who's going to
reverse all and only the moves you don't Chicken, then just
Chicken everything you can and keep everything you can't quick,
and mix up your Chickens, Chicken unusual moves.  The backdash
watching is another one you can't help, said Paul would probably
be ready to Deathfist any backdashes he sees, on this one just 
keep your general play tight.  There is something you can do 
to stop people spotting your buffers however.
Now, clearly this is very high level stuff really, you have
to know all the moves of your opponent, not even your own
player, to use it effectively.  Its also, really, a bit of
foul play, in 'real' life there's no way that Lei could look
at some superpowerful hand hovering behind Paul to predict 
what he's going to do.  Personally I try not to do it when
I know that the other person isn't.  All that said you need 
to know about it since in tournament play on arcade machines 
it will happen, it just will.  Its not really a PS or PS2
problem thanks to joypads.
You need to know how to deal with it, now there is no way
of doing it without massive experience, but there is a way
to counter it without such experience, but by knowing your
own character.  First of all, Lei is much less of a victim
to hand watchers than most people, with Paul or Law everyone
knows what the moves are, but I challenge any none Lei player
to know what's coming from a left punch button buffered
backturned Lei, or a right kick Drunken Stance Lei, his massive
move list takes a serious advantage in this case.  Added to that
is the fact that compared to most other characters Lei doesn't
need to button buffer so much, having relatively few throws
and using most of his double button presses to switch from
one stance to another.  Its still useful to button buffer to
avoid low kicking instead of dropping to the floor, but its
not so much of an advantage for the opponent as it is
against a King or a Paul player.
What you want to do if you are in tournament play with someone
who is watching your hands is buffer feign.  For instance if
I was playing as Paul it would be a neat trick to start the
round with one pressed and constantly tapping forward, then
at the last second popping out a hammer fist to stuff a probably
ducking opponent expecting the push away throw.
Now, as Lei's weakness in this area is less, so is his possible
tricks from it, but there are a few to be aware of:

Facing forward, buffering either punch -
With one buffered you're signalling either a high attack, with
the throws, back turning hook punches (1+2) or snake punches
(f+1+2) or a slow starting mid attack with the headbutt (b+1+2).  
You could also be going for the drop to the floor or with 2
pressed you could be going for the stance change, but these are
all none agressive moves.  You opponent would then probably be
intending to duck, or ducking, if he saw anything apart from
the rear back from the headbutt.  Your best bet then against
a hand watcher is to release 1 and go for the d/f+2 uppercut 
and hopefully juggle him, or if he's ducking knock him down,
or release 2 and go with the d/f+1 uppercut, no juggle, but
it'll teach him a lesson.

Facing forward, buffering either kick -
Lei buffering a kick means either a none offensive move, Drunken
Stance, Playing Dead, Backturning, or Stance Switching, or a throw.
In this case your opponent is going to be best served ducking.
A neat option is to sidestep and hit the other kick, the falling
blade is so rarely seen that he might have forgotten about it.
Other than that, be ready to pop out an uppercut.

Face Down/Feet Towards, buffering either kick -
This tends to mean only one thing, the Kangeroo Kick.  Try to 
always buffer 4 for this from the drop, since it means that
if you do have a hand watcher you can tap up and hit 3, giving
you the low striking sweep that's a slight juggle launcher.

From Lei's other stances he either doesn't have attacks you can
buffer or doesn't have realistic counters and set ups involving
them.  Overall, remember that hand watching is only an advantage
if you don't know its going on and why it happens, watch for it
and react accordingly.


Spacing
--------

Spacing, also known as Reach or Zoning is another concept to be 
aware of.  Not only can attacks hit low, mid or high they also 
come out close, medium or long range.  If you understand those
ranges you can often either avoid your opponent or step on his
toes.  Since Lei can fight at varied ranges better than anyone 
else in the game you're probably best off learning which range
your opponent is best at, and staying out of it.  Noone is ever
out of range of Lei, the Rolling Kicks, Tornado Kicks and 
Cartwheel kicks will reach anyone, at mid range Lei has space to
stance change and swing out with his wide swinging attacks, and
while his poking isn't the best in the game he can play that
style powerfully and well.
Your aim is to remember what range each of your moves handles best
from, and which range each stance is best from, and what range 
each move leaves you at.  That and which range your opponent likes
to be at.  In the section on versus strategy I've said something
about the ranges each opposing character works best at, but remember
that anyone can fight at any range depending on the handler of
the character so be willing to adjust to fighting Kuma long range
or Law close in if the person you're up against goes against the
grain.  Try and split up in your head a moves range, where it
leaves you and where your opponent wants you to be, then plan
your movement back and forth with all these in mind.  As a rule
of thumb the stances and ranges are something like this:

Long Range:  Normal Stance, Crane Stance.
Mid Range:  Normal Stance, Rush Walk, Pheonix Illusion, Lying
Down, Dragon Stance, Drunken Stance
Short Range:  Normal Stance, Panther Stance, Tiger Stance,
Snake Stance, Going into Drunken Stance, Lying Down. 


Dashes and Wiffing
-------------------

The aim of knowing your opponent's best range is to make him
wiff or to interrupt him.  If he's a short to mid range player,
keep long and dashing long and make him wiff, if he's a long
range player, keep in his face and keep him defending and 
interrupted.  Dashing back and forward is a very useful tactic,
if a very basic one.  Now, when you're in the process of dashing
you cannot block, so beware if your opponent has short to mid 
range, such as Paul, one of those mid range attacks could pick
you off as you dash from short to mid.
That said, dashing back and in again can be confusing and
annoying to people, almost like Lei's dropping standing, with
the above mentioned Ha Ha step and backdash to backturn Lei's
ability to shift away from your opponent and back again is 
probably the best in the game.  Lei can move well, between
dropping, dashing, stepping and sidestepping.  If you dash
back and cause an opponent to wiff you've gained a great 
advantage, especially on a slow execution or recovery attack.
Dashing back and forth on a held back attack can yeild good 
results, such as dashing into and away from Yoshi's bad breath.


Pre start options
------------------

In Tekken 4 you can move before the start of the match, though you
cannot strike the opponent.  Obviously this is a chance for a lot
of manouvering and gaining a psychological or tactical advantage.
Most people will either get up to your face and press into your, 
either prior to bulldogging or to tempt you into attacking on the 
start of the fight when they intend to dodge back and take advantage.
Others will sidestep, backdash and move erratically.  Many will wave 
dash or at least repeatedly crouch dash, if they have one, especially
a Heihachi, Kazuya or Jin.  Partly to hit a mix-up off it as soon as
the match starts, since this is a chance to get into a crouch dash 
where they can't be punked out of it, and partly to do the getting in 
your face intimidation as above.
Lei has another option, as usual, and in my book its the best, most 
people really waste the starting time, Lei can stance switch.  Stance
switching is the best way to gain both a tactical and psychological
advantage at the start of the fight I know of.  Look at it, they're
scuttling back and forth like a cockroach on acid.  You just stand
there and then slide across into Panther, say, then wait.  Also, it 
looks like you have a good plan, and most people don't know the moves
from Lei's stances, so the mind game is already half won.  Added to 
that there are the tactical advantages of being in a stance at the
start of the match that might normally take real effort to get into.
My personal favourite for this on the first round is tiger stance.  
Tiger and hold forward will almost always give you the auto mid/high
parry since most people start rounds with mid or high attacks.  
Depending on your opponent you can repeat this trick since lots of 
people will think you just got a normal parry off on timing and won't
know it was auto matic.  If your opponent is too smart for that 
though mix it up a little in the second rounds, panther is the other
obvious choice, or attack first instead of waiting for the parry.
Backturned and dropping are no-nos, since backturned will pull you 
away and noone will rush you when you go into backturn, and once
you lose the shock of drop down it tends to just get you in trouble.
If you're losing badly, however, or if its a three or four round 
fight, it is your sworn duty to start at least one round in Crane
stance as a direct homage to the Karate Kid.
One other nice little tactic, especially on people who like to rush 
up to your face, or on shorter characters and crouch dashers, is 
leaping clean over their head.  For some reason leaping over people 
seems easier on Tekken 4 than before in Tag, and it can frustate and 
surprise people who wanted to start the round in your face.

=======================
9) ADVANCED STRATEGIES
=======================

By this point you should have a fairly clear idea of how to play
with Lei.  Here I'm going to go through the sort of refined 
strategies you'll need to take a well founded game to a level of
all around strong play.


Psychology
-----------

Lei thrives on deception, tricky and cunning.  He is a king
of the psychological game, his ability to attack constantly
from anywhere and to confuse opponents are an important part 
of his arsenal.  Part of this is letting your opponent know
that you know what you're doing.  The following are all 
tactics that can give you the psychological edge, all will
get you nowhere on computer characters and should probably
not be used on human fighters either because they're nasty 
and horrible or because they require you to be totally
superior to them.

Fire Fighting - This one is the best way to gain a psychological
advantage, both morally best and effectively best, but its the
hardest.  Basically you fight fire with fire, hence the name. 
Pick the opponent's best area and take him on in that, throw King,
poke Law, switch up string Nina and out-power Paul.  The reason 
for this being so hard is obvious, you have to be really better 
than the opponent, but you'll find that once you've beaten 
someone at their own game in one round they'll soon feel they 
can't beat you and the following rounds will be a walk over.  
If you can play one amazing round this sort of play can get 
you the whole fight, they say that a great burst only wins one 
round, but that's not always true.

Cunning - The only other tactic here that I'd actually suggest
anyone use.  Cunning is a major Lei tactic generally, as Lei you
should lure people into your attacks, you should lay traps and
suck people into them.  Lei is a better trap setter than any
other character, by setting them and pulling people into them
you can start to make them paranoid every time you go into a 
weird new stance, or even an old one if they've been popped by
tricks from it before.  Paranoid people start to turtle up
and stop attacking, and then you've got them.

Over Turtling - A very irritating way to gain the edge, but it can
be a very effective one.  Basically throw away avenues of attack
and such to defend everything.  If you can go through about twenty
seconds of blistering attacks from the opponent when you start 
attack in return you can find your opponent half beaten already.
This isn't too hard since you're only defending, its important
that you clearly throw away avenues of attack here, if you block
a great pressure game with no gaps in it then the opponent will 
think you're just under pressure.  Throwing away come back chances 
shows that you're so confident of his inability to hurt you that
you know you can turn around at any point and destroy him.
If the opponent does land a hit on you its best to sigh as if
bored or tut as if what he just did was the cheapest move in the
game.

Over Pitbulling - Almost as irritating as the previous but in
a different way.  As superpitbull throw out guard stun moves, 
straight forward moves and fast moves.  There are a lot of moves
that you'll never cause damage with in a million years but can
only really be blocked, or at least which put the opponent into
a blocking frame of mind.  Use these, put the opponent in a 
position where he has to block constantly for a chunk of a match
then step back, pause, and go into your normal game.  The odds 
are that your opponent will be a little shaken and your better
thought out real attacks will gain some good results.
Lei is great for this tactic because of his chaining abilitys
and his guard stun moves, but it can be unnatural because
most good moves have downsides, you're not looking to do
damage here specifically, you're looking to make someone block.

Single Moving - Also known as being Cheap as Cheese.  Here you
basically use one move.  Eddy/Christy players do this naturally,
personally I'd love to use the Wang/Julia roll around punch
for a whole round on someone.  If you can use one move over and
over you can irritate the hell out of your opponent.  Once again
what you're doing here is throwing away real attack chances to
get into a position to use your move again.  Often good moves 
for this are weak ones with no recovery, Lei's best option
is the d+1 from back turned for this tactic.  If you manage to
tag someone with three or four five d+1 juggles in a round
you can sometimes find people walking off in disgust.  This
is a horrible tactic to use but if you're willing to do 
anything to win it can really get into people's heads.
The difference between this and true cheapness is that
you will be throwing away damage chances you could have taken.
If you can win a whole round with one move and then on the
second round you bust out every stance and juggle you know to
let the person know you're better than that you can see their
previous frustation melt away into total despair.

Playing Slow - This is another nice one, as you do moves take
your hand about an inch away from the controller each time,
then casually reach down for each move at one at a time.
This can go well with Trash talking calling.

Single Hand Play - That's right, play with one hand.  Hold
a drink with the other or keep it in your pocket or, my 
personal favourite, hold it behind your back as you stand 
side on to the machine in a Jet Lee type stance.  There is
a specific FAQ on doing just this out there somewhere, since
apparently Lei is the best person to do it with, so look
out for that.  If you win a round like this, look at them,
then without saying a word, switch hands.

Move Foolishness - General move foolishness, random side
stepping, random dropping and standing, random dashing
back and forth, general weird random movement.  This doesn't
work like it used to with less space and more speed in Tekken
4 over previous Tekkens but it can work damn well.  Included
in this is any point where you waste a chance to do damage.
You can work damn hard to get into a clear chance and then
at the last second dash away and start again as if you
didn't like that one.

Trash Talking - I never do this, ever, and I would not
advise you did it.  Personally I'm really quiet in the 
arcades, mainly because I hate playing the CPU and I don't
want to piss off competition by trash talking, but also
partly because I've seen someone headbutted in the face 
for going to far with this (I think he handed the guy a
token and pointed to the machine at the back of the arcade
suggesting he go practice before coming back.  Really 
should have looked at the guy he was doing this to first).  
But if you want you can Trash talk to exaggerate any of 
the other tactics.  If you use the tactic of dashing away 
from clear chances you might want to cheerfully explain to 
the opponent that you 'didn't like that one'.  Meaningless 
noises can be very irritating, if you're going to lie down 
and stand up constantly making a high pitched 'Woooop' noise 
each time can really make things a lot worse.  In fact silly 
noises generally on random movement is a nice little tactic 
to irritate people further.  Be warned though that while 
frustration is useful in Tekken getting your nose busted in 
really isn't.

Other than that, trash talking really takes five main
forms -

Pointless - Talk about television programs, ask their
opinion on art and literature, distract them, but do 
it casually as if you're being friendly.  If you just
constantly ask none sequiter questions you'll just get
ignored.  Be warned that if your opponent takes you up
on this, talking more than you, answering cheerfully,
you should probably stop.
Game - Talk about the game, ask about how they do certain
moves, talk about the new graphics on Tekken 4, the story
line, the scrolling of the stage, anything.  This is really
a subsection of pointless, just more likely to get a reply
on it.  Once again, someone too helpful is probably still
going to bust your ass up.
Trash - Talking proper all out Trash Talking Trash.  Phrases
like 'You like that?  Huh?  Huh?' and 'You KNOW I ain't 
gonna stand 'fo that' are good ones here.  You know how 
to talk trash dammit.
Sinister - My favourite, if someone throws you mutter
something like, 'Oh, you want to throw huh?' then 
throw them all around the place.  Or if they Juggle
you a simple 'You like juggles huh?'.  You get the
idea.
Calling - Another personal favourite, only try
this against someone when you've really outmatched
them, call where to block your attacks and how
to break your throws before you do them.  Against 
a total newcomer doing this as you lean back and
one handedly tap your way through a ten string,
lifting your hand clear from the buttons by a few 
inches between each tap is an utterly evil and soul
destroying way to show him he's in the wrong place at
the wrong time.  In reality only best used to newbies
during custom strings, certainly not against someone with
sharp reactions or who's beating your ass anyway.

Sides - some players can only fight from one side.  Don't
ask me why, but some people just can't handle being on the
wrong side of you.  Anyone that asks you to move across the
machine before starting is one of these.  If you do come 
across someone like this its a good idea to throw away
follow up chances to get on that side.  If he's down
instead of wake-up, hop over him and go on, when you
reverse him don't follow up, sidestep around him and get
on the wrong side, if you get the chance for a back throw,
waste it.  This sort of person exists less and less these
days with the death of 2-D fighters, but you get a few
dinosaurs still.

A final word on this sort of thing, don't use this if your
opponent deserves respect, partly because it makes you look
like a prick, even if you are better, but partly because he
might just bust you up, in and out the game.  Now, how do 
you tell if someone is worthy of respect?  Let me tell you
a little story.  Just as Tekken Tag came out on the PS2 I
was stood in a games store playing the display model, I'd
been there for a while and there was a little crowd, I was
playing well.  A kid came up who could only have been about
12, at this point the crowd either didn't know Tekken or
didn't want to face me because the kid got a few goes.
Since it was the PS2 version he put his health up to 150%,
which was fine with me, I set to scrolling through tag-teams
that I didn't really know for the fun of it.  The kid was
constantly throwing out unblockables and it was a fairly
fun piece of stupidness, especially since I had the chance to
pull of all the impressive stuff you never normally get to do
and everyone else was happy to watch this.  Another match ended
and I picked King and Armor King, who I go through phases of
being good and not being good with, mainly because I get big
ideas in my head that I can't pull off with him.  At this point
I was obsessed with the Irish Whip into powerslam.  Anyway,
in stormed a teenage guy who shoved the kid off the joypad, 
grabbed it and instantly picked Eddy and Hwoarang.  Still with
one hundred and fifty percent energy.
I think we all know how this story goes from here.
He won the first round and turned to me and actually said
'Like that, huh?  Like that?'
I cut down my game and scrapped through the next two rounds,
winning, when I got another comment on how lucky I was.  On the 
next selection I picked Paul and Law, dropped my health to fifty 
percent and gave him all the respect he deserved.
It has to be said that even after watching me drop my health he
still didn't change his back to normal even.
That's the sort of person who doesn't deserve your respect.

Poking
-------

Okay, I've gone over Lei's poke options in some depth
already, their uses and abilities, but I want to stress
again how important they are.  With the advent of the 
PS version of Tekken and wonderful sets of FAQs and such
even average level players have enough exposure to the game
to block most strings.  Now, for a switch-up mad Lei player
this is less of a problem than most people, but the learing
curve remains.
The learning curve is something like this, you start, you
get a few attacks and sequences and don't now most the moves,
your attacks are basic because you don't know many.
Then you learn more and more moves and each new set of moves 
you use.  Then your opponent learns each new set of moves and
so they become useless.  Then you find tricks to use those 
moves, then your opponent learns those tricks and in the end
at the top level both you and your opponent are reduced to 
using those first basic attacks you learnt.
In short what I'm saying is that at high level play you have
to accept that all your pretty stance changing loveliness will
give way to very basic attacks, because those are the only ones
that will actually land.  And with them you need to be aware of
how to set up other attacks.
Lei has all the basic pokes and more, but he has one major gap
in his poking set that you should be aware of.  Most characters 
have a rising uppercut that juggles, for some reason Lei has no
major while standing move his while standing uppercut does not
juggle for some reason, he also lacks for effective full crouch
moves.  What this means in effect is that the fastest poke in the
game, the crouching jab (d+1) is unable to set up any follow up
attacks for Lei, he has to stand up and do something else.
The upside is that most his other pokes set up huge attacks since
they stance change, just bear this in mind when in a poking war
and if you do use the ducking jab follow it up with the while
standing mid kick to at least do some damage.  While Lei has 
plenty of low attacks from standing, he doesn't have quite the
same arsenal going back up again, something that's fairly unusual.
As with all categories the secret here is to understand Lei's
strengths and his differences from other characters.  As a
rule stay out of poke wars, you don't need them since your
mix-ups are so powerful you can always come out with something
new and useful, someone staying in your face and poking is
probably afraid of your deadly Lei mix-ups, and well they
should be.


Custom Strings
---------------

A custom string is simply a set of moves that chains easily
together to keep pressure on the opponent, using juggles and 
setting up other attacks in one big effortless string.
Lei is, without shadow of doubt, the master of this sort of 
play, this is his area, his strength, Lei's stance switching
allows him to Custom String constantly and powerfully, rolling
ranges, heights and powers while popping in juggle chances and
unusual positions that most people will have trouble to judge.
Below are some useful strings and mix-ups that you can use to
base your own tactics on.  The idea of a good Custom String is
to have a String of attacks coming from the word go and to
constantly have planned out your next set of attacks, and set-ups
from and for those attacks.  The better planned your options are
the better they will work.
One thing, people have mailed me giving sequences of moves they use
with various options to them.  My point in this section is to suggest
move sequences that flow and follow and have definable useful follow-
ups.  Moves with an infinite number of follow ups, poking strings 
essentially, are beyond the ken of this sort of FAQ, at least, any 
further than I have talked about in the poking section and the rush
section.

Strings:

3,3,(BK)d+4,d(SK),2,2,f+2(PS),2,3,3,(BK)....
A simple strong string with lots of good options to switch up.
The backturned gives you a chance to break off, as does the
Panther and the Snake, you can always take the Panther Paw
to a more complex juggle, it alters hit ranges and loops right
back to its start.  On the start of the string sidestepping before
the crescent kick can be a good option, after that since it lands
as a juggle on a successful Panther Paw there's no need to worry.
Of course you can hit the scratch into rolling kicks and go with
a dropping string, or any other combination thereof.  One major thing
to remember is that after bringing this out once or twice unless you 
take your opponent off his feet with the crescent kick then he'll 
block low on the Rave Sweep and make you stagger unless you mix up
with the spiral uppercut.

Other variations include:
...(PS)1,4~4,3,3,3~4,3
      ...3
                  ...3+4
...(SK) 2,2(DR),2(TS),4,4,4~4,3
              ...(TS),1 - refer to juggle section
...(BK)d+1,d+1,d+1...(To personal choice),d+4,d(SK)...
...(BK)2 - refer to juggle section

u/f+4,f,N+1,2,1,2,4+d(CS)3,4,2,3,f,N+1,2,1,2,4+d(CS)3...
Another nice string, from the hopkick, or uppercut, go through
with the Rush, break off into Crane, if the crane dance lands
its juggle then you can do the Rush again for another juggle and
go into it all over again.
Other variations include:
d/f+2,f,N+1,2,1,2...
(BK)2,f,N+1,2,1,2...
...f,N+1,2,1+d(PS) go into any above custom chain from Panther
...f,N+1,2,1,2+d(TS) go into any above custom chain from Tiger
...4+d(CS)2,(BK) go into any above custom chain from Backturned
...4+d(CS)2,(BK+Opponent BK) u/f+4,f,N+1,2,1,2,4+d...

You can clearly see how any of these strings can chain into any
of the others.  Now, these are not one hundred percent like juggles
are, in fact a tech rolling skilled blocker won't be phased by a 
lot of them, but that's not the point, they put smooth judged
pressure on your opponent.
Look for weaknesses during these times, as you switch into your
strings you can afford to look at their reactions more, as
they react to something you can do quite naturally all their
effort is in blocking you, while you can exploit gaps and
press your advantage.
Custom strings though, as the name suggests, are strings
you originate, they define your game play, when you understand
Lei's moves and attacks you should come up with strings of your
own.  Understand where his moves leave you and how they chain
and you will be able to create effective custom chains of your 
own.


Keep-Out Gameplay
------------------

A simple tactic that just suggests you keep the opponent back
with your long range attacks, forcing them to dash in, they
cannot block when dashing in and you get a free attack.  Lei
is probably the best character in the game at this sort of 
play so its important you recognise its existence and style.
Its very important when attempting this sort of play that you
understand totally Lei's moves and their action, since what
you want is not to have a ranged move that moves you closer
to your opponent, but a good range move that moves your
opponent further from you.  The Cartwheel kick has great 
range, but its a terrible Keep-out move.  The Headbutt is
a much better keep-move.  With Lei's mix up ability, great
range, guard stun attacks and power his Keep out game can
be great, but you have to know his game.  To play Lei's
keep out you have to have great knowledge of both yours 
and your opponent's relative ranges and what will happen
from them, but be aware of blocked move push back and
the tactics of forcing your opponent to dash that Lei
can employ.


Dominating the game
--------------------

Dominate the game, simple, enough said, next section.

Seriously, there is a secret to dominating your opponent totally
and though it is easier said than done, its in theory quite simple.
The secret is to spot his patterns.  Everyone has patterns, the best
players disguise and protect their patterns better than everyone
else, but they still have them.  Lei's greatest strength, I say 
for the eightieth time, is his mix-up ability, remember and exploit
that, what I mean is, never get predictable, never repeat your 
actions, learn your opponent's style and exploit it.

Wake-up
--------

Also known as Okizeme, a japanese term meaning, roughly 'to lay the
boot in even when they're on the floor'.  An opponent on the floor 
can't cause much damage, at least, when they're not Lei, and they 
certainly can't block or reverse you.  Keeping them down there 
and taking damage can only be a good thing.  It may not be a very
honourable way to fight, but it is effective.
At several points I've referred to Wake-up moves and tactics, but
here I'm going to go over them again.  First of all, Lei's ground
hitting moves:

d/b+4
(BK) d+4
u/f+2
SS 3+4
(BK) 3+4
3~3,4
u+2
d+4
DS 3+4
PS 3
TS 4

All of these hit a floored opponent.  Now, other moves will hit 
also, but be aware of your orientation and your opponent's bulk.
For instance, Hwoaroang has a very slim waist and standing by his
head and hitting d+3 will wiff as your thigh will be above his head
and your foot his waist.  It will hit everywhere else, but not
standing by his head.  If Kuma is your opponent then a good deal
more moves will connect with him on the floor, but these ones
are certain.  Added to these are further wake up trick moves:

(BK) d+1
PS 1+2
SK 2,2,2

Now, if the opponent stays on the floor, these will miss, but if
they try to get up they will knock them back to the ground and do
more damage.  Clearly a guessing game is then set up, if you think
your opponent will get up then do one of the second set of moves
and you'll get more damage from them, but if he decides to stay down
then you'll miss and get get damaged yourself.  A good wake-up 
game is a mix of causing fear on the opponent's side, making 
him do what you want, and predicting him.  The second lot of
moves will make your opponent fear rising, and the first lot
will punish him staying on the floor.  Lei's wake-up game isn't
as good as Kings, but it is one of the best in the game and you 
should always be ready to punish a grounded opponent.
There are a few extra special Lei wake-up tactics you should know.
I've mentioned the power of Panther or Tiger stance over a 
grounded opponent, so I won't repeat those here, but bear them
in mind.
First off, the rolling kicks.  If you catch the last hit of the 
rolling kicks then 3~4 is a juggle wake up, if your opponent
stays on the floor and you only do the first kick, then you
can roll at him and hit him with a sweep (3) as you both finish
the roll to take him back to the floor.  If he tries to rise or
roll back then the whole rolling kicks will connect and you'll
be able to land the 3~4 attack as well.
Second, back turned evil.  If you have your back turned to a
downed opponent then they're in trouble.  If they roll or stand
up then the hook low fists will kill them (d+1), in fact with
Kuma you can low back fist your way through an entire fight.  
If they stay down then the flip flop flip (3+4) will destroy
them, and the Rave Sweep (d+4) will set up further attacks.
For Tech rollers note that Lei's crescent kick low kick (3,3)
cannot be tech rolled, so that after it the Flip Flop Flip
is certain, no matter what the opponent does, and you still
have the chance for the back turned Rave Spin, which also 
cannot be tech rolled.

The real secret to a good Wake-up game is understanding your
opponents styles and how to attack them.  Some people roll up,
some just stand, some rise and attack, others tech roll, the
best will do all of these on the right situation, you need
to know what they will do, or if they mix it up, you need to
know what is 'the right thing to do' to predict and counteract
it.  You will soon develop your own wake-up tricks, but remember
that Lei has more wake-up strikes and options than any other
character without exception.  Make good use of them.

Just resting
-------------

Just as you are going to try and land wake up strikes on your 
opponent you can be damn sure he's going to try and land them 
on you, but being Lei you have some tricks up your sleeve.
Recovery from knock down is an important part of the game
for everyone, for Kuma, say, getting up is such hard work he
has to have a great recovery game to avoid being battered while
rising.  Lei has to understand recovery for a different reason,
for him getting up is a chance to attack.
Think about it, Lei spends a good time of a fight trying to
get on the floor, he's the only fighter to have two juggle
starters from the ground, the only one to have specific
ground moves.  A great Lei player will almost never stand 
straight up.  You should learn to recognise instantly which
drop down position Lei is in and what moves are possible from
there, start to think of being knocked down not as a punishment,
but as a favour, thank your opponent with a cartwheel kick,
or a Rave Sweep, or a Kangeroo Kick.  Always knowing your 
options keeps them open, with Lei more than almost anyone.
Recovery is a chance for you, remember that.

Eating Wake-up
---------------

An odd phrase, but hear me out.  As stated before there are two
sorts of wake-up attack, the ones that strike if you stay down,
and the ones that strike if you get up.  Now, if one that strikes
as you get up lands you have to recover all over again, from the
same move, which takes long enough for your opponent to do the
same thing again.  But if you get hit by a strike that hits you
grounded most the time it will knock you back and have less 
recovery time, meaning you can get up without taking another 
set of damage.  This is everyone else's choice, stay down and
make your opponent deal only small damage, or get up and risk
taking big damage.  For Lei none ground striking low attacks 
are something else, they're a chance for a juggle.
I would say never ever try to get up right away against anyone 
apart from King until your opponent gives up on his Wake-up
game and just starts to deal normal damage with low kicks, 
and even then just eat it and get up normally.  The reason
being that if, say, Law tries a Dragon Tail Sweep, or anyone any 
none certain wake-up option you can force feed them a Kangeroo
kick eighty percent of the time, and gain a huge juggle chance.


Stage Tactics
--------------

Here I intend to explain the best tactics for positioning on 
various Tekken 4 Stages.

Pit Fighter Stage
------------------

Probably the most closed in looking of the stages.  I like to think 
this is Paul's or Bryan's stage.  Its a dirt floor surrounded close 
in by the crowd very much in the style of one of the first ever 3-D
beat-em ups, Pit Fighter.  This is a neat stage in that its clearly
square, so you're not going to encounter a sudden wall you didn't
expect.  One thing to watch out for is that when you get close to the
edge of the arena it is possible for the crowd to block your view.
Though they mostly go transparent they don't always, so if you're 
going to the wall be sure you know what you're doing next, just in
case you can't see what position you're in.  If in doubt go for a
safe custom string until things clear up.  Although this is a close 
in stage because its so flat and clearly square it can often give you
lots of space.  The walls here are a bit too unpredictable to use, so 
try to play this match in the middle of the floor, if it does go to 
the wall don't expect to be able to do moves based on watching your 
opponent's reactions or position all the time.  A good stage with 
suprising amounts of space.  For Lei it can be played as a good stage 
for rushing and ranged moves.

Forest Stage
-------------

Certainly Yoshimitsu's stage this one, its a fairly open stage, a few
things to remember, above the stream its roughly triangular, do not
get caught in the 'point' of the triangle because you will get 
killed.
Also the ground from the stream up is somewhat sloped which means 
that if you find yourself fighting away from the stream you want to 
make damn sure you're the one with the back to it.  In the stream 
itself the most solid uniform wall of the stage is the fallen tree on 
the right of the stream.  At this point things can be confusing, the 
water splashes, the ground is uneven and you're back to a wall, the 
rule here is pretty simple, get away from that tree.  Generally, keep 
your back to the stream or your face to the tree.

Beach Stage
------------

Probably the spaciest stage of them all, as such a good Lei stage 
because, as mentioned in the Wall section, Lei just isn't too great 
with walls.  One rule is to stay down hill since the stage does slope 
slightly to the sea, remember low kicks will never miss however 
higher up the opponent is,  but high and mid ones will miss when the 
opponent is lower.  However don't get pushed too far into the sea 
because you will eventually meet an edge.

Street
-------

Palace
-------

Airport
--------

Lab
----

Car Park
---------

Octagon Stage
--------------

My personal favourite, Heihachi's stage, the crowd, the whole nine 
yards, this one makes me feel like its a real tournament again.  This 
stage is great, its regular, predictable with obvious walls and its a 
suprisingly large stage as well.
Generally, this is a good Lei stage since he can take his space and 
plan his moves, which is exactly what Lei needs.  There's nothing you 
need to watch for, no stress, just a solid good stage.

.....................................................................

======================
Vs CHARACTER STRATEGY
======================

Here I'll try to discuss a few general ideas of how to deal with 
other characters.  Of course the human operating the character can 
completely change its style, but these are general tips to look out 
for.

First of all, understand that playing a human is vastly different
from playing the computer.  You can beat the CPU using just one 
custom string often.  The CPU falls for stupid stuff and doesn't fall 
for great set-ups and neat switch ups.  Really this is all for human
players, on the computer just get in and go through your best strings
and juggles, in that case its about getting out more attacks really.

On human players the game will generally be slower, more measured
and controlled, it will be more psychological and almost without
exception a lot harder.  All but the worst human players are better,
both generally and in terms of satisfaction, than the CPU, at least 
as far as tactics and strategy go.


Standard Characters:
--------------------

Hwoarang
---------

Hwoarang used to be a great Lei tag partner in Tekken Tag, mainly 
because he has similar properties to Lei, though in different ways.
What I mean is that Lei's moves leave him naturally backturned, 
dropped, animal etc. while Hwoarang's leave him feet switched.  
Essentially they can both constantly chain moves back and forth.
The difference is that while Lei's tend to hit low and mid more than 
often, Hwoarang's tend to strike mid or high.
One thing a good Hwoarang player will often rely on is his great 
movement.  He can wave dash and his tripple side step can whip
around you.  His wave dashing isn't like the others though because he 
can only hit one real move off it, he can't switch up low and mid on
it.  The tripple sidesteps can be a killer though, sidestep, cancel
into flamingo, sidestep, can slide around you.  If someone likes to
do this though what you have to do is stay calm, don't be lured into
attacking and watching him slide around you, either wait and pop him
or let him slide around and hit him with back turned attacks.
Hwoarang wants to control the pace of the match, with his stance
switching, he also wants to keep you at long range.  You, obviously,
want to stop both these things, keep in his face, bust him up, and 
bust him up badly.  The other option is to stay away from him, but
don't do that, since that's what he wants.
One thing you really want to do is keep Hwoarang out of Flamingo
stance, when he gets in it he's got a lot of switch ups that
you really can't compete with, just like yourself in Tiger making
someone guess between a low striking juggle or a mid one.  Once he
gets in often your best tactic is to hold back and wait for him to
knock you away with a kick that sends you back.  But you should never
let him get there, you should always be in his face busting him up.
If he gets breathing space you have two options, if you're quick hit
rolling kicks or other dropping attack.  This either connects, or 
forces him to drop his flamingo and get close again, sometimes its 
worth trading some wake-up damage in return for getting in his face
again.  The other option is to block and find a gap to get close 
again.
Hwoarang can rip health off you with his high kicks, but they are
more long range, and Lei's close up game will kill him.  Played
sensibly Lei can tear right through even a good Hwoarang surprisingly
easily.  Keep in close, where he will be limited to his jabs.  The 
two to watch out for are the bolt cutter (b+2) or the home surgery 
(1,1,3,3).  The home surgery is kinda slow, but it hits mid from 
close range, which is something any Hwoarang player is aware of 
lacking, so be ready to block low quickly in it.  With the bolt 
cutter, it is a favourite from Hwoarang because it forces you back
enough to bring his legs into play.  The best thing to do is to 
use your drunken stance punch reversal, since the bolt cutter comes
a little slow with its auto sidestep, and you know he'll be looking 
to use it, it can be taken quite often.

Yoshimitsu
-----------

Yoshi, along with Hwoarang and Christie is one of the few people who
can play Lei at a custom string confusion game.  Unlike Hwoarang, who
simply needs to be rushed on and controlled, or Christie who needs to
be punished and controlled, Yoshi can play Lei's own exact game.
He can play a confusion game, he can play a game of his own without
reacting to you as such and he can play a close up or a long range
game.  Yoshi is very similar to Lei in many ways.  What he lacks and 
Lei has in spades is set-up games.  Lei can move into a position
where an opponent has to guess one way or another, Yoshi just doesn't
have that sort of capability to anything like the same degree.
Lying down is a serious mistake, the basic Yoshi slash (d/b+3) will 
hit you out of that, not to mention the humiliation of being pogo
sticked on the floor.  A pogoing Yoshi can be a problem for Lei,
since lots of his kicks hit low.  Never throw out a long range
rolling kick or stay on the floor for periods of time because you'll
get slashed up.  If he likes to pogo a lot then wait for it and pop
him in the face.  If he waits for you to drop and then pogos, just 
don't drop.  
A serious part of any Yoshi game is his unblockables.  Many Yoshi
players at mid range will immediatly start thinking about one or 
another unblockable, if you're playing this sort of Yoshi your best
bet is to get the move started and then dash back out as it 
triggers before popping back in and popping him in the face or 
throwing out one of Lei's many long range attacks.  At very long 
range dashing away from Yoshi's long range unblockables is certainly
the best tactic.
Happily for those who have to fight him Yoshi's side kick has been
cut down some, but his basic punch remains one of the best in the
game.  Many Yoshi players will base strings around his basic punch.
Happily, you have your punch parry.  Yoshi will look to keep you 
blocking by throwing out repeated basic punches, if he starts into
this throw out the drunken stance and make him wary of using the 
move.
Essentially you both want roughly the same thing in the match, to
keep the opponent blocking.  You want Yoshi blocking so that you can
take space to set up your mid/low guessing games.  He wants to keep
you blocking to slash you up with his sword some.  Sadly, as a rule
his moves have higher priority than yours, which means he can 
interrupt a lot of your offence.  Your best bet is to stick to your
wickedly fast attacks, with the snake punches and one two punches 
being great new attacks in this area.  Once you get him blocking set 
up your guessing games quickly and take advantage of any missed piece 
of guessing from Yoshi.  Yoshi's game plan is so close to Lei's as to
make the fight a hard one, a good Yoshi player will have a solid all
round game, he has odd juggle starters just like you and mix-ups of a
different sort, but just as much.  Keep in his face and don't give
him breathing room, play just the way that you'd hate someone to play
on you and you can often frustrate him as much as he will you, but 
your guessing game attacks come out faster than his unblockables, so 
you can take this one if your juggles are solid and you know your 
options.

Ling Xiaoyu
------------

A good Ling player is, essentially, an irritating Ling player.  
Happily you counteract a certain amount of that automatically.  
Generally Lei has great tracking so her wicked sidestepping play
is going to be cut down a lot.  One thing you can't afford to use
much in this match is the rush.  It doesn't track and it won't hit 
her in art of pheonix stance since a good Ling player will spend a 
lot of time in or going into Pheonix you really want to stay of the
rush, which is a big loss, but you can take it.  
Worst of all Ling is so short that lots of high attacks will 
automatically wiff her.  Its really not worth the risk, so stick to 
mid and low attacks.  Clearly not using the Rush and not using high
attacks is going to make this an unnatural and akward fight, but not 
impossible.  Panther and Tiger stance become even more useful than
normal with Ling, especially the Panther stance with Low Parry on her
art of pheonix.
Ling will generally want to fight in close, pecking away at you with 
little attacks and interrupting all your big moves.  Your best tactic 
is to neutralise both her sidestep game and her close up wall of 
pokes by finding some space and slapping her with Lei's many good 
ranged moves.  One thing to remember is that Ling is not really a 
popular choice, in the end she's a little girl, she doesn't look cool
and she doesn't do much damage.  This means that if your opponent 
does choose her he or she probably knows what they're doing.  With
this in mind, stick to your mid and low attacks, stay away from lying 
down, it can be done, but shouldn't be abused, avoid high attacks and 
rushing attacks, be aware you must master the Rave Sweep against 
Ling.  
In the end Ling causes very little damage, she relies very often on 
your forgetting her qualities and falling for her tricks.  If you
just remember who it is you're up against, stay out and use your 
range or employ your sweep there really isn't a great deal that
Ling can do against you.

Craig Marduk
-------------

Frankly, I've been rather dissapointed with the big man since I've 
seen him.  My tactics here might be a little weak since I've never
even been tackled successfully.  As far as I can tell staying up in
his face, despite his throwing game, and busting him in the head
when ever he even looks like going for a tackle stance yeilds pretty
good results.
I honestly can't offer good advice on Craig since I've never come 
across a good Craig player, he seems a little weak, but I doubt
very much that he really is.  I suspect though that simply staying 
with him and switching up ranges, preferably avoiding positions you
can be thrown from will prove a fairly solid tactic for him.

Kazuya Mishima
---------------

Ahh, the deadly Mishima Zaibatsu.  The odds for anyone who's a 
betting man are that either this guy or Jin are going to turn out to 
have won Tekken 4 when we all get to Tekken 5, and he's got the tools 
to do it.  First thing to avoid with Kazuya is his gut stun punches.  
He has quite a range of punches that will leave you crumpling to the 
floor painfully slowly, giving him a chance to land a godfist 
juggle, since they land from a crumple stun these will be a lot 
stronger than normal juggles.  Kazuya's gut punches land mid and 
don't have to land on counter to get crumple stun and they're what 
most good Kazuya players will be wanting to land on you because they 
cause wicked chunks of damage.  This means you won't want to be 
ducking too much, but of course, ducking is the only way to protect 
yourself from Kazuya's powerful Hell Sweeps.  A good Kazuya attack 
pattern, apart from the obvious wave dashing and god fist attacks 
will revolve quite strongly around these two options.  Apart from 
those Kazuya has good poking abilities, many of his pokes cause 
crumple stun on counter attack allowing him to punish you badly for a 
mistake in your poking strings.  Your best plan is to stay out from 
Kazuya, watch his dashing attacks and keep up a strong long ranged 
pressure game.  Don't stay in animal stances too much since he will 
be looking to get in your face as much as he can.  Dropping to the 
floor is a good tactic since there isn't a great deal that Kaz can do 
to stop you.  The hell sweeps will often wiff you if you stay down, 
and they can gift you a kangeroo kick juggle.  Don't take your time 
down there, but don't be afraid to drop, it can pay off well.
Also don't be afraid to go for some punch reversals, most of Kazuya's 
attacks revolve around his punching game so learning his punch 
patterns and shutting it out with drunken reversals can pay off 
extremely well.  Crouch dashing can be shut down with simple ducking
jabs, they're about the only things fast enough to catch the crouch 
dash on reaction.  If you start to learn his patterns you can shut 
down the crouch dash before you have to guess between punches and 
sweeps.  If you do have to guess then you're really going to have to 
go on intuition, but you don't want it to get to that.
Essentially to beat Kazuya you need to hold at mid to long range and
don't let him crowd you, play your own game.

Paul Pheonix
-------------

Okay, kiss your drop down game goodbye.  Paul has one of the nastiest 
set of moves for sitting your ass down if you drop so you'll have to 
win this one standing.  Paul will often be happy to let you control
the pace and punish your mistakes.  If this is so, play a clever 
game, its the position you'd prefer to be in, concentrate and you 
can teach him a lesson.  Other Paul players will go for a very fast,
linear game, a deathfist to shoulder barge to hammerfist can kill you 
before you even start, if this is so, use your movement, sidesteps, 
dodges and parrys to slow the action down some.
Paul's main weakness is basically Lei's, that he has heavy recovery 
times for wiffed and blocked moves, but he can punish you with a 
deathfist or hop kick rather worse than you can punish him, so stick 
to your string and poking game.  Remember that a good Paul player
will whip out a Deathfist at any slight chance of a connection, and
it is the greatest punishment move in Tekken.  Good Paul players will 
reverse, so buffer chickens on your more obvious moves and try to 
break off the Razor Rush into a stance change.
His hop kick will bust you out of a throw, and his throw range is 
better than yours too so you can kiss that goodbye as well.  He can't 
match you for variety of moves though or constant pressure so keep it 
up, don't stop, don't drop down and try to keep your stances and 
attacks flowing.  Paul is a big test for Lei since he rules out most 
of his options, his dropping throwing or power moves, but he can be 
beaten if your juggle and pressuring skills are up to par.  Fight 
aggresively on him and keep him from using his big guns.  
One of those guns is the Deathfist.  You can use the Drunken stance 
to parry it and then hopkick him for a juggle, or the one time you 
can safely drop down on a Paul player is when you see that Deathfist 
swinging in.  Straight drop to the floor, kangeroo kick and chuckle 
to yourself and him as you juggle his big blonde ass.  You can also 
drop out from his hop kick sometimes, but not too often.  Once again, 
certainly don't try the dropping waiting game, you'll just be battered.  
Most Paul players will know that their Deathfist can outrange a 
backdash and that you can't block while backdashing and they'll be 
looking for it.  Your back turning step though with the Ha Ha step 
option will bring you just out of range, sometimes just the back turn 
will do the trick.  When this happens and you make Paul wiff you can 
punish him in brutal fashion.
Another big Paul trademark move is the falling leaf.  This move 
has been progresively weakened through the Tekkens, but with its
new precision timing version its gotten back a lot of power with
not only guard stun but a follow up.  The best thing to do with
the leaf is watch for it.  Try to look at Paul's right hip and 
that side of his body, since this is where his falling leaf and
deathfist come out.  With a little experience you'll find you can
call a falling leaf every time it comes out, just by watching that
hip whenever you think it might come out and concentrating, 
Paul's moves do tell in his body if you know what to look for and
when you do he can be reliably blocked to a greater or lesser
degree.
One other famous Paul strength is his mix-up game.  His hammer fist
to Deathfist or Falling leaf will catch most newcomers every time
as will his sway back to low kick, elbow, low punch or mid punch,
straight elbow to low or mid punch or even his shredder to low, 
mid or high kicks.  The best advice for these, if you can't 
learn to predict by watching Paul's body as suggested above, 
is to get in and interrupt the sway back as soon as possible or 
snatch his hammer punch whenever you get a chance.  Failing that, 
try to block mid as a rule.  As if his mix up weren't good enough, 
Paul has a new one for Tekken 4, the Flash Elbow into gut buster, 
dragon claw or stone breaker.  Now, I've not seen this a lot so
far, but stone breaker hits low and juggles while the gut buster 
hits mid while the flash elbow is fast and can't be reversed.
So far I haven't seen this enough to find a way to counteract
it, but I think its safe to say that the best way will be as with
the other Paul mix-ups, watch him and predict him.
Paul's greatest weakness against a Lei game is his tracking.  Paul's
tracking is amongst the worst in the game, as such sidestepping often
can cause him greater problems than anyone else.  Since Lei is one
of the stronger sidestepping characters out there, the solution
to a Paul problem is fairly obvious, sidestep and attack.  Also,
Paul has his reversal, but you have one too.  Now, reversing Paul
can be dangerous since he has elbows and shoulders enough to
stuff reversals if he wants to, but he is one of the punchier
characters in the game and so should be tagged occasionally with
your reversal.  He has a new elbow in this Tekken, along with
two other elbows and a shoulder from short range Paul can be hard
to reverse, but persist with it on his Deathfists, shut them out
and his game will suffer severely.
Paul has more guard stuns in this Tekken, so he can play that game, 
nothing like you, but don't be pushed into constant blocking.  
Don't let him hammer punch you about, because he can use this to 
punish stance changing, but pressure him and keep it out, don't get 
frustrated when you lose all your stances to blocking his mindless 
Deathfisting, remember that you are style and he is not, all will be 
good.  Keep pressure on Paul and don't be afraid to use your 
sidesteps and various movement tricks, possibly even sidestep to 
stance change, since he can have problems with it despite the power
of the hammerfist.  The key to beating Paul is constant, safe, 
pressure.

Steve Fox
----------

Steve Fox can be a serious threat, but he does have huge problems 
against Lei.  First of all, he has practically no wake-up game to
speak of, meaning that your lying down game can go practically 
unchallenged.  Secondly, he has only punches, and you have an
unreversable punch parry with a long catch window.  What this means
is that in some of Steve's punch rushes you can throw out reversals
without even timing them since the longer window will mean that even
if you miss one punch you can catch a later one.  That said don't 
forget that Lei's reversal takes a long time, as reversal's go, to
activate, so you should make sure you get it out.  Thirdly, Steve has 
terrible movement during his attacks.  Because he is a puncher when 
he attacks his feet don't really move, he can sway back and to the 
side, but other than his reach, good though it is, he doesn't move
forward much, this has two effects.  One, the drunken reversal, which 
auto-rears back after its reversal period will take you out of danger 
range if it misses.  Two, Lei, who can move back and forth in his 
rushes, his kicks, his punches, in fact in almost all his attacks, 
has a huge movement advantage over Steve while attacking, over his
amazing none attacking movement.
Now, a good Steve player will usually stick and move in a genuinely
boxing style, clinching in close and using the sway and lean.  To 
beat Steve use your low attacks, your dropping attacks and your 
huge movement advantage, Lei is a very hard match for Steve 
tactically to be honest and if you just play to your strengths you 
can really punish him.

Christie Montaro
-----------------

Right, for those who don't know, Christie is a faster version of
Eddy Gordo, Capoaria.  For those who don't know even that this is
the weapon of choice for the inveterate button basher.  First of 
all, how to beat the basher.  Stick to punch rushes and Rave Sweeps
they will be painfully repetative so just concentrate and don't fall
for anything.  One of the problems with the masher is that he'll cut 
you right down on what you can do.  You can beat him/her easily, just 
not usually with any real style.
For the less experienced of you the hard thing about Christie is that
she has lots of long range kick strings that generally strike low
and mid, making her hard to block.  Assuming your opponent is 
actually good you'll either face a full Christie arsenal, seeing 
every single move coming out in every round, or you'll see a very
cut down arsenal based around her swinging jabs, knees and quick
short range mid kicks.  Either way a Christie player will want
to control both the range and the tempo of the fight, she will almost
never let you control it.  Which means you have to take that control.
First of all Christie likes to fight at fairly long range.  
Although her moves when coming out are wickedly fast and hard
to interrupt a lot of them do suffer from some wind-up and shocking
recovery times.  Often on recovery she visibly has to take a couple 
of steps to get back into the rythm of her jinga stance.  Although
most of her big moves cause huge guard stun you can usually still
pick her up because of the sometimes massive recovery times, and
if she wiffs a big move you can and should slaughter her.  All 
this means that you should keep pretty much right up in Christie's
face, punk her long wind-up moves and punish her slow recovery.
The move you're going to have to handle most of all is the Capoaria 
knee, known as the ghetto blaster (b+3).  It has vicious speed and
priority, but worst of all it will push you back into her favourite 
range for you and her kick strings.  The best way to work the Blaster
over is to dash in and out of range to make it wiff and punish with
the Drunken Fist or the Cannonball headbutt.  Of course, you can play
at long range as well, but Christie is just a touch better at it than 
Lei.  If your opponent is on minimum play with the Blaster and a few 
kicks and jabs you're going to have a hard game.  Try to tempt wiffed
blasters and play a little of your own throwing and guessing games.
If the opponent is playing Christie's full arsenal then you're going
to once again have a hard game.  A good Christie player can throw out
constant attacks every round and never repeat a move twice, much like
Lei.  This can be frustrating and leave you wondering what you can do
back.  In this situation the most important thing is to stay calm and
keep thinking.  With concentration her strings can be blocked, and 
her gaps after moves are, again, big enough to punish.
On her stances, she will rarely stay in Relax for long and Lei 
doesn't have a good punisher for it, so back off from a Relaxed
Christie and wait a second.  If she drops to lie down position
rush up and punish her.  Its rare that this will happen with a good
player, but watch her knees and shoulders, if her legs go flat and
her head goes back the opponent has left it too long and relax has
gone to lay down and the moves have been lost.  In this case you can
usually attack safely.  In handstand Lei's rolling kicks work 
wonderfully on Christie, she will be expecting you to run in and 
waiting to lash out, once she sees you coming low the Christmas 
Stealer combo will normally be triggered, but it will come out too
late.
A good Christie player is one of the hardest matches you can find,
especially for Lei since he prefers to play in her range.  Stay in her 
face, don't let her get into a stride.  If she's playing a short game 
she can be hard to beat, the worst, or rather best, Christie
player will switch between very few moves and all of them.  In this
case the best advice is to either play amazingly or know when you're
outclassed.

King
-----

King's tricks are getting more and more well known, but he is still
a deadly opponent in the right hands.  But then, so is Lei.  First of 
all, do not go to the ground, King's wake up game is probably the 
best in the game.  He has ground throws, and if you wiff rolling 
kicks or drop beside him he will break you, his ali kicks will screw 
you up too since he can mix up three kicks or single kick uppercut.  
For King you need to stay on your feet.  If you get knocked down your
best bet is probably standing straight up and preparing to break a 
throw.  If you roll you'll get Ali Kicked to hell, if you stay down 
you'll get ground thrown.  If you stand and duck you'll catch a hop
kick to the face, so stand and get ready to break, its really the
only option with King's great ground game.
King does tend towards the straight forward in his attacks though and 
Lei's amazing lateral movement can cut him up.  King does have a 
great poking game, but lacks the mix ups to make straight forward 
striking attacks with it.  What he will be looking for is forcing you 
into blocking with his amazingly fast strings of pokes, then catching 
you with one of his deadly throws.  Your job is to move around and 
away from his pokes or reverse them rather than block them.  Moving 
laterally is a good idea since Kings pokes all tend to rush him 
forward in a line.  
Another point to remember is that very few of Kings poke strings 
include kicks, so the drunken stance reversal is a very good option.
King will also use those punches in order to push you back to
the perfect range for his hop kick in the hope he'll catch you 
rushing back in to attack you.  Simply don't fall for this, if he 
pushes you back either don't rush in, or come in with a sidestepping
attack.  Your best bet though is to back off a little more and come
in with one of your good range attacks.
Don't do too much stance switching from the Punch rush since he can
hop kick you out of it, gifting him a juggle if his reactions are
quick enough.  You're better off following through with the whole
rush and the low kick, many King players will know you can end with
a mid kick there and will be looking for the reversal from hope 
alone, use the low kick to stuff them over.  In fact, tricking King
into a kick reversal on a punch is a good trick and should be used
often.
Don't be predictable with your kicks, the Rave Spin, for instance, is 
right out, any King will reverse kicks he knows are coming and he 
can't be chickened.  This doesn't count out kicks totally, especially
for Lei who has so many low kicks, but watch slow or predictable high
or mid hitting kicks since King players just love to catch them.
One thing to watch out for is King's new Inseguri kick.  Basically 
this nasty little move is like Lee's old mist trap kick only easier 
to get off, if it strikes, you take damage, of course but if you 
block it catches you with a sort of throw.  The only real answer to 
this is its just another reason to stay at long range from King.  If 
someone keeps getting up to you and abusing this move I suggest 
poking him with snake punches and low jabs, or sidestepping.
As a rule, stay at mid to long range with King, you have better range 
than him by a long way and he wants to get up close with you.  Use 
your better movement, keep ranging back and forth, in and out and 
King, who is almost always a pitbull of an attacker, will tend to
have major problems with you.

Marshall Law
-------------

Or Jackie Chan verses Bruce Lee.  Lei can actually take Law's game 
apart in some instances, dropping under the Junkyard combo and the 
Dragon storm with your straight drop to the floor can be very 
effective, especially since most Law players love to use these to 
control the pace of the match.  When you drop under him be sure to 
Kangeroo kick to juggle him.  You can parry the middle blow of the 
Junkyard instead which can leave Law open for an uppercut juggle.  
If he misses a flip kick you have a certain hopkick juggle.  Watch 
out for the dragon tail sweep, when you block it hit him with a 
rising attack.  His wake up-game isn't great, if you stay down the 
Dragon tail will sail over you so you only have to fear the frogman 
in your lay down game.  Don't let Law control you and he will go down.  
Law will want to control the pace of the match, and keep it
fast, with his junkyard combo and dragon storm, but you can take 
these speed controllers right away from him with a little work
and make him play to your speed.
Lots of people are afraid to lay down on Law (As it were), but there 
is no need to be.  Examine it, the Dragon Tail will wiff clean over 
you and open up damage chances, the Law slide will take too long as 
will rushing up and low kicking, as will the Frogman attack, there 
is no reason not to drop on Law.
A big problem with Law is his punch reversal, not only will the 
punch reversal kill you dead in the water if you punch rush too
much, or just plain punch a lot.  What's more, if he wiffs it his
new moves from the taunt makes it a lot like Lei's Drunken Stance,
dangerous even if it misses.  His punch reversal can kill you with
juggles, throws and power moves its a serious contender.  Happily
none of this takes away his problems with a strong dropping game.
Dropping moves are all kicks anyway and his moves still need you
standing.  Simple fact is, you want to drop down a lot playing
Law, controlled kicking, dropping and low strikes can pull the
powerful fast Law game to pieces surprisingly effectively.
Law players will have their custom strings tattooed on their 
hearts so you need to work on that part of his game.  The best way 
to counter it is to sidestep, using your stance changes, dash out 
of range and use your greater range to attack him.  Law's game 
will revolve on constant attacks, while you as Lei will be looking 
to find a constant but somewhat calmer rythm of attack, a little 
space can do that for you.  Law's much vaunted wake-up game can 
have problems against someone who know what he's doing on the 
floor, and as Lei that should be your middle name.  You can control 
and frustrate Law, expecially since he will be expecting to control 
the pace and will be unused to having that taken away from him, 
which with your lying down and stronger ranged game is exactly what 
you should do.


Time released Characters:
-------------------------

Jin Kazama
-----------

Jin, along with Kazuya the boy voted most likely to win Tekken 4.
Forget everything you once knew about Jin from Tekken 3 or Tag-
Tekken, he is so different as to practically be a different 
character.  Wheras before Jin relied on height switching attacks
in the three ring circus, reversals and mishima juggles all of these
very major tools have been taken from him.  What he is now is a 
poking machine.  He has lots of attack strings including knees, which
you cannot reverse or parry and come out very fast, he has his 
movement centered in his crouch and wave dashing, and he has his 
power attacks in what used to be his godfists.  This makes a good
Jin a very powerful in close poker.
Your tactics here are fairly clear, first of all, take some space.
At range the only attack you have to be really wary of with Jin is 
the laser cannon/laser scraper coming in, or a crouch dash.  The 
laser series should walk right into a punch reversal to hop kick 
each and every time, the crouch dash you really want to pop with
a low punch, or if you can call it, reverse it instead.  Since
your backward and lateral movement both generally and while attacking
is much better than Jins you should be able to keep out his poke
range while keeping safe pressure on him.
The other tactic that works suprisingly well on Jin is dropping to
the floor.  He should really be able to pick you back up again
with his attacks, but in reality most Jin players will be so absorbed
in their poking strings that dropping down can take them totally by 
surprise.  A lot of the time dropping on Jin can be a very good 
tactic, especially since he has lots of three or four move canned 
combos that have no ground striking sets in them.  Dropping to the 
floor on the first or second strike of such combos can be very 
effective, expecially since very few other characters possess 
quite so many mid length, mid range sequences as Jin, he's a prime
target for dropping and kangeroo kick juggling.
Your punch rush can be a good move, but since it moves you from far
to close and Jin wants you in close, don't over use it, or at least
mix it up with stance changes.  Remember that Jin does rely on 
punches quite a lot and you have a punch reversal, so don't fear 
throwing it out.  He does advance on lots of his punch strings so a
missed reversal will leave you more vunerable than on, say, Steve, 
but using drunken attacks to slap down an advancing Jin on your 
failed reversal can work and will warn him who he's facing.
Jin will want to fight a stand up, toe to toe fight with you, don't
let him.  Your movement is better than his, as is your range and your
options, use them.

Lee Chaolan/Violet
-------------------

Lee's an old favourite of mine from Tekken 2 and I never understood 
why he got left out of Tekken 3.  Still, these things happen.
First thing about Lee is he has wickedly fast and powerful kicks with
great switch ups, and they are really what you're looking at here, 
his kicks.  His punches are fairly straight forward fast pokes, since
some of his kicks are faster than his punches you'll generally only 
see Lee's punches when he's buying himself some thinking time, take 
this as a signal to increase your pressure heavily.
On the kicks, Lee has long range and short, low, mid and high 
striking kicks, not to mention the infinity kicks, mist trap throw, 
shin to head kicks and hitman stance.  He will often poke using just 
his kicks, especially against Lei, who he knows has a punch reversal,
and they're quick enough to do it.  Lee will often seek to batter you 
into blocking with a series of machine gun kicks and kick pokes then 
knock you with one of his more special attacks.  A Lee favourite are
the shin kicks to head kicks, three low and one mid kick that many 
people have real trouble blocking.  Its obvious when its coming, Lee 
sort of stamps on your knee over and over, then pulls up, all I can 
advise is to watch it when it happens and never ever let it hit 
again, it always goes low low low mid so there's really no reason to 
have such a hard time blocking it.  The mist trap throw is a serious
threat against a good Lee player who will force you into blocking and 
then knock this out on you, knowing you'll block and eat some 
damage.  It is possible to spot and duck under this, watch for the 
first kick that he pulls back on and duck it, but it is fast and if 
he gets you into a blocking frame of mind can cause problems.  
The only real protection is to not get in that position, as I'll 
outline later.
With the infinity kicks, the best advice is to sidestep them when 
they start, since they track suprisingly poorly, or lateral walk 
around them if he starts at a distance.  Never, ever, ever get caught 
next to a wall with the infinity kicks, certainly not in a corner 
because they will kill you.  If you get knocked into a wall by them, 
or are in next to a wall when they start tech roll on the wall for 
your life because if you're in a corner with the infinity kicks 
swinging towards your face you're pretty much screwed.
Dropping down is risky with Lee since he has his slide attacks, but 
for a moment at close range it can be a rewarding trick.  He can slap 
you with the Silver cutter, the shin kicks, the sidestep cutter and 
the hitman cutter if you do it often, but once or twice and he'll be 
too busy looking for high or mid kick strings to catch it every time.
On hit man stance, never rush in on it, because he'll kill you.  If 
Lee just drops into it wait him out, he can't move in it so he'll have 
to stand there and wait for you.  Best advice here is to back off, 
switch into panther stance, then slink up to him.  At this point 
only the scatter punch will connect on you, which sort of means 
you're gambling on how well your opponent knows both Lee and Lei,
most the time he'll go for one of the other moves, all of which will
either wiff or be parried gifting a juggle.  The scatter punch 
though, is slower than the panther paw and if you know its coming, or 
on good reactions you can interrupt and juggle.  The only real 
problem is if Lee drops into Hitman as you perform another attacks, 
since he slides back and low he can avoid high attacks.  The answer 
to this is don't perform strings that end in high attacks.
Generally Lee's kick poking, slides and shredders can make him very 
hard to beat.  What you need to do first of all is control and, 
often, slow down, the pace of the fight.  Keep either to mid range or 
very long range, both of which you have significant advantages in and 
don't let him pressure you.  Punch rushing and panther or tiger 
stance switching can be very useful.  Don't let him panic you and 
don't let him pressure you.  Your movement is better than his, 
especially backward, so use it to create space and control the pace 
of the game.  If he's pressuring you, back flip away and into Crane, 
or drop down, or ha ha step away from him.

Bryan Fury
-----------

Bryan Fury, appropriatly for the plot line really, can be an 
amazingly hard match for Lei.  For that matter a good Bryan player
can be an amazingly hard match for anyone.  The main reason for this
against Lei is that Bryan has in abundance the one thing that Lei
really lacks, while standing attacks.
A crouching Bryan is deadly, if you block high he can catch you with 
the powerful Chains of Misery throw.  If you block low he can pop you
with his power uppercut for a huge juggle, or pick you up with the
fisherman hook slam for another different juggle.  If you try to 
attack he can hit you with his rising knee that has amazing priority
and can be chained.  This is bad for most players, since Bryan will 
tend to throw low punches and crouch down, then fight up out of the
crouch, but for Lei, who forces opponents into ducking and blocking
low with his mix ups, its even worse.  The exact position Lei forces
people into is where Bryan wants to be.  Lei likes to attack 
low and Byran likes to block low, but added to this Bryan has a 
juggle starting with a jump, the Orbital Heel, which can be used to 
jump over low attacks and juggle you up.  Overall, you want to stay
away from you low attacks with Bryan.
Bryan has a deadly punch reversal, great priority and great punch 
range.  Whenever you give him a window you can expect to see a 
mach punch winging your way.  On top of this his punch rushes can
be mixed up with low and mid strikes at the end, and are very quick
to chip away at your health.  Your own punch reversal can be 
seriously undermined since he has several elbow strike sets that will
humilate you for your attempt.  Bryan has a great throw range, with 
his punch range, and a very nasty sidestepping game that will punish
you for throwing out aimless attacks.  Added to all this, most Bryan 
players will be constantly looking for his snake edge attack so 
dropping to the floor will get you popped right back up, or worse,
see you eating his double knee juggle off the snake edge.  Finally 
his rolling dash, sway attack, step back punching attacks and forward
swinging kick sequences means he has movement, though more stripped 
down than Lei's, that can cause serious problems.  
What you're basically going to have to do here is stick with mid 
attacks to keep him on his feet, much the way that everyone else 
sticks to low ones to keep you on yours.  Definatly stagger any
punch rushes you might choose to bring out, or use them in juggles
or when Bryan doesn't have space to think.  Anything else and you 
will eat a punch reversal into a nasty stinging mach breaker.  Fury
will use low punches, get into a crouch, then make you guess on his
juggle, throw, or knee.  If he's in a crouch never duck with him, 
also never attack him, the knee can just pop you either way, or 
worse the rising upper.  If you stand though you only have to watch 
for the Chains of Misery, which is a lot better than him hitting a 
rising upper juggle, what's more is the Chains motion is a little 
tricky (FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2) and if you watch him carefully you can see
him flicker back a second with the first d/b and start crouching to 
avoid the attack quite effectively.  If you happen to be in Tiger 
Stance you can walk right up to Bryan since he'll almost always be 
obsessed with hitting a rising attack rather than another low one and 
unlike most knees in the game Bryan's rising knee can be reversed.
If Byran starts one of his punch rushes on you and you miss the 
chance to reverse him, normally only at the very start of the rush,
you should stay standing and block.  Painful as it is to eat that low
kick a few times its not as bad as eating the knock down elbow even 
once with its wake up follow ups.
Watch a back dashing Bryan since he can flip back in with his flying 
knee (b,b+4) and punish you for forward rushing pokes.  Also, never 
attack a taunting Bryan, its his equivilant to your Crane stance for
temping people into deadly attacks.
Other than keeping Bryan on his feet with mid attacks and keeping him 
from too many punch rushes with well placed pressure games you have 
one serious weapon against his game, Panther Stance.  If you come at 
a standing Bryan in Panther he can't punch down into a crouch since
you'll parry him, he can't plain crouch since you can pop him up with
the panther paw too quickly, and most of his rush starters strike 
high enough to sail over Panther stance.  Panther can often be abused 
on Bryan, since only one of his string starts will hit it, even the 
mach punch will go over Lei's head.
There's no easy way to take down a good Bryan player to be honest, 
good solid attack strings are a good idea, but even at the best it 
will be an exchange of damage sort of fight.  The only real upside is 
that your greater number of solid juggle starters and your powerful 
kicks can give you an advantage in such an exchange.  Use your switch 
ups, keep up a barrage of attacks and be aware of his tricks.

Nina Williams
--------------

Attack reversal, low parry, a nasty sidestep game and some of the 
best poking in Tekken make the blonde bitch a, well, bitch to beat.  
Watch her custom strings, its a popular Nina choice to set up 
strings with low kick to backhand chop, in this case try to duck 
the chop and sneak out a low attack, just a jab or rising kick.  
Don't try to block everything, especially with top Nina players because 
that's all you'll ever do, break her strings with little attacks, 
even just low jabs.  Also, the cannonball headbutt can yield good 
results on Nina's long high strings since it makes Lei rear back 
and avoid them.  Some of her strings include low kicks, if you know 
one is coming Lei's low parry, or these days the universal low parry, 
can really piss off a Nina player.  Watch her strings, be ready to 
break throws and plan your strikes.  Low punch her crouch dashes
and stay unpredictable.
Chicken any kicks or punches you think might get reversed, since
a good Nina player will throw in a few reversals in a match, 
consider Chicken Baiting, but old veteran Nina players will tend
not to stand for this.
It goes without saying that you have to cut down Nina's crouch 
dashes, ducking is a simple fix for it, if your opponent gets 
predictable there are plenty of fixes for this, but if not low
jabs are an acceptable way to break it out.  Anything to avoid
that multi-throw.  Try to learn the multi-throw breaks, but if
you really can't they're all one punch or both punches, so hammer
them in a shamless panic.  Nina has a wicked general throw game,
not to mention set ups.  Her attacks can mix up about as well
as Lei close in, which is why we want her kept out.
New attacks to watch for in Tekken 4 are her new double punches 
which have an insane set of set-ups, including the new mid-hitting
spider knee that juggles, so learn how your opponent leads from
this and work around it.  The knee is so good it will come out a 
lot, so you might want to just block if she uses is that close up.
She can delay some moves she couldn't before.  Mainly her new moves
make her even more deadly close up, don't play that game with her.
Don't lie down, Nina has attacks to stand up back up, and she can
make you eat a whole mess of Divine Cannon juggles which will pick 
you up right off the ground.  You can lie down once or twice with 
some people, but don't even try it once with Nina.  Your best plan 
with Nina is to look for space, the further away you are the more
the advantage swings to Lei.  Her longer reaching moves like the 
Blonde Bomb have considerable recovery time, if you block the bomb 
you have a guaranteed hop kick into juggle.  One other probem with 
Nina is she can even shut down your rushing game, her reversals 
combined with the fact that she can mid-kick you out of stance 
changes rather than having to rely on low punches can be very 
irritating.  Don't stance change from punch rushes except in juggle
mix-ups, instead break off and totally change tack.  Use the Rave 
Sweep and lure her into your Lei traps.  Don't be predictable in 
anything, especially with either your staggering of the rush or 
your kick endings.  As a rule keep your distance, don't let her 
drag you into a poking or throwing war, punish her wiffs and blocked 
slow moves and you can take this one.

Julia Chang
------------

I hate the Changs, always have, always will, hate hate hate them.
Main reason for this is that they have two very nasty little attack
sets, the low to low/mid/high attacks, such as the low spin kick to
low kick/elbow/high kick and the damn son of bow and arrow kicks, 
which hit low with huge range and make their follow up mid attacks 
certain.  On dealing with these, for the first attack, block low then
mid, eat the low kick, its better than taking the elbow to knock 
down.  There really is no better answer than that, once you block and
punish the mid attacks a few times she'll start to stick with the low
kicks, which is when you can throw out a low parry and really punish
her scrubby ways.  The bow and arrow kick you simply have to watch 
for.  It sounds obvious, but watch her, you're never safe from the 
bow and arrow kicks unless you're at really long range, and since she 
swings back it will avoid any attack you happen to throw out.  The 
only thing to do then is to never throw out aimless attacks and 
always be ready to block low, then mid, always low then mid.  If you 
block the low hit on the bow and arrow the mid one is easy and has 
huge recovery time, on blocking it I would suggest a dragon falls 
throw into slide into kick, its a very good option here.
Other than this cheapness Julia is a suprisingly good character, she 
has powerful rushing pokes that can push an opponent back quickly and 
punish them on the walls.  Even though a lot of her strings use 
punches don't try to reverse them because a lot of them also use 
elbows, and unless you know Julia better than she knows herself you 
almost certainly aren't going to be able to make that judgement.  She 
has powerful and fast attacks and can mess you up badly with pressure 
and range switching attacks.
What you do have over her though is that most of Julia's moves a 
quite linear, with some punch rushing to sidesteps, or straight 
sidesteps into stance changes you can do her some serious mischief.  
Don't try backing off since she'll just nab you with twin arrows and 
bow and arrows to make your life a misery, instead come in close then 
sidestep around her use you lateral movement and more powerful 
attacks.  She has great forward movement, so running away is never a 
good idea, but her tracking isn't the best so you can use that.  You 
have to be careful in close since Julia has a solid poking and 
throwing game, but your sidestepping and switch ups can beat her with 
a little patience and concentration.
To compete Julia has to land whole strings to your one or two 
successful strikes, once you know that you can use it to your 
advantage, don't let her little attacks make you panic and keep in on 
her.  If you keep your head and stay close while avoiding her throws 
you can take this.  She wants to charge forward, getting close 
negates that, if you can stay in close and slow down the pace of the 
fight with parries and stances, then you'll know you have her.

Kuma
-----

Kuma should be feared against a human opponent, or rather, a 
particular sort of human opponent.  Watch what your opponent does 
when selecting his character, if they scan slowly across each face, 
looking them all over and then go back to Kuma, then you've got 
yourself an extremely easy fight.  If he goes straight to Kuma and 
picks him without another thought, then you're in trouble.
The reason for this is that Kuma is very hard to win with.  He's big 
and slow which means that anyone with a good interrupt game can take 
him apart, and on the floor he's in so much trouble its untrue.  
Everyone knows this, so if someone picks him with intent, he's 
probably a very good player.  If, however, someone scans over and 
picks him because he's a huge bear and so looks dangerous, then the 
Kuma's just a load of big fat hairy fight practice.
Really Kuma's one advantage is that he's so big that he's hard to 
juggle normally, so many of your juggles won't work, however, is 
disadvantages more than make up for this.
The biggest reason you can take Kuma to pieces is that most of his 
attacks are punches, and you have a punch reversal.  You can drunken 
stance reverse eighty percent of what Kuma does and he really can't 
stop you for the most part.  His biggest punch attack is the G-Clef, 
since his basic punches hit high and are slow as hell he won't use 
them because if the fact you'll duck and kill him, but the G-Clef 
gets so often used you can parry it almost every time.  He has very 
few good low attacks, so blocking him is fairly easy, the only reason 
to block low is that he has very good throw range and some good 
throws, but since you want to be at fairly long range most the time 
anyway this really won't be too much of a problem.  Kuma has poor 
range, so you can keep at range from him and just pick him off when 
you like.  You can punch rush uncontested since he has no moves fast 
enough to interrupt it, just don't bother staggering it, and he has 
no reversal or parry for it.  When Kuma hits the floor your solid 
wake-up game can take him apart.  For instance, the low punches from 
back turned will hit Kuma even if he stays down, in fact if you get 
Kuma on the floor and have your back turned you can often just do the 
low punches over and over and keep him there for the rest of the 
fight.
Don't rush into Kuma, since his hammers and lunges will punish you, 
but since you can sling into him with attacks there's really no 
earthly reason you'd want to rush up to him.
One time Kuma does have low attacks are from his crouch stance, here 
his mix up of rising hammer and low claw series can be dangerous.  
Best option is to duck, and if he goes for the hammer stand with him, 
if not block the low hits, then parry the slow mid hits before he can 
mix up again.  His only other low attack is the salmon hunter which 
is powerful, but slow as hell and if you don't block it you deserve 
to lose.
One point to watch out for is the hunting bear stance, at this point 
Kuma does have dangerous low attacks, powerful mid attacks and a 
decent throw.  However he can't block, your best bet here is to 
attack immediatly, the rolling kicks are a good bet since he can't 
back dash and they have huge range, also he can't avoid or block low 
attacks in this stance.  If you don't have this chance don't fall for 
it and block low, the low attacks in hunting bear cause very little 
damage and in it he loses his throw range so the real danger is 
ducking and getting hit with the bear fling.
You can stay at range from Kuma, rush in, pummel him up close, then 
back off again and do it all over again, and he really can't stop 
you.

Heihachi
---------

Heihachi Mishima can be a real pain to beat.  As a rule a good Hei 
player will be a turtle, he'll block up and then pop you out with one 
of his many powerful fast punching attacks.  He can wave dash and his 
hell sweeps mix up can kill you dead, as with his wind god fist, his 
godfist, hammer punch, demon's breath and his deadly thunder god fist 
are all tools you have to watch out for.
He will kill your lying down game, between the hammer punch, demon 
uppercut and the geta stomp you really don't want to drop to the 
floor much, the hammer will whack you down, the demon punch will pick 
you up and the geta stomp will press you if you stay there.  Don't 
drop with Heihachi.  Also, his hammer punch can slam you out of your 
punch rushes.  A good Heihachi player will rely heavily on the hammer 
punch against you, sometimes turtling and using it almost exclusively 
since it hits you out of so many moves.  Your best bet is to make him 
fear throwing it out carelessly with the occasional Tiger or Drunken 
parry on it and when you do parry it to punish it severly.
He has lots of uppercuts that run in low and come up mid, such as the 
usual mishima crouch dash attacks but also the demon uppercut, the 
godfist and the twin pistons so you should be wary about throwing out 
high attacks because he'll slip under and hammer you up in the air 
for a powerful juggle.
Your best tool here is sidestep and sidestep to snake stance, always 
go to Heihachi's right.  For some reason sidestepping to Heihachi's 
right is always the best plan with him.  If he throws out a god fist 
then you can whip around him and punish him severely.  What Heihachi 
will want to do is push you back with his punches, then slap you as 
you move in to attack.  Most of his uppercuts have heavy push back on 
them, and you want to stay as in close as you can to him so you're 
best served sidestepping or reversing those punches rather than 
blocking them or you'll never get in striking range.  Heihachi 
players love the twin pistons, if he goes for them a lot, sidestep 
left then even if the first one strikes the second will wiff for a 
free side throw.  Sidestepping, along with reversing are good, but 
risky ways to punish an attacking Heihachi, simply low jabbing him 
out the crouch dash is another good way to keep him down and pressure 
him.
On a pure turtle you should just move in and take advantage.  
Remember you have several moves where the opponent must guess between 
two very dangerous options where to block, teach Heihachi that 
blocking Lei is a big mistake with them.
Careful sidestepping and dangerous mix ups can take Heihachi down, 
deadly though he can be, keep your head and don't let him place you 
with his push backs and interrupts, pressure him and use your 
advantages.

Combot
-------

Combot is this games mokujin, he simply emulates the other characters 
in the game.  Your only real headache is in working out who he is 
before he starts to smack you about.  Unfortunately unlike mokujin 
his strange body makes it a lot harder to pick out exactly who he's 
being from his stance.  He doesn't change every round though as far 
as I've seen, so you can call on the walk in.  I don't have all the 
walk ins down well enough yet to describe them officially, but I'll 
be working on it.

Costume:

Any punch, a blue flowing chinese style shirt worn open to show
Lei's torso.  Black pants and shoes.

Any kick, blue jeans, a brown leather pilot's jacket, sneakers
and Lei's old blue fingerless gloves.

Opening Stances:

Lei clenches his hands together and then opens them out, palms
up and say's 'Come on'

Lei folds his arms in his old Tekken 3/Tag walk-in then says
'Let's go'

Win Stances:

Hold - 1:  Lei does his rearing wobbling drunken stance

Note that all the other Chinese/Japenese characters talk in
Chinese or Japenese, only Lei talks in English.  Though 
personally I love it, the accent is so thick it just sounds
cool, just like Jackie Chan.

Other wins:

I've seen these, but can't get them to trigger at will
from holding buttons, any ideas how they can be controlled?

Five animal stances, Lei does his old all five animal stance
switches.

Single stance, Lei raises his right hand and holds his left
along his straight left leg, his back right one bent in a 
semi pheonix stance, from the earlier Tekkens.

Plot:

This is far as I can tell from bits and pieces the plot of
Lei in Tekken.  Bits I've assumed or worked out but not
explicitly stated anywhere official are in pointed brackets 
<>.

Lei is investigating international crime and drug dealing.
Too many paths lead to the Mishima Zaibatsu for it to be
coincidence, not only to the Zaibatsu, but to Bruce Irvin, 
leader of the Mishima Zaibatsu's personal army.  To stop Lei 
from investigating the corporation Kazuya enters Bruce
into the King of Iron fist tournament, with the intent
of destroying Lei and cutting his investigation short.
Lei enters the tournament to get to Bruce, and takes him
down, but Bruce breaks and runs before he can question him,
escaping onto a jet.  Bruce's plane crashes in suspicious 
circumstances and his body goes missing.
Version one <Because ogre has taken his body from the crash and 
absorbed his soul.>
Version two <Because Dr. Able has stolen his body to take out the
brain and store it for later use, since totally loyal highly
trained people are hard to get a hold of.>
- Neither version is one hundred percent, since Ogre's having
Bruce's moves does not mean he has absorbed him, he has Anna
William's moves too and she's alive in Tekken 3.  I think
Version two is the most convincing story.  At least, given
that Tekken has fighting robots, demons and such like it's
the most convincing.  Anyway, he goes missing.
Lei believes that Bruce's plane was blown up by the Mishima
Zaibatsu to silence him after his failure to defeat Lei.  
For the next eighteen years Lei's career is amazing, he solves 
international crimes with ease, stars in commercials and films, even 
time seems unable to touch him, at forty five he looks half his age, 
nothing seems to go wrong for the 'Supercop'.  One black cloud is
on his horizon as his <rival?> partner and friend Bryan Fury
is gunned down in a fire fight during a drugs investigation,
but what really attracts Lei's attention is the fact that
Bryan's body is never recovered.  Prominent martial artists 
start going missing, thanks to the re-apperance of ogre, 
their bodys never being found.  Lei remembers back to the 
only other unsolved case of his career, Bruce Irvin.  Lei 
asks to be attached to the case of the missing martial 
artists.  No leads come up until Heihachi visits Lei 
personally, asking him to compete in King of the Iron Fist 
tournament three.  Lei sees that his only option to return 
to his investigation of the Zaibatsu and get a lead on the
disapearance<s> of <both Bruce and> Bryan <or to make up for
his earlier failure with Bruce Irvin> is to enter the 
tournament.  Curiosity and duty drive him into the 
tournament.
Lei enters the tournament, more interested in investigation
than combat he talks to the other competitors, King, Armor
King, Jin, Ling, all have the same story of dissapearing friends, 
however none of them, or any other the interviewies have the same 
details of Bruce's or Bryan's disapearances.  Lei quickly makes a 
connection between the other disapperances and the strange force that
everyone's talking about Heihachi's efforts to capture.
Which still doesn't explain <Bruce and> Byran, until Lei's
first match.  Lei sees his former friend, but with the 
fighting style of his former enemy <who's brain he has>. 
Aided by his cybernetically enhanced strength
and Lei's shock at his appearance Bryan beats Lei, or at
least batters him back long enough to escape from the control of Dr. 
Abel and the Mishima Zaibatsu forces.  Lei, concerned with
wrapping up the case of Ogre and the disaperances lets
Bryan go, maybe he owes his former partner for letting him
down, maybe he just knows they'll meet again.  Lei wraps
up the case of the disapearances and goes back to his
normal life.
His life becomes consumed by his work, his live in lover
leaves him because of it and he fails in an operation to
capture an agent of a major crime syndicate <Bryan Fury>.
Rival detectives jealous of Lei's amazing success reported
his failure to Lei's superiors as being due to his allowing
personal affairs to affect his job peformance. Thanks to this 
Lei is suspended for one month.
During his suspension Lei learns that the Synidicate he 
had failed to take down was planning to assasinate a boxer
entered into the King of the Ironfist Tournament 4, Steve
Fox.  Lei enters the tournament to gain information from
Steve, capture his would be assassin and bring down the
syndicate, redeeming his honour.
After all, he has nothing else to do for a month.

13) Summary
============

I hope this guide has been easy to follow, if not mail me questions
and concerns and I'll fix things up, I also hope its been correct,
if anyone disagrees with my opinions or my facts, let me know, I'd 
love to update this.  I hope this is a solid guide to playing Lei, 
a basis for further growth and tactics.  If you're a beginner I
suggest starting with general tactics and moves and working out from
there one stance at a time.  Treat the whole thing as a learning 
experience, every bout, every FAQ, every failed match, every 
successful one.

If you're already a high level Lei player reading this I hope at 
least some of this has been interesting if not useful.

14) CREDITS   
============

This FAQ format is based on Abrar's Kuma FAQ, I basically deleated 
out all the info and filled it back in again, so I should thank 
him for that, nice format:
Abrar (e-mail- abrarz@yahoo.com)
INSIDE TEKKEN - http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Bridge/2700  

Catlord, who's movelist is clearly invaluable, and a little bit of 
that old Tekken psychology FAQ he wrote probably crept in on my
own words about trash talking.  Although he has made some mistakes
on his movelist.

I've read and probably taken on board a certain amount from the 
various Lei FAQ's out there so these are all the ones that I've 
read:

A few people have been good enough to mail me with comments on my FAQ, 
and I thank them all.  ConfuciusQ, Arief, Ave and Eric Janson.

Also the unauthorized tekken 3 fighting guide by Ben Cureton has 
been my bible for so long that I can no longer tell what's mine 
and what's from that any more really.  As such I should probably 
list all the Lei guys from that as well:

Marty '1TruKing' Hector, Jeff 'Chinaman' Hsu and 
Matthew 'Lei-UK' Gosling.

On top of that, my best friend Steve Kearns for getting constantly 
battered by me from Tekken Two to Tag Tekken and beyond, and who's 
Jun cheapness has trained me well along with his irritating Lying 
Lei play.

My friend Pete, who is Heihachi, against whom a year of constant 
Paul/Lei versus matches in Tekken Two gave me a strong base and 
allowed me to pick out a Paul chain from a mile away.

And Namco, who own me.
