Okay this FAQ is NOT for beginners. Furthermore, if you are looking
for movelist, strategies, or combos just close this because you won't
find any of those here. This is an Anti-FAQ for Christie. This means
that different player would give you their views about how to beat
other characters with Christie. This FAQ will discuss other character's
weaknessess and how to exploit them with Christie. However, this FAQ
won't discuss anything that will exploit Christie because it would
just... hummm... will I just don't want to. lol :p Oh a few more
thing, the legends or command will be used like the common ones that
you find in tekken zaibatsu site or anyother FAQ. We are assuming that
you knows your in and out of tekken which you should know all the keys
and legends that we use. Also, if you need a movelist or whatever,
just go to tekken zaibatsu or any other site.

about me:  Well just started playing t4 and I thought of writing a FAQ.
           I didn't want to write a regular FAQ that is for beginners
           and I wanted something indepth. Sooo.. I came up with this.
           I like Christie because of how good she is now. Such as her
           juggles, mixups, and pokes. Also, not to mention that she
           is like the hotest chick in Tekken. (Here we go! *Kiss*)

Here goes the Anti-Sections. Right now, the characters are not in any
specific order. However, I will put the name of the person who wrote
it on top to give credit. Also, there isn't too much right this
moment, but as time progress, I will update this frequently.

-------------------
Steve is fast. Extra fast. However, Christie can be a pain in the ass
for Steve. There are a few moves that you really need to look out with
Steve that I must mention.

1) d/f+1+2 - This is a fast down punch and a power uppercut that stuns
and knock down. This move is extremely fast and has unbelievable
advantage even if is block because there is a guard stun animation. Be
on a look out that Steve players will abuse a lot of this move. He can
put if on you if you whiff a move, has slow recovery, or just counter
you. Either way, is deadly. Furthermore, after it, he can start some
okizeme with his d/b+2. Also a reminder that this move can hit Christie
out of both her relax and hand stances. So don't stay in your stances
for too long because you WILL get punished badly if you do. At the
moment, I see no retaliation possible against this move.

2) d/b+2 - This is a low sweep punch that can catch people of guard.
But if you play long enough with or against Steve, you will see that
this move start pretty slow and you can block it on reaction. I would
actually suggest that you block this move raither than just parry it.
After blocking, perhaps you can get a free d+1, or even a d,f+3 to
start a juggle. Nevertheless, watch out for this move to be pulled out
of middle of no where.

3) d/f+2,2 string and d+2,1 string - these are two great poking tool.
The d+2,1 hits low first and mid. However, the second move isn't
guaranteed if the first one hits. The d/f+2,2 string can be two upper-
cut, a delay gut punch, a face punch, or a stun punch, so becareful.
Both move have good recovery, but remember, they won't beat Christie's
1,2. Also, the d+2,1 can be use to knock you out of relax stance so
don't stay in it for too long.

4) 1,2,1,2_d+2 - This is purely meant to be poking. The last part of
the string is so obvious and so blockable that if a joke. Steve player
will always fall back on this to poke because is fast and has no block
disadvantages. If you get a player who abuse this, just d/b+4 or 3+4
them because both moves has high evasive properties. Furthermore, you
might want to play a keep away game with your f+4 because if is ever
countered, that means a free slippery kicks which leads to a juggle
that takes 50% of life off of this boxer.

5) Sways - Sways are always scary. They are mainly to distract you as
you don't know what to do and wait until Steve to attack. However,
there are many retaliation with Christie against a Sway happy player.
One of them is f+4. This move is great as it also has evasive(both
high and low) properties and that it tracks well with many possible
mixups after it. Also, both of her two new moves can finish a sway
happy steve. The qcf+3_fc,f+3 works will and it juggles. Also her new
evasive punch d/b+1+2 works will agains this situation too. But when
the battle gets tough and your really scare of the sway might counter
you... Just whip Steve with your jumping roundhouse u+4 and it will
do the trick.

Those are just a few of the move that I have mostly noticed. I also
like to warn to becareful with you own pokes because Steve has a really
mean and fast stun punch(d+1). The followups after it is unbelievable
and it can take a HUGE amount of your life off. Also, off of his sway
he can do an uppercut which is pretty telegraphed because of the sway
motion. Finally, when you get grounded, try to get up fast because
Steve has two mean okizeme punch 1+2,2 and d/b+2 that can be a big
pain in the neck.

To beat a good Steve means great setup and mixups. Try mixing up your
slippery kick into hand stands to surprise them. Also, use Christie's
stun kick string b+4..... and conjunction it with d/b+3 string. Note
that to perform three slippery kick is d/b+3~4,4 which can be mixed
up to handstance or b+4. I find the fc+3+4 work fairly well while
playing against Steve because it just gets ch a lot and I can juggle
off of it. However, if he blocks, I suggest you not to go into your
stance because both stance are easy target for Steve to box you out
of it.

- White Hair's View
-------------------
Watch out for Craig's mount... duh! If he does mount you, it will do
shitloads of damage. He would punch you tell you go insane and if you
try to get out, he will break your bones! Most but not all Craig
player would like to start the match in his Van Judo stance. It look
like his in a crouch but not really. If he does, I would suggest you
go into your crouch in the beginning and do a ws+2,3 to surprise him.
Not to worry because this new move is very fast and if the 2 is ch
than the 3 is guaranteed which leads to some badass juggles. Next,
Craig has a few poke. One of the poke starts out with his 1,2 punches.
After it he can do an elbow, a kick to headbutt, or get into his Van
Judo stance and mount you. Okay, there is a really simple way to
block this string, you just need to watch him. If after the 1,2, Craig
get into his Van Judo stance, DON'T JUST STAND THERE! d/b+1 poke him
out of it. If he is too far for d/b+1, try f+4 or just 3~4 which both
work really well. However, if he decides to kick you after the two
punch. Than you should imediatly crouch because most likely that he
will end the string with a headbutt which hits high. Also, the elbow
string 1,2,f+1 ends with high so you really have to watch what Craig
actually do after his 1,2 to know what to do. Another poke that Craig
player like to use is his beserker slap f+2,1,2,1. If even one of
tohse punch hits, than the rest is guaranteed. However, they all hits
high, seriously. I did urge you to crouch, but there is a reason I
won't because Craig has a crouch grab. A good Craig player would set
you up in a crouch so they can grab you. These setups include 1+2 and
u/f+4 which if hits, leaves you in crouch.

Try not to do moves that leaves you in a bad frame disadvantage. The
last thing you want to do is get booted by Craig half across the
screen with his b+4 power move. Watch out for his Aligator Charge
which at the beginning, he can't be knocked down or out of it. I would
wait for him to finish the move and rodeo spin him half across the
screen. Furthermore, watch out for his shoulder ram juggle starter
which evades low attacks. If he do this move and whiffs, be sure to
punish him to the fullist because of its bad recover time. One last
note I did like to mention is that Craig is a BIG character which
means okizeme and juggle are extra fun. Heck, it is so easy to juggle
Craig even ss+3+4 starter juggle are easy to do.

But the main point about fight Craig is not to keep your distance
because he would just get into his Van Judo stance and mount you. But
if in a situation that you are two far and he is charging at you, just
sidestep out of the way. Keep the heat on Craig and it shouldn't be
much of a problem. Oh yeah, do not stay on the ground because Craig
has some very nasty okizeme tricks that does loads off (ex b+1).
