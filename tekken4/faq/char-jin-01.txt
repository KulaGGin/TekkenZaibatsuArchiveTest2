1.0 - Oct 22, 2001 - The birth of this sorry excuse for an FAQ.  (If this FAQ
                    was a real kid, I'd abandon it! j/k)
1.1 - Oct 30, 2001 - Corrected errors and falsified strats
                     Added some juggles
1.2 - May 18, 2002 - Added the parry, more juggles, and major updates.
                     Changed email

**************
*Introduction*
**************

This FAQ is for all those players want to learn to use Jin in my cheesy way.
If you're expecting to play with honour, I suggest you stop reading, unless 
you're practicing your reading skills...you should stop reading for that too.  
If you're an expert Jin player, I suggest you press the Back button. There's 
nothing to see here...

I wrote this FAQ due to the number of requests I've been receiving. I have 
no right to call myself a Jin player, nor do I aspire to become one. I find 
that Jin is really easy to learn and to win with once you've figured out that
his game is based on string mixups rather than juggling. In other words, 
cheese. I know that Jin can be played with what people call skill and style.
Don't bother trying to flame me because I'm teaching how to be cheap (Let's 
see you write a better FAQ!). I'm sure when you picked up your first Tekken 
character, you were a scrub yourself.

Jin is really easy to learn and it only took Strider Yoshi 1 day to win 
consistently with the Kazama brand of dairy produce. I spent 2 days to learn
it.

This is an early version of the FAQ. There are many things still to sort out 
and a lot of aspects of the game that is still to be developed. If there are 
errors, holes, or strats to add, you are more than welcome to kindly send an 
email.

I'm assuming that you know the conventions such as 1_2 and so on.  Here's just
a rundown on all the buttons and directions.  I think the illustration below
insults your intelligence, but if ya stil need them...

I'm guessing that you're aware of the PS2 buttons, so I won't use an illustration
here.  Plus, everyone has their own button layout.

     WS: While Standing from crouch
      *: Hold the button                       SS: Side step (u_d)
     CH: Counter hit (interrupt an opp's move)  ~: Input next command immediately

************************
*Who is this "Mishima"?*
************************

If you think you're gonna be using the "old" Jin Kazama, you're all wrong. Chances
are, you found that out the hard way. He "unlearned" his Mishima style karate and
has gone back to traditional karate. You won't see him use moves like 112 or EWGF.
That's all you need to know about him. Wanna know his story? What do you think
this is? The Jin's Story FAQ?! Read that in some other FAQ or Tekken site.

Since he's not a Mishima anymore. He's not about juggling. He can juggle just
like any character, but don't expect damaging ones like Kazuya. Basically, you want
to mix up high, mid, and low hit strings with him.

***********
*Move list*
***********

Okay, maybe not. There is no movelist on this FAQ. Honestly, if you need one that
badly, check out www.tekkenzaibatsu.com; www.tekkencentral.com; and many other FAQs
that lists Jin's moves (Specifically Catlord's. You do know Catlord, don't you?).
Tekken websites also gives you frame rates, damage properties, and such detailed info
as well. Please check there if you need it that badly. I'm just assuming you know
all of Jin's moves and just want to know how to play him (or at least how I do).

****************
*In depth moves*
****************

The following are moves I use the majority of my matches. If some moves I find are
pretty useless, I won't mention it, unless it's so bad I gotta say why. In no
particular order, here are Jin's moves that I use a lot during his fights.  Word
of advice: These moves are what I consider to be good moves, but do not pick one
move and stick with it the entire match a la deathfist.

Jab String Setup (1,2...)

Jabbing has become an essential part of Tekken 4. Every character has a string that
is set up by 1,2.  Jin is no different. After 1,2 Jin can do the following:

 - 3 - Nice guard breaking mid kick. If this is blocked, you can mix up with either
  a mid hitting 3, or a low hitting d+4. If this kick connects, you can follow it
  up with a mini juggle.
 - 4 - More powerful high hitting kick. Better use this in juggles.
 - uf+1+2 - Not listed in any movelist, but Jin's throw flow easily from the jab
  strings. Maybe not like King's, but just like everybody else.

You are not limited to those moves after doing 1,2...use your imagination for better
setups.

Alternate Jab String Setup (2,1...)

I find this to be the better setup. The 2nd hit hits mid and the kick followup is
either mid or low. You can start with the mid hit by pressing df+1 and continue with
the mixups as well. Here's what you can do from this setup:

 - 4 - Mid kick
 - 4~4 - Low kick. Try not to abuse this. When opponents see this coming, they may
  interrupt with a jab or SS this kick altogether.
 - uf+1+2_2+4 - Once again, though not listed, throws go into this string fairly well.
  This is the one sequence I abuse the most.
 - d+3+4 - Mix this in if people are defensive and are ducking the throw attempt.

You are not limited to those moves after doing 2,1...use your imagination for better
setups.

Laser Series (b,f+2>1>...)

People complain that this isn't effective anymore. That's because this can't be used
in juggles...get over it. This still has it's uses in fights. Mix up this bad boy
and you'll be starting juggles often. The first 2 hits begin the same, but you may
use the following finishes (all moves except the Just Frame are delayable):

 - 2 - This punch knocks your opponent back whether it's blocked or not. Use this
  for breathing room.
 - d+2 - Best done delayed so you mix up between this and the Just Frame. You don't
  have to delay if your opponent tries SSing too early to avoid the Just Frame.
 - d+2* - Unblockable launcher.  Try not to do this version since it's SSable and
  interruptable, but try the following version of this move.
 - JF d+2* - To execute this, you can't delay the b,f+2,1,d+2*. Release 2 when Jin's
  fist is about to glow. If done right, there won't be much of a windup time on his
  unblockable launcher. Good for mixing up this and 2.

If ya wanna be really sneaky, sneak in a throw instead of a punch at any time during
the series.

Lead Thrust, Vertical Kick to Blade Kick (1,3~3,3)  After press d+1+2 for Glowing Fists

I don't really care if this move connects. I just use this as a custom string filler
and a setup for the Alternate Jab String Setup. You don't have to do the last 3, but
switch up with a d+4 for a low kick or restart your custom string. Watch out who you
use this against. If you're playing a reversal capable character, prepare to buffer a 
Chicken...don't even bother completing this against King. If some reason, you
successfully connected with the entire series, do the Glowing Fists for special FX.

Quick uppercut (df+2)

Hits mid, launches on a CH. Mix this within your Jab String Setups and maybe you'll
get lucky to launch on a CH. Nothing wrong with this move.

Rising uppercut (WS+2)

If you duck a move, this will guarantee to launch. Nothing wrong with that!

Electric Wind Hook Fist (EWHF) (CD~2)

I hope you are familiar with the EWGF concept because I really don't wanna explain.
If you don't do this properly, but CDed correctly, you'll get the WHF. This move
has the same properties as Jin's old EWGF, but this move is used to knock away
opponents rather than launch them into juggles.

Foot Sweep (CD+4) ~3_3+4 for Spinning Heel kick.  ~d+1+2 for Glowing Fists

Range is kinda small, but causes knock down if this lands. You have the option
of doing the Spinning Heel kick (guaranteed!) or Glowing Fists (special FX) once
this move connects.

Foot Slice (d+4)

Quick low hitting move. Good in customs and mixing up highs and lows.

Spinning Heel Kick (4~3)

A move he's changed but kept from TTT. This doesn't have the range it used to have.
This move causes a guard stun, so throw this out and roll back for some space. This
is best used at walls, okizeme, or guaranteed hits.

Can Can kicks (d+3+4)

A move he's kept from his previous Tekken adventure. If the 2nd kick connects, it
will launch...which is good at certain situations. Also a good stance buster like
Relax stance and Ling's AOP.

Regular throws (2+4_f+2+4)

A throw is a throw and it's essential in every Tekken game. If you don't have
enough time to use a command throw, go for one of these.

Choke Slam (uf+1+2)

This is your alternative to a regular throw. The damage is the same, but this has
a double punch escape, longer range, better animation, and leaves you in better
position for okizeme.

Change Position (1+3+f_u_d_b)

Something new added in Tekken 4. Get yourself out of a corner and put your
opponent into one by forcing a side switch with this command. You may shove your
opponent into a wall by pushing them into one. Your opponent is stunned briefly
which can set you up for quick jabs or some throws.

Parry (b+2+4)

Jin throws his opponent's limb to the side giving him a slight frame advantage and
putting your opponent off axis. Once you parry the first move in a string, you may
have to parry some more or block the rest of the string. Think of this parry as the
parry system in Street Fighter 3.

**********
*The Game*
**********

As you fight, you'll be put into various situations.  Here are some moves that I've
suggested during each scenario.

Pre fight - What you do right off the bat can determine the outcome and flow of the
           match.  Now that can move before throwing out moves, it's good to get
           some good positioning before duking it out.

 Before the announcer says fight:

   - SSing - A good idea to move yourself into open area and not close to a wall.
   - F dash - Show your aggressiveness before a fight. Also an indication that
    you'll go for a throw. Watch out for jabs or a throw when the fight begins.
   - B dash - Shows defensiveness and turtling. Watch out for throws.
   - Hop over - If you can time this right, just when the announcer shouts "Fight!"
    you can find yourself behind your opponent and with a free kick.

 When the announcer says "Fight":

   - Throw - Command throw or regular throw, if you've caught your opponent turtling
    at the start of the match, here's some good instant damage.
   - Pokes/Custom - Use some annoying but quick tick damage to start the match.  Your
    opponent would've probably have done the same. Best way to start on offense.
   - Idle - Stand still, block, then retaliate. Starting on defense can be
    rewarding at times. There's no risk of receiving a CHed attack from your
    opponent and you have the opportunity to read some tendencies and patterns in
    one string or series.  atch out for throws though.

Pokes/Custom - Now that everybody fights without a partner, ticking and chipping away at
              your opponent's life is more important than ever. Poking and jabbing is a
              big part of Jin's game. This is the key part of my cheese game. Here are
              some of the things you can chain together to make cheese:

   - Jab String Setups - No explanation, is there?
   - Alternate Jab String Setups - See the move above this.
   - Laser Series - Setup and mix up launchers, throws, or push your opponent away.
   - Lead Thrust, Vertical Kick to Blade Kick(1,3~3,3) - Just a filler
   - Quick Uppercut (df+2) - If your opponent tries interrupting.

Just remember that you do not have to complete each string before going into the next
one.  Be creative and your opponent will have many problems vs. your Jin fromage.

Whiff punisher - If your opponent does a move from too far and completely misses,
                you've successfully dodged it, or you blocked a move with lots of
                recovery, try these:

   - Throws - Usually devastating and spirit breaking. Most opponents hold B on
    reaction, raising the chances of success 100%...unless they duck on reaction...
    which can be a blessing in disguise...if you don't always go for the throw.
   - Launchers - You're guaranteed some hits after knocking them in the air.
   - Pokes/Custom - Start your barrage of annoyances and cheese with this.
   - EWHF - Knock your opponent away from you and hopefully into a wall with this.
   
Okizeme - Sure, hitting people when they're down is cheap (by scrubs), but it's legal.
         So, that should apply here.  Jin shouldn't be depending on okizeme to deal a
         lot of damage, but he can still do it.  These are the moves that I use in
         okizeme and their situations:

   - Foot Sweep (CD+4) - Good vs. opponents who remain lying down.
   - Foot Slice (d+4) - Good vs. opponents who remain lying down.
   - Spinning Heel Kick (4~3) - If you're real close and your opponent tries rolling
    back.    

Launchers - Jin has amazing launchers to initiate a juggle game.  Unfortunately,
           he doesn't have good moves for high damaging juggles.  Anyways, here are
           Jin's best launchers:

   - CH df+2
   - WS 2 - Always do this after ducking a move
   - b,f+2>1>d+2* - Not as reliable as the next two.
   - b,f+2>1>d+2 - Make a deadly launcher game by mixing it up between this and the
    next move.
   - b,f+2,1,JF d+2* - See the previous move.
   - d+3+4 - Hey! A move he's kept from Tekken 3 & TTT. Good punisher and post parry
    launch.

If you want to be successful with juggles, you have to have the mentality that all
your launchers will connect. That way when you see your opponent in the air, you
won't be caught off guard.

Juggles - Even though it's not the same as in the previous Tekkens, Jin Kazama does
         possess some ability to juggle, even if it is toned down. All juggles have
         been toned down in T4. Here are a few simple juggles that I use:

   - Any launcher,1,1,2,4
   - Any launcher,1,1,1,EWHF
   - Any launcher,1,1,1,f+4
   - Any launcher,1,fdash,1,2,3,d+4
   - WS+2,1,3,1,3~3,d+4
   - WS+2,1,1,1,3~3,d+4
   - ws+2,1,3,df+1,4
   - ws+2, 2,1, cd+1 - be careful not to hit 1+2 bec. of 2,1

That's all I need since the majority of my game consists of mixups from custom/jab
cheese, I mean strings.

Guaranteed stuff - While these aren't juggles, the followups after the moves are
                  guaranteed.  Here they are:

   - uf+1+2,d+4
   - 1,2,3,d+4 - If the 3 connects, the sweep is guaranteed.  Be quick.
   - 1,2,3,df+2,1,f,f+2 - The 3 in the Jab String has to connect for this to work.
   - 1,2,3,d/f+2,d/f+1,4
   - 1,2,3,d/f+2,CD+2 - Big Characters only

Walls - With the addition of walls, Tekken has taken an interesting twist.  
       Punishing your cornered opponent seems to be the focus of this Tekken.
       Catching somebody beside a wall or structured object can be so much fun.
       Slamming them into one is even more fun.  Here are some useful moves given
       in certain situations:

   - Throws - Bust these out since the majority of players will opt for a standing
    block.
   - Can Can kicks (d+3+4) - Best launcher in this situation.  Perhaps you can
    add more damage by juggling your opponent into a wall.  Better yet, you may
    finally be able to land the Laser series as a wall juggle.
   - Laser series - Be fast and maybe each hit will connect.  The first 2 will
    at least.
   - EWHF (CD~2) - Powerful and hopefully, you'll knock your opponent back into
    another wall.
   - Foot Sweep (CD+4) - Use when your opponent collapses or is blocking high.
   - Custom/jab strings - Continue your punishing cheese offense.  Be careful of
    wall techs.

*Final Words*

This FAQ wasn't that difficult to write, nor long. I just took my Craig FAQ and
added Jin and his moves plus a few adjustments. Always feel free to write (email's 
at the top of the page) and you will receive credit for any worthwhile contributions. 
I am only teaching how to cheese and get started with Jin. I really hope that a real 
Jin player writes an FAQ on him soon.  

I am not the greatest Jin player in the world or even in Toronto for that matter.  
Nor do I intend to be. He's not my kinda guy. There should better be some readers out 
there who can beat me using Jin. In the Tekken Central, GameFAQs, Toronto_Tekken,
Tekkenzaibatsu, or any Tekken related forums my screen name is Mini King. If you're 
from Toronto and you know Avex, Pascal, or the rest of the Tekken Crew, then they 
can tell you who I am.  f I ever come across an establishment with this game, I'll 
be there playing. Currently, my source for Tekken 4 has been on Campus Cove at York 
University. You'll know you're playing me since I'm the only guy who uses Craig Marduk.

I don't have internet access at home during the summer, so you may not get any
replies right away.

Remember, reading every FAQ will not substitute for experience. So go out there and play.
