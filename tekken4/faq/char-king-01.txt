*Introduction*
**************

This FAQ is for all those players who use King or want to learn to use him.  
We all have our reasons, so just continue reading and see what's up with him
in his latest Tekken adventure.

I made this FAQ and my previous FAQs mainly for myself.  I used it as a guide
for which moves to use under various conditions.  I've always believed in
sharing my wealth so I would like to pass on this knowledge to anybody else
who wishes to learn King.  If there are errors, holes, or strats, you are more
than welcome to kindly send an email.

I'm assuming that you know the conventions such as 1_2 and so on. Here's just
a rundown on all the buttons and directions. I think the illustration below
insults your intelligence, but if ya stil need them...

*Who is this Masked Man?*
*************************

King is a Mexican pro wrestler. That's all you need to know. Do you really
care about his story? What is this? The King's Story FAQ? Read for it somewhere
else. Given his fighting style, you know King won't be depending on fancy kicks and
punches, but devastating throws and holds. Actually, he can use both aspects, just
like in wrestling, just don't expect fancy strings and juggles with him. You'll be
setting up or retaliating with throws and simple powershots, then punishing opponents
with his ground game.

***********
*Move list*
***********

Okay, maybe not. There is no movelist on this FAQ. If you need one that badly,
check out www.tekkenzaibatsu.com; www.tekkencentral.com; and many other FAQs that
lists King's moves (Specifically Catlord's. You do know Catlord, don't you?).
Tekken websites also gives you frame rates, damage properties, and such detailed info
as well. Please check there if you need it that badly. I'm just assuming you know
all of King's moves and just want to know how to play him (or at least how I do).

****************
*In depth moves*
****************

The following are moves I use the majority of my matches. If some moves I find are
pretty useless, I won't mention it, unless it's so bad I gotta say why. In no
particular order, here are King's moves that I use a lot during his fights.

Jab Strings (1,2; 1,2,1; 2,1)

King's primary poke strings. When you're not throwing or punishing, you'll
probably be annoying your opponent using these. With the 1,2; 1,2,1; and f+2,1
strings, you can immediately do into a throw by pressing 2+4. If you think your
opponent will duck the throw attempt, crouch throw them with d+2+4. Since Tekken 4
has become a jab fest, you'll be using these as retaliation. Jabs are also a primary
source for setting up throws and your offense.

Low Jab Uppercut (d+1~N+2)

Another great poke string for King. Good vs. jabbers as well since King's 1st hit
has him ducking. Since Namco toned down d+1, this golden string doesn't shine as
much as it did back in TTT, but it's still useful and serves many purposes. Don't
abuse this as much as you may have done in TTT.

Elbow Sting (df+1>2)

Another useful poke string. Can be used for many more as well. If you catch the
elbow on a CH, your opponent will be knocked down, setting him up for okizeme.
You may also use this against crouching opponents and some special stances.

Low Drop Kick (db+4)

Effective vs. newbies and obvious turtlers. Can also be used in okizeme. I find
this also useful when running up to an opponent and whipping this out. Hits
countless times.  he bad part of this move is this oddly enough, can interrupted
by a jab. You'll probably stop using this often when your friends are familiar
with its windup...if you have friends.

Hop kick (ub_uf+4)

This is King's primary juggle starter. I mix this up along with King's
throws. When people duck in anticipation of a throw, a hopkick will knock them
into the air resulting in a juggle. Be warned, this is no longer guaranteed
after a low parry. Use the ub version of the hop kick as an escape tactic vs.
pitbulls. Though it won't do much damage, it'll keep you nice and safe.

Dynamite Uppercut (FC,df+2)

If you find yourself FC, use this when people develop a habit of crouching when
you do in fear of taking a Side Body Clutch Slam. Nice laucher for juggle/tech
roll trap setups.

Clothesline (f+1+2)

Mid range punisher. Nice and quick. Same as Armor King's back in TTT,
but nothing is guaranteed afterwards unfortunately. Also a lightning quick 
alternative to closing the gap to the knuckle bomb. If your opponent blocks this,
they get guard stunned and knocked further back, keeping you safe from retaliation.
Be warned, this move can be ducked and even punch parried, so try not to be
predictable with it.

Konvict kick (f,f+4)

I use this move only for punishing and keeping opponents at bay. If you catch
this on a CH, this move becomes a DDT. Anything into a throw is cool.

Shoulder tackle (f+2+3)

If I'm not CDing in, I use this to close the gap between myself and my opponent.
You'll find this move hits a lot since Tekken 4 has become more offense oriented
and the majority of your opponents will pitbull you. In order to do that, they
have to run up to you, thus putting their guard down. This is also effective
vs. Steve Fox's sways.

Elbow Drop (d+1+2)

Use this move only for okizeme. If your opponent likes to lie down, drop this on
them as punishment. Catch your opponent on a crumple stun or wall stun, and they
fall to the ground, you've got a sweet followup here.

Knucklebomb (uf+1+2)

A midrange substitute to the Shoulder Tackle. Come flying in at your opponent in
a few short frames. This move also serves well in okizeme. Bust this out when
you know your opponent will roll backwards.

Black Bomb (CD+1+2)

A mid hitting non-flying knucklebomb. Slower than the flying knee, but a useful
substitute. If you're lucky, you can catch this as a CH and get a free bounce 
juggle.

Suicide Dive (f,f+1+2)

A highly underrated move. As long as your opponent doesn't SS this, they will
suffer guard stun. From here, you can go for a throw or hop kick. This also
can be served as okizeme, but I don't recommend it.

Sucker Punch (SS+2)

Nothing like a quick punisher after successfully SSing a move. The stun after
creates time to CD into your opponent or whatever.

European Uppercut (WS+1+2)

Part of the FC mix up. This move always has great results. Hard to punish if
blocked, causes a crumple stun if this move hits normally, and a juggle launcher
if this is a CH which can happen a lot.

Blind Kick (BT 3) Just Frame 1+2 for a Neck Breaker

Use this to protect yourself if you find yourself BT. Can be used to follow up
a Muscle Buster. It's not guaranteed after a Disgraceful kick anymore. On a CH,
this move causes a crumple stun, which happens when your opponent thinks they've
got a free shot on your back. Set that up by pressing 1+2. If you caught your
opponent on a regular hit and your opponent is close enough, press 1+2 and King
will do a Neck Breaker throw. This is a Just Frame move and really hard to get.
The damage isn't worth the effort, but you can always try. It looks really cool.

Moonsault (1+4_f+1+4)  Can be done while BT

If this move isn't abused, this has a "deer-in-headlights" effect. Many people
freeze when King does this flip in the air. I use right after a Muscle Buster
or a Side throw.

Flying Knee (CD+4)

King is known for having 2 devastating chain throws after his crouch dash. Mix
up King's CD game by using this flying knee used by Armor King in TTT.  Good
damage and the opponent flies back, hopefully knocking them into a wall.

Inziguri Kick (df+3~4)

A cool looking move that is done like Lee. Although it's easier to do than
Lee's version, the 2nd kick can be blocked, ducked, and jabbed out of.  If you
catch this on a CH though, the 2nd kick is guaranteed. The 1st kick is useful
during your custom strings. Anyways, this is always useful for showing off,
unless the crowd has seen it thousands of times.

Spinning knife hand (1+2,1)

One of my favourite moves. If the 1st hit connects, the 2nd one is guaranteed.
There are so many uses for this move. This can be used as part of juggles,
punishers (the best part is, the 1st hit is irreversable which means bad news
vs reversal scrubs), and ending custom strings. You also have the option of
doing the first part of the move, leaving you BT. From here, you can go for
a Blind Kick to catch your opponent by surprise. If your opponent is too
close, but expecting a Blind Kick, surprise them with the Tornado Clothesline
unblockable by pressing 1+2. That trick will only work once per opponent.

Rolling sobat (f+4)

A simple jumping spin kick that has its uses. Give yourself breathing room by
using this, finish your custom strings, or punish crouchers. Simple yet effective.

Frankensteiner (df+3+4)

The damage isn't the same anymore. Oh well...if your opponent, who isn't that
good, is being too defensive and is visibly walking backwards, whip out the move
Scott Steiner invented. You can use this in okizeme as well.

Disgraceful Kick (b+4)

Strictly a punishing move and not to be thrown out at random. You'll find scrubs
doing this move a lot. Long reach and easy to chicken. Leaves you BT so if you're
fast enough and your opponent tries rolling backwards, you can land that BT 3. On
a clean hit, your opponent will drop straight to the ground. If not, they'll be
sent rolling back.

Thrust kick (b+3)

Another move taken from Armor King. Use this if the Disgraceful kick won't reach
and also as a juggle ender. That's all this move is useful for. Sends your
opponent fairly far back, which is good around walls.

Stagger kicks (d+3+4,4,4,[4,4 on a CH])

A move that was once guaranteed in okizeme.  But in Tekken 4, nothing's guaranteed
so don't be too eager to throw this out.  You can also use this for King's low game,
but it looks very scrubby.  If the first stagger kick connects on a CH, King can do
up to 2 more kicks as well, but they're all not guaranteed.

Stagger kick to uppercut (d+3+4,2)

If you're fighting a slow opponent that is used to the 3 low stagger kicks, mix it
up by throwing out an uppercut. On a CH, you can do up to 3 stagger kicks before
the uppercut. This move is also nice in okizeme when your opponent rolls back.  If
they do, both hits are guaranteed. If your opponent opts to lie still, only the
stagger kick will connect.

Ankle Swipe (FC,df+1)

You should only use this move under two circumstances.  fter doing a sweep from KND
and you've successfully knocked your opponent on their ass, use this. This connects
88% of the time. I use this after a successful Low Drop Kick as well.

Regular throws (2+4_f+2+4_2+4~B)

A throw is a throw and it's essential in every Tekken game. If you don't have
enough time to use a command throw, go for one of these. Be warned, okizeme isn't
guaranteed after these throws. Now that really screwed King over.

Side Body Clutch Slam (FC,db,d,DB+1+2)

With the abuse of 1,2 in Tekken 4, I personally find this throw great vs. those
scrubs. King ducks under those jabs then rises into the Rock's finisher. This throw
has amazing tracking ability as well. Though it is good when mastered, nothing is
guaranteed after it. Try and get used to doing the motion and you've just developed
an invaluable tool in your game. This throw is meant to be set up not thrown at
random.

Giant Swing (f,hcf+1)

Now that the majority of throws in Tekken 4 are broken using 2 or 1+2, the
Giant Swing has gotten much more effective this time around because of its
different break. What makes this throw even better is if it's been tech rolled,
your opponent takes 45 damage, which is more than half the damage of the GS and
that's more than most other throws. If you toss an opponent into a wall or
structured object, that's even more golden.

Tombstone (db,f+2)

This is King's most powerful throw excluding a non techrolled Giant Swing (but who
can't tech out of that?). The triple ground throw isn't guaranteed anymore.
Always looks cool. This is a throw I like buffering before a round starts.

Muscle Buster (qcb+1+2)

Same old throw from T3 and TTT. The guessing game after it is guaranteed as well.
If your opponent lies still, go for a moonsault. If your opponent attempts to roll
backwards or to the side, go for the Blind Kick.

Kneelift (WR_f,f,f+2+4)

A cool looking throw done while running. This is effective vs. wall techs and turtles.  
Sadly, this can only be setup while running or f,f,f.

Jumping powerbomb (d+2+4)

King will only land this on 3 of your opponent's positions. Off a crouch, off a
tech roll, and after parrying a low kick. This is effective in a tech roll trap.
If your opponent has great reaction or reads you like a book, this move is useless
since it's breakable.

Ground throws (db_df_DB_DF+2+4)

Obviously, this is something done in Okizeme. There are no more guaranteed
ground throws after throws like the Tombstone and right kick reversal anymore.
You'll get this if your opponent stupidly stays on the ground for too long. At
least this time, ground throws land more often and you don't whiff even if you're
just a single sprite away from your opponent. You can catch side rolling opponents.

Kick reversal (b+2+4) On a Right Kick, press 3+4 for a Figure Four Leglock

King is blessed with having an irreversable kick reversal. Take advantage of it
vs. kick happy players such as Hwoarang scrubs or predictable Christie strings
(which shouldn't happen). An elbow drop is guaranteed after a left kick
reversal and if you press 3+4 during the right kick reversal animation, King will
give his opponent a figure four leg lock. The figure four is a Just Frame input.

Change position (1+3+f_b_u_d)

Something new added in Tekken 4. Get yourself out of a corner and put your
opponent into one by forcing a side switch with this command. You may shove your
opponent into a wall by pushing them into one. Your opponent is stunned briefly
which can set you up for a quick jab or some throws.

Chain throws (See the Chain throws section)

Do not neglect this part of the game. There is a reason why King has them. This
was why I picked King in the first place. Perhaps others did as well. (Yeah, 'twas
scrubby!!)  Strike fear into other people's hearts by doing them or threatening to
do them. Just don't abuse it. When you find out about the uses of King's other
moves, you'll be using this less and less...but I didn't say not at all.

**********
*The Game*
**********

As you fight, you'll be put into various situations. Here are some moves that I've
suggested during each scenario.

Pre fight - What you do right off the bat can determine the outcome and flow of the
           match. Now that can move before throwing out moves, it's good to get
           some good positioning before duking it out.

 Before the announcer says fight:

   - SSing - A good idea to move yourself into open area and not close to a wall.
    Also a setup to some SS buffered moves.
   - F dash - Show your aggressiveness before a fight. Also an indication that
    you'll go for a throw. Watch out for jabs and throws when the fight begins.
   - B dash - Shows defensiveness and turtling. Try B dashing repeatedly by doing
    qcb,qcb...this is a way to buffer a Tombstone before fighting.
   - Hop over opp. - If you can time it right, you'll find yourself behind your
    opponent just as the announcer starts the fight.
   - FC - Assume this position and have your opponent guess what you'll be doing.
    See the FC aspect of the game to find out your options from here.    
   - WD - Repeated CDs can scare your opponent into guessing between a chain throw,
    Black Bomb, or flying knee.

 When the announcer says "fight":

   - Throw - Command throw, regular throw, or CDed throw, if you've caught your
    opponent turtling at the start of the match, here's some good instant damage.
    A buffered Tombstone's my fave here.
   - Jabs/pokes - Use some annoying but quick tick damage to start the match. Your
    opponent would've probably have done the same. Perhaps you could set up a
    throw from here too.
   - Hopkick - Juggles are always nice.
   - Spinning knifehand - Good vs. reversal scrubs plus if the 1st hit connects,
    the 2nd is guaranteed. Can't be punished if the move is blocked. Sounds like
    a good start.
   - FC mix up - See the FC section about your options.
   - CD moves - See the CD section about your options. Start a deadly guessing
    game this way.
   - Idle - Stand still, block, then retaliate. Starting on defense can be
    rewarding at times. There's no risk of receiving a CHed attack from your
    opponent and you have the opportunity to read some tendencies and patterns in
    one string or series. Watch out for throws.

Pokes/custom strings - Now that everybody fights without a partner, ticking and
                      chipping away at your opponent's life is more important than
                      ever. Poking and jabbing is a big part of King's game since
                      he doesn't have any long strings. Here are a few quick
                      strings I use when playing. Put these in combination to make
                      your own custom strings:

   - Jabs (1,2,[1]) - Standard poke for everybody. The first 2 hits high so you're
    kinda screwed if your opponent is crouching. You have the option to the a
    throw after the 2nd or 3rd jab. This string also moves you forward.
   - Jab uppercut (2,1) - My favourite little string. The 2nd hit strikes mid and
    King moves forward a bit. My favourite jab setup for the Giant Swing.
   - Low jab to Uppercut (d+1~N+2) - This move has lost its priority from TTT.
    Still a good string anyways since you duck on the 1st hit. Nothing is
    guaranteed after the 2nd hit and a quick jab is what you'll get in return if
    your opponent blocks it.
   - Elbow sting (df+1>2) - Both hits mid and if the 1st elbow is a CH, your
    opponent hits the ground. Bait your opponent into a Spinning knife hand
    after using this string.
   - Ankle kick (df+4) - Quick low kick. Something useful in poking. Low kicks
    keep your opponent from high parrying or reversing by throwing this out once in
    a while.
   - Mid kick (df+3) - The 1st kick in King's new Inziguri kick move. You don't
    always have to use the Inziguri all the time. This move has always been
    effective in poking. When your opponent is used to seeing other poke/custom
    strings after this, whip out the 2nd kick and that'll be the last time they try
    interrupting with their heads up. Also good for tracking SSers to King's left.

Whiff punisher - If your opponent does a move from too far and completely misses,
                you've successfully dodged it, or you blocked a move with lots of
                recovery, try these:

   - Command Throws - Usually devastating and spirit breaking
   - Hopkick to juggle - When opponents always react by ducking, since they think
    they're gonna get thrown, which is natural against King.
   - Disgraceful Kick (b+4) - Just a powershot now. I bet you're asking, why didn't
    you add the BT 3 after it? The reason is, if you get caught with the initial
    kick, all you have to do is mash 2, recover straight up, and you'll block the
    Blind kick. So, that combo isn't guaranteed anymore. Doesn't mean you shouldn't
    try it though. If you get lucky, you could get a Neck breaker after the
    blind kick.
   - Super Kick (b+3) - For times when the Disgraceful kick can't reach. Will
    guarantee to send the opponent rolling back. Useful after blocking deathfists.
   - Konvict kick (f,f+4) - Knock them back and if your opponent tries to interrupt,
    you've got a CH DDT.
   - Rolling Sobat (f+4) - Quick and easy if you're feeling brainless. If you
    messed on your timing and your opponent blocks, you're safe from retaliation. This
    kick also has tracking properties against SSers.
   - Clothesline (f+1+2) - Be like a real pro wrestler and punish with clotheslines.
   - Knucklebomb (uf+1+2) - Knock an opponent on their ass and follow it up
    immediately with an Elbow Drop for great damage.
   - Shoulder Tackle (f+2+3) - With an opponent rolling back from the blow, there's
    a chance to knock them into a wall. Better if you're at long range.
   - Spinning knifehand (1+2,1) - Decent damage. If the 1st hit connects, the 2nd
    hit is guaranteed. The 1st hit is irreversable so that means people who reverse
    by reaction will get nailed.
   - CD mixup - Since your opponent will be on the defensive, make them worry about
    what they'll be eating when King comes CDing in. Good time for Chain Throws.
   - Throw setups - Using one of your favourite throw setups will increase chances
    of landing a throw. Sometimes, players duck on reaction after whiffing or
    recovering. Use setups to keep them standing before throwing.

Okizeme - In this version of Tekken, nothing is guaranteed in okizeme anymore. No
         character gets a free hit. This doesn't mean you can't hit them while
         they're down. Okizeme is more of a guessing game now rather than
         guaranteed ground beating. These are the moves that I use in okizeme and
         their situations:

   - Elbow Drop (d+1+2) - If your opponent lies still. Guaranteed after a kick
    reversal if you're quick.
   - Ground Throws (db_DB_df_DF+2+4) - If your opponent lies still for too long.
    It can also catch side rolling opponents at times.
   - Stagger Kick (d+3+4) - Will always nail your opponent.
   - Knuckle Bomb (uf+1+2) - If your opponent rolls backwards.
   - Stagger Kick to uppercut (d+3+4,2) - If your opponent rolls backwards.
   - Flying Knee (CD+4) - If your opponent rolls backwards and you're close enough.
   - Moonsault (1+4_f+1+4) - If you're in BT and your opponent lies still. Works
    right after the Argentine Back Breaker, an opponent lying still after eating a
    Muscle Buster, or standing straight up from a Disgraceful Kick in order to avoid
    the Blind Kick.
   - Low Drop Kick (db+4) - Good tracking low hitting move.
   - Ankle Swipe (FC,df+1) - Use this only after landing a KND 3 or a Low Drop Kick
    while your opponent is lying still or trying to roll back.
   - Hop over, Blind kick (BT 3) - If your opponent likes to lie still and use
    wake ups vs. you.
   - Shoulder Tackle (f+2+3) - If your opponent rolls back. Can be more reliable
    than the Knuckle Bomb since it doesn't require a diagonal.

Throw setups - This is a big part of King's game. Being a wrestler, he needs to
              use throws to win fights. The main throws you'd like to land are the
              Giant Swing, Tombstone, Muscle Buster, and the Side Body Clutch Slam.
              Here are a few common setups:

   - f+1,hcf+1 - If you are new to King and the concept of throw setups. I that
    suggest that you begin learning the concept of throw setups by doing this simple
    setup. All you are simply doing is a single jab, buffered into a Giant Swing. 
   - Jab strings - Kinda self explanatory. My favourite is the Giant Swing tick
    (2,1,Giant Swing)
   - WS+4,Giant Swing - Whiffs at times, but still possible.
   - df+1>2,Giant Swing - Don't abuse too much 'cause the 2nd hit from the Elbow
    Sting can be interrupted.
   - d+1,SBCS - d+1 gets you into a FC. Then from there, it's Side Body Clutch
    Slam.
   - KND b_f,f+1+2,SBCS - Another setup into a Side Body Clutch Slam. This one's
    better to do if your opponent blocked your cross chop from knock down position.
   - f+1+3, Giant Swing - You can buffer the f-change position into a Giant Swing.
    Amazing results.

Note:  If your opponent if familiar with your setups and ducks, mix up the throw
     with a Hopkick, Rolling Sobat, or Spinning Knife Hand.

SSing - Side Stepping has become even more important than ever in Tekken 4. This
       is an effective way to evade attacks and punish. King also has moves that
       he can do off a SS. Here they are:

   - Sucker Punch (SS+2) - King will do the same punch as Armor King did back in
    TTT. This punch is nice and quick and it also knocks the opponent back,
    setting you up for a CD.
   - Gory Guerrero Special (SS+2+4) - A common way King started one of his Chain
    throws back in the previous Tekkens.  This is the scrub's choice for Chain
    throws, but it can still be deadly.
   - GGS cancel (SS+2+4~b) - When people see the wind up for the SS+2+4, they will
    always duck on reaction to avoid the throw.  Well, lucky for you, King can
    cancel this throw and end up in FC.  Actually, I prefer using a hopkick to a
    juggle when my opponents tried ducking in order to avoid the GGS.
   - Tombstone Piledriver (db,SS~f+2) - Whip out an unexpected buffered Tombstone
    right off the SS.
   - Spinning knifehand (1+2,1) - Cancelling a SS into this is just real sweet.
    It works on so many levels. You can catch a crouching opponent who thought
    you'll go for a SS+2+4 a little too early. This also serves as a good punisher
    for a move you've freshly SSed. As long as you don't whiff both hits, you're
    pretty safe.

FC mix ups - A crouching opponent can be a dangerous opponent. Just look at Bryan
            and Kaz. King can become a serious threat while he's ducking. Some
            people like to start the FC by simply ducking, while others use d+1 or
            d+4 before getting into the crouch. Holding D after diving moves will
            leave King in FC. Here are some useful moves from the crouch position:

   - Rising Kick (WS+4) - A nice simple yet effective while rising kick. You can
    use this to set up a Giant Swing or other moves. This leaves you relatively
    safe from retaliation if blocked.
   - European Uppercut (WS+1+2) - If this connects, great! Leaves you safe if
    blocked as well.
   - Dynamite Uppercut (FC,df+2) - If people expect the throw, launch them with
    this mid hitter.
   - SBCS (FC,db,d,DB+1+2) - Good damaging throw and sort of like a low hit
    alternative.
   - Stagger kicks (FC,df+4,...) - Kinda scrubby but a quick low hit alternative.

CD mix ups - King's CD is even faster than ever. To my observation though, the
            range of the crouch dash is shorter. The best time to do a CD mix up is
            when your opponent is about to rise to their feet from CD range. Anyways,
            here are some good options upon attacking from a CD:

    - Chain throws (CD+1+4_2+3) - Something King's known for doing. Please see the
     Chain throws section.
    - Flying knee (CD+4) - Stronger than ever and knocks your opponent pretty far
     back and hopefully into a wall.
    - Hop kick (uf+4) - Nothing like a launcher buffered from a CD.
    - Konvict kick (CD,f+4) - A buffered Konvict Kick can be useful if your
     opponent ducks a lot when they see King CDing.
    - Black bomb (CD+1+2) - An alternative to the Flying Knee. If you're lucky and
     catch this on a CH, your opponent will bounce, thus resulting in a juggle.

Launchers - King only has 1 reliable launcher to start juggles. It's not too
           powerful which was probably why his juggles have never been that damaging.
           He has a few other launchers, but they aren't that good. Anyways, here
           they are:

   - Hopkick (uf+4) - King's best launcher out there. Hits mid so ducking enemies
    aren't safe.  Comes out quick and has a lot of priority.
   - CH European uppercut (WS+1+2) - Useful after ducking in a FC game.
   - Dynamite Uppercut (FC,df+2) - Only useful after blocking a low move with lots
    of recovery and mixing with the SBCS.
   - CH Jaguar Uppercut (f,f+2) - Not that reliable. If this move is blocked, lots
    of punishment will be coming your way.
   - CH Black Bomb (CD+1+2) - This will result in a cool looking bounce juggle.
    Once again, don't depend on this since the bounce only occurs on a CH.

If you want to be successful with juggles, you have to have the mentality that all
your launchers will connect. That way when you see your opponent in the air, 
you won't be caught off guard.

Juggles - King isn't a strong juggler like Kazuya. He does possess the ability
         though. Juggles have been toned down in T4, but you need to be able to do
         them with King in order to create an effective mix-up in throw setups. If
         your opponent ducks a lot, do not hesitate to launch them in the air. Here
         are a few that I use (these are juggles after the launcher):

   - f,2,1,1+2,1 - This is a common juggle since T3. You'll have to wait a bit
    this time in order to connect with the 2,1. You have to move forward first so
    the 1+2,1 can reach. Classic TTT King juggle.
   - 2,1,d+3+4,2 - In case you were going for the previous juggle, but the 2,1
    knocked your opponent a little far for the 1+2, the stagger kick to uppercut
    will reach.
   - 2,1,b+4_b+3_f+4 - A simple juggle that ends with one of King's various power
    kicks.
   - f+1+2,df+1,2,d+3+4,2 - Clothesline juggles are probably the best way to juggle
    now since juggles have been toned down.

Tech roll traps - Kind of a juggle, but these work (in their ways) if your
                 opponent techrolls when they fall, they will be caught with the
                 last hit.  Here are a few that I know after a launcher:

   - 1,2,f,f+2+3 - Classic TTT King tech roll trap.  Watch out though, you're
    prone to okizeme because the flying cross body doesn't pin your opponent to
    the ground.
   - 1+2,1,dash,d+2+4 - Go for this if you think your opponent will tech roll.
    If they don't, go for the stagger kick to uppercut.
   - uf+4,dash,d+2+4 - Again, if you don't think your opponent will tech roll, go
    for the stagger kick to uppercut.

If your opponent does not fall for the trap, a d+3+4,2 is guaranteed.

Guaranteed stuff - These aren't juggles exactly, but after doing these moves, 
                  their followups are guaranteed.  Here's stuff King can do in
                  sequence:

   - FC,df+1,WS+4,d+3+4,2 - If you can read, if you knocked down an opponent from
    the Ankle swipe, the followups are guaranteed.
   - Kick reversal, d+3+4 - If you're fast enough, you can replace d+3+4 with d+1+2.
   - FC,db,d,DB+1+2, d+3+4
   - uf+1+2,d+1+2
   - Side throw,f+1+4 - Moonsault is guaranteed after any side throw.
   - KND 3,FC,df+1 - Not exactly guaranteed if your opponent is on an incline or
    if you didn't catch the sweep deep enough.
   - CH BT 3, u+2+4

Walls - With the addition of walls, Tekken has taken an interesting twist.  
       Punishing your cornered opponent seems to be the focus of this Tekken.
       Catching somebody beside a wall or structured object can be so much fun.
       Slamming them into one is even more fun. Here are some useful moves given
       in certain situations:

   - Stagger Kick (d+3+4) - If your opponent falls to the ground from a wall stun,
    this kick will float them back up and into the wall again.  Try not to use
    other followups since a wall tech will leave you open.  That doesn't mean you
    shouldn't try it out.
   - Knee Lift (f,f,f+2+4) - Use this throw if your opponent wall techs
   - Spinner (1+2) - Mid hitting and irreversable.  Leaves you BT which can be a
    good thing in this case.  Doing the Knife Hand is optional, but if your
    opponent wall teched, you're in for a lot of trouble.
   - Elbow Sting (df+1>2) - Guaranteed hits.  This is always a safe way to go.
   - Elbow Drop (d+1+2) - If your opponent fell to the ground, just drop this on
    them.
   - Moonsault (1+4) - Works if your opponent is down or hopefully, you'll get the
    "freeze" effect from a standing opponent.
   - Shoulder Tackle (f+2+3) - If you're too far from a standing stunned opponent.
   - Flying Knee (CD+4) - Fancier alternative to the Shoulder Tackle.
   - Command throws - If your opponent wall teched, they'll instinctively go for a
    standing block  This is where command throws come in handy.
   - Ground throws - Allow your opponent to drop to the ground and use whatever
    ground throw will be granted to you. After a while, this will scare your
    opponent into rolling backwards, thus setting them up for more damage with
    walls.

**************
*Chain throws*
**************

This is something King is known for doing. Hell, this was a main reason why I
picked him in the first place, aside from the fact that he looked different from
everybody else because he wore a mask. Chain throws are an easy yet cool way
to deliver high amounts of damage to your opponent.  They also give you that
psychological advantage as well. I really hope you didn't skip all the
way down to this section. I demand that you read everything before this section in
order to use King effectively.  

Before I begin, this is how the links to each throw will be charted.

Throw Chart (Starter name(A))

A-----C---E
  |   |   |
  |   |   |
F--   B   D

Throw A initiates the chain. Throw A can be followed by throw B or throw C.
Throw C can be followed by throw E or throw D. Throw F is an optional starter.

Now for the chains...

Throw Chart (Reverse Armdrag Take Down or Gory Guerrero Special) 
 
A--C-----F---G--I
   |         |
   |         ---J
   |
B--D---------G--I
         |   |
         |   ---J
         |
         E---H--I
             |
             ---J

Note: Throw D will not link to throw C.

A. Reverse Arm Drag Take Down (DF+1+3_2+4) Escape: 1_2 depending on command

This may be familiar to all you Tekken 2 vets out there. This path leads you to
King's longest and most damaging chain, but it isn't really a good series. If your
opponent tried to break the initial start up, chances are, they'll escape the next
throw. If you used 1+3 to initiate the throw, the escape was 1 and the same for
the next link.  I can't really do the throw and it's one I stay away from. It
looks a lot like Paul's shoulder throw. If you will be using this, at least use
the 1+3 one since most of the other chains are broken with 2.

B. Gory Guerrero Special (SS+2+4_df+1+2_df,DF+2+4) Escape: 2_1+2 for df+1+2

Probably the multi-throw starter you'll see most often, especially the
side step version. You'll see scrubs do that most often. The side step
version is cancellable by tapping b, which ironically, can be more useful
than the actual throw. The (df,DF+2+4) will only catch a crouching opponent.

C. Backdrop (2,1,1+2) Escape: 1_2 same as A

If your opponent couldn't escape the Reverse Arm Drag, all they have to do is tap
the other punch button to escape. In other words, it's the same escape as the
Reverse Arm Drag. Looks like the suplex counter off a side headlock on tv.

D. Cannonball (2,2,1+2) Escape: 2 only after Backdrop

This move is guaranteed after you do it from the GGS. Not much to say here.
Buffer the move to increase the chances of doing it. Tap 2 twice and hold it then
tap 1. You'll get this move if you tried a SS GGS, but caught them on the side or
from behind.

E. Inverted Atomic Drop (3+4,1+2,1+2+4) Escape: 2

Common move you see in wrestling. Taking this path results in greater damage, but
this is one sequence most vets know, actually, they should know them all.

F. German Suplex (3+4,1+2) Escape: 1

It looks better on TV and by Chris Benoit. Can't comment much 'cause I've never
done it in a match. At least it's follow up is inescapable when you use this.

G. Powerbomb (1,2,3+4) Escape: 1 only after Cannonball

Nice standard wrestling powerbomb. More damaging than the Inverted Atomic Drop,
but only 1 follow up after that.

H. Sit-down Powerbomb (1,2,3+4,1+2) No escape

Different looking powerbomb, but at least it's inescapable. This and the Inverted
Atomic Drop adds up to more damage than the Powerbomb, plus it has one more move to
go.

I. Giant Swing (2,1,3,4) Escape: 1

A weaker version of the command throw. Not as much damage as the other follow up,
plus it can be tech rolled. To make matters worst, this is the most common
follow-up and the one scrubs use most often. Do it only when your opponent escapes
the Muscle Buster often, expects a Muscle Buster, or just taps 2 when caught in a
chain throw.

J. Muscle Buster (3,1,2,3+4,ALL) Escape: 2

Most damaging final move of this series. Looks cool and you can follow it up with
a Moonsault or a Blind kick. I normally go for this move, but there are times when
people will break it. I haven't seen this yet on TV, but then again, I don't get
to watch the real Mexican wrestling.

Throw Chart (Butterfly Underhook Driver [a weird looking Pedigree-like maneuver])

A--B
|
---C
         
A. Jaguar Driver (qcf+1) Escape: 1_3+4 during throw animation

What an awful move. Less damage than a standard King throw and a late escape.
One to stay away from. I only do this by accident when trying a Giant Swing
command.

B. Face slam (1+2 during A.) Escape: Same as A.

Instead of slamming the opponent on the back of their neck, King changes the throw
into a Pedigree variation. So it's 5 more points just to change the throw, but a
standard King throw does more. Stay away!

C. Boston Crab (1+2,3,4,1+2 after 1 sec. of throw animation) No Escape

It adds 25 more, so if you get caught doing A, go for this one.

Throw Chart (Standing Heel Hold)

A--B--E
|
|--C
|
---D

A. Standing Heel Hold (CD+2+3) Escape: 2

My personal favourite of the chain throws. Decent initial damage and the follow
ups will guarantee you at least 60 damage in total if you get one them. The only
setback is, if the followups are escaped, you will eat 10 points in damage. Do it
and you'll see why it's the preferred throw.

B. Indian Death Lock (1+2,1,3,1+2) Escape: 1+2

Nice lock, adds up to 60 damage, double button escape, and there's one inescapable
move to go. Great move, but don't do this too often or your opponent might get
smart about it. If you've first caught a vet with move A, don't try using this
link yet.

C. STF (1,2,3,1+2) Escape: 1_1+2 to reverse

Looks nice, least damaging follow up though.  I only use it when I know one more
follow up will finish the guy. Good for mix ups too. The reverse window is really
small, so you shouldn't worry much about it.
 
D. Scorpion Death Lock (1+2,3,1,1+3) Escape: 2

Of the follow ups from A, this is the most damaging, but it ends here. I use this
when I don't feel like doing the STF, but the 2nd lock will finish the opponent.  
If your opponent keeps tapping the 1+2 buttons during hold A, switch up to this one.

E. Romero Special (1,3,4,1+2,3+4) No Escape

Looks awfully painful, most damaging, and inescapable. There's no reason why you
shouldn't do this move, unless link B kills them.

Throw Chart (Arm Breaker)

A---B---E
|   |
|   ----F
| 
----C---G
|
D

A. Arm Breaker (CD+1+4) Escape: 1

Name says it all. I only do this move if my opponent escapes the Standing Heel
Hold repeatedly. This move has gotten better now that the majority of throws are
broken with the 2 button. Having a 1 button escape is now even better. Other
than that, I don't try this often, unless I'm gonna show off as well.
 
B. Cross Face Chicken Wing (2,1,1+2+3) Escape: 1+2

Decent move, double button escape, and has most damaging follow up. It's really
easy to do if you buffer. Hold 2, hold 1, tap 3. It's that simple. Too bad it's
a well known prerequisite for a well known move.

C. Side Russian Legsweep (1+2,4,2+4) Escape: 2

Looks cool and it's follow up is inescapable. I'm not sure if people know about
this move since the majority of the time, you'll see a Cross Face Chicken Wing.
Honestly, of this series, I go for this unless I'm playing a guy who has absolutely
no idea about the Rolling Death Cradle.

D. Triple Arm Breaker (1+2,1+2) Escape: 1

Stay away. Looks bad, plus it's just as easy to do link B and it does the same
damage, but there's no follow up for that move. If you're bored with the other links
or just want to show your opponent there's more, by all means go for this.

E. Reverse Guillotine Choke (2,1,3,1+2+4,1+2+4) Escape: 1

Nice follow up and guarantees you one more shot at your grounded opponent. Do this
when your opponent will try and break a Rolling Death Cradle. Which means they just
mash 2 during chains.

F. Kiwi Roll (1+3,3+4,2+4,1+2,1+2+3) Escape: 2

Coolest looking move and most damage in the least amount of moves. Unfortunately,
this is a well known move. Every expert in the Tekken community knows about this
move and can break it. This can really difficult to execute because of it's
sequence. I can get it about 3/4 of the time with my own sequence. Here's how I
do it: I press 1+3 with my index finger and thumb, 3+4 with my index and middle
finger, 2+4 with index and thumb, 1+2 with the index and middle and hold it so I
can just press 3 with my thumb. This takes a lot of practice to do it. What's
really pissing me off now, is the RDC can be mashed. So now, you don't even have
to bother with the above. Damn!!!

G. Arm Lock (4,3,4,3+4,1+2) No Escape

I can't see why you shouldn't go for it since it's inescapable.

Throw Chart (Ultimate Tackle) 

A---B-----G
  | |
  | ---C--E
  | |
  | ---D--F
  |
  C-------E
  |
  D-------F

A. Ultimate Tackle (FC,d+1+2_WR) Escape: 2_1+2 upon hitting the ground to reverse 

A move I'm not too fond of doing since it can be reversed leaving you at your
opponent's mercy.

B. Punches (1,2,1_2,1,2) Escape: 1 if started with 2_2 if started with 1

Not much to stay, just a standard mount and punch.  I prefer to stay away from this
move since it's easily blocked.  Do it only if you know your opponent will try to
escape link C or D.  If done from behind, these punches are inescapable.

C. Cross Arm Lock (1+2) Escape: 1+2,2,2,2,2[,2 to reverse]

Standard arm submission.  Easy to do, but can be reversed by those with an arm lock
followup which are Jin, Paul, Nina, Craig, and King.

D. Cross Leg Lock (3+4) Escape: 1+2,1,1,1,1[,1 to reverse]

Same as C, but you're doing this to a leg. I prefer this one since no one really
sees it and it has a really cool follow up.

E. Arm Lock (1+2,1+2) No Escape

Just like all inescapable followups, you should always do this.

F. Arm Coil to Cross Face (1+2) No Escape

Same as E but a bit harder to do. You must press 1+2 just when King's back hits
the ground on move D. Looks cool too. This is a Just Frame move.

G. More punches (1,2_2,1) Escape: Same as A

It's the same as A. Refer to that.

Throw Chart (Irish Whip)

A-----B
   |
   ---C
   |
   ---D
   |
   ---E 

A. Irish Whip (b+1+2) No Escape

This throw doesn't do any damage, but is inescapable. Even though the followups
are weak, they may serve a purpose. This move is the same throw that wrestlers
use to throw people into the ropes. In Tekken 4, there are no ropes, but there
are walls. If you're facing a wall, there's not better way to get a stun than by
throwing your opponent into a wall. You don't have to use any of the followups
and use the Shoulder Tackle.

B. Ground smash (3+4) Escape: 3+4

This throw doesn't guarantee ground throws now that Tekken 4 reduced the recovery
on the ground.  

C. Knockdown (2+4) Escape: 2

King skips his opponent off the ground. Would be useful if the opponent skipped
into a wall...

D. Turnaround fake (1+2)  Escape: 1+2

Another useless link. Don't even bother.

E. Fake out (1+3) Escape: 1

Nothing really useful can be done here. Basically just fakes the whip and leaves
your opponent in the same position before you chucked him.

That's all for the chain throws. I really hope you don't depend on these during
your matches. People say that you should never do them because they're easy to
break. Well, that's all up to the King user and the opponent if he chooses to
look at your hands. Anyways, getting caught in them always pisses people off and
throws them off their game. That's why you should do them. Remember, the object
of a Chain throw isn't to do as much damage as possible, but to complete as many
successful links as you can during each series.  

I know that chain throws can be accomplished by mashing the buttons. Though it
is possible, I strongly suggest you do not do this.

teaching others out there how to use King doesn't mean that I won't learn anything
here.

I only listed and suggested moves to use during each aspect of play. Some King
players perfer to set up their opponents using throws. Others may like to mix up a
CD and FC game. There are many ways to play him. Well, in the end, the best play
similarly. Right now, Tekken 4 is fairly new. There's so much to experiment and
no fighter fights the same back in TTT.

If you want some character specific strats and other types of strats, I suggest
that you check out Darkmanx's FAQ. The website is listed on the previous section.
Though his style may differ from mine, he has found success with King his own way.

If you ever catch a guy in a multi-throw and you see them going mad on the
stick, please tell them that doing that is useless and to stop it. Nobody likes
to play with damaged joysticks.

I am not the greatest King player in the world or even in Toronto for that
matter. I can't even do his moves 100% of the time (especially when you've got
awful sticks). I'm sure there are some readers out there who can beat me using
King.  In the Tekken Central, GameFAQs, Toronto_Tekken, Tekkenzaibatsu, and any
Tekken related forums my screen name is Mini King. If you're from Toronto and you
know Avex, Pascal, or any of the Tekken Crew, then they can tell you who I am.
If I ever come across an establishment with this game, I'll be there playing.
Currently, my source for Tekken 4 has been on Campus Cove at York University.
From time to time, I play Craig Marduk as well.

I don't have internet access at home during the summer, so you may not get any
replies right away.

Remember, reading every FAQ will not substitute for experience. So go out there and play.
