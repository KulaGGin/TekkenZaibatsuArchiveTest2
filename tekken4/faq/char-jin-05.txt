INTRODUCTION
============

--------
TEKKEN 4
--------

The time Tekken:4 came out I was not immediately impressed. For me
there is nothing new in it.But all that is changed now. I saw new 
intricacies in the game that add to that Tekken feel.There is always 
something new in every sequel of Tekken series. Namco has done a great 
job.

----------
JIN KAZAMA
----------

One of the greatest change, in my opinion, is that Jin no longer using 
the classic mishima style of fighting. I think that too much fighter 
using the relatively same style is really a drag. The sudden changeup
of Jin style gives me inspiration to use him, plus the fact that I am 
with equal footing against other new Jin players because of the new 
style.

Many folks in the forum is saying that Jin is overpowering, not true. 
Many say that with Jin you only have to learn few moves, it is wrong. 
Then again there are some who says that they tried using Jin, followed 
the so called few moves to learn and yet they cannot win consistently, 
they are naive.

Jin is a versatile fighter he can attack(bulldog) and wait(turtle), and 
Jin is one of those fighter that you cannot just mash the button and 
win unlike Christie. With many strengths also comes many weakness. Jin 
was able to cover most play style and yet he is not the strongest in 
any of it. Overcoming this weakness is what separates the good Jin 
player from the scrubby. Being able to shift from one style to the 
other, from one rhythm to the other is the greatest strength of Jin.

----------
THIS GUIDE
----------

This guide is written with the novice in mind. I tried to cover most of 
the gaming style and tricks that I know of. This is not the bible of 
"how-to-play-jin-guide" and it will never be complete. Discovery and 
learning has no boundary. I can only try to be as complete as possible.

This guide is organized mainly in two parts. First is the usual stuffs 
such as stories, conventions and movelist. The second part is composed 
of how to use Jin. And finally my thanks to all who have supported me 
or influenced me.

All information in this guide complies with TekkenZaibatsu standards.

Without furthur ado, here we go...

STORIES

For your reading pleasure.....

--------
TEKKEN 4
--------

Two years ago, Heihachi failed to capture Ogre. 

Not willing to give up, Heihachi ordered his researchers to collect 
blood samples, skin tissue,and hoof fragments left behind by Ogre (or 
known as True Ogre in its true manifestation) in order to conduct 
genetic experiments. Heihachi’s goal was to create a new life form by 
splicing Ogre’s genome with his own. However, the research was 
unsuccessful.

After extensive experimentation, Heihachi’s bioengineers came to the 
conclusion that an additional gene - the Devil Gene - was necessary in 
order to successfully splice Ogre’s genetic code into another living 
organism. Heihachi learned that hisown genome lacked the Devil Gene, 
but he knew someone who did...

Jin Kazama.

Jin, who vanquished Ogre in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, was 
shot and mortally wounded by Heihachi. As his life slipped away, Jin 
transformed into a Devil. Upon his transformation, he struck down 
Heihachi and took flight.

Jin’s whereabouts were unknown after the Tournament.

Heihachi searched for Jin to no avail. However, Heihachi discovered a 
photograph during his investigation that stirred his curiosity. The 20-
year-old photograph was an image of a burnt corpse covered with 
laceration wounds. Heihachi paid particular attention to the corpse’s 
back,which had what looked like deformed, protruding wing-like limbs.

Convinced that the picture was of Kazuya, his own son whom he threw 
into a volcano 20 years ago, Heihachi diverted all his resources into 
a search for the body. This search eventually led Heihachi to G 
Corporation, a leading-edge biotech firm making unprecedented advances 
in the field of biogenetics research. 

Heihachi discovered that G Corporation found the corpse and extracted 
and analyzed its genetic data. In fact, Heihachi learned that the 
company was in the midst of creating a new life form by using the data. 
Heihachi also determined that Kazuya’s remains and research data were 
secured at G Corporation’s Nebraska and Nepal research laboratories, 
respectively.

Friday, 25 December. The Tekken Force raided G Corporation’s maximum 
security research laboratory in Nepal. The bottom floors of the 
building were obliterated, and the remaining data storage facility 
containing file servers was airlifted by a group of heavy-duty 
helicopters.

At the same time, a separate unit led by Heihachi infiltrated the 
underground research facility in Nebraska, where Kazuya’s remains were 
preserved. As Heihachi observed from his helicopter, he soon realized 
that unlike the Nepal facility, the operations in Nebraska were not 
going according to plan. The tactical status monitor screens showed the 
first wave of the Tekken Force troops being blown out from the storage 
room where Kazuya’s remains were supposedly kept.

A silhouette of a large figure slowly emerged from the room... When 
Heihachi could see clearly enough, he instantly recognized the large 
figure as Kazuya.

Kazuya was resurrected in G Corporation’s research facility. After his 
resurrection, Kazuya offered his body as research material to determine 
the true nature of the Devil that resided within him. Kazuya’s goal was 
to unify his two selves into one. Kazuya theorized that if he unified 
his body with the Devil, he would be able to truly harness its powers. 
He could then finally take revenge against Heihachi and the Mishima 
Zaibatsu (Financial Empire).

Enraged that Heihachi thwarted his plans, Kazuya obliterated the
heavily armed Tekken Force and vanished into the flames of the lab’s 
wreckage. 

Heihachi was infuriated by Kazuya’s escape and took out his anger on 
his hapless subordinates who reported the escape.

Abel, Heihachi’s lead scientific advisor, urged the enraged Heihachi to 
quickly find a way to capture Kazuya. Once his anger subsided, Heihachi 
focused his mind and decided on a plan. An evil smile crept upon his 
lips.

Two years had passed since The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3.

The Mishima Zaibatsu announced The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 and 
placed the massive financial empire as the top prize.

The champion who manages to defeat Heihachi at the end of the 
Tournament would inherit the Mishima Zaibatsu.

Well aware that the tournament is just a trap designed to lure him out, 
Kazuya nevertheless enters - it is his chance to defeat Heihachi.

JIN KAZAMA
----------

Brisbane, Australia... a city crowded with buildings, new and old. 
Nestled amongst the towering buildings of this city was a small dojo. A 
young man trained there, his face covered by the hood of his jacket. 
This young man trained there quietly...... 

The young man was Jin.

Day after day, Jin trained in the traditional art of karate. Ever since 
Heihachi's betrayal, Jin loathed everything about himself - his Mishima 
bloodline, his fighting style, the Devil gene in his blood, everything. 
He unlearned the Mishima-ryu fighting style thanks to the dojo master's 
training and mastered traditional karate.

Jin's thoughts burned with the desire to destroy the evil Mishima 
bloodline - the bloodline of his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima, and his 
father, Kazuya.

One day, Jin heard rumors that The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 was 
announced.

A once in a lifetime opportunity to exterminate the Mishima clan... 
Without hesitation, Jin hardened his resolve to enter the tournament.

Jin hit a sandbag with his sharply honed kick. The bag burst open 
violently, and sand poured out of the bag...

==========
FRAME DATA
==========

I put up this frame data section with furthur studying in mind. A 
novice will eventually learn more than this guide could ever teach. 
Putting up a frame table here, I believe, will make this info more 
handy.

Conventions are already part of this guide, you should familiarize 
yourself with that because without it you will be looking at gibeerish 
all thru out this guide.

What frame table really tells you is how fast a move hits after you tap 
the button. Tekken runs in 60 frames per second so a 10 frame move 
takes at least 1/6 of a second before hitting. Also bear in mind that 
frame data is not absolute, you must also consider if your opponent is 
pushed afterwards.

This data may be wrong in some point (considering typing all that 
numbers). The point here is it will give you a clear idea of what is 
safe and what is not. The frame data that is about to be shown is 
exclusively for Jin. For others' frame data refer to the TZ.

Command Column          (command)

Pretty self explanatory, this is how you execute the listed move. The 
directions are in relation to which way your character is facing of 
course.
 
Hit Column              (hit)

Indicates how many frames it takes for a move to hit after you have 
finished the command. This does not included the number of frames it 
takes to input the command.
 
Block Adv Column        (b adv)

The number of frame advantage or disadvantage when the move is blocked. 
Meaning the amount of frames it takes before you can input a new 
command. Positive numbers are advantages over your opponent, negative 
numbers indicate a disadvantage and KD indicates the opponent gets 
knocked down. This can either be a juggle, stun or any other kind of 
knock down.
 
Hit Adv Column          (h adv)

The number of frame advantage or disadvantage on a hit. Keep in mind a 
hit does not necessarily results in an advantage over the opponent. 
Frame advantage on stagger moves reflects the amount of stagger frames, 
this does not equal the number of frames your opponent cannot block 
attacks.
 
Crouch Hit Adv Column   (crouch h adv)

The number of frame advantage or disadvantage on a hit when the 
opponent is in a crouched position. Frame advantage on stagger moves 
reflects the amount of stagger frames, this does not equal the number 
of frames your opponent cannot block attacks.
 
Counter Hit Adv Column  (CH adv)

The number of frame advantage or disadvantage on a counter hit. Keep in 
mind a counter hit does not necessarily results in an advantage over 
the opponent.
 
Escape Adv Column       (escape adv)

Applies to Grappling Arts only. This shows the number of frame 
advantage or disadvantage you have after your opponent escapes the 
throw in question. Usually results in 0 or a slight disadvantage.

------
POKING
------

Simply put, poking is attacking in the hopes to draw a response from 
the opponent to facilitate stringing or simply to interrupt their own 
strings. Basically this are single attacks which is fast and gives up 
low damage. Don't shun this tactics when I said low damage, you will 
see that you will hit your opponent many times always adding up that 
low damage that just might win you that game.


*REGULAR POKE*

1

This is my prefered jab. Simple jab nothing fancy, where this thing 
shines is it gives you 2 frames when blocked, just enough for your 
strings to come out. Use this often as a setup for what you have in 
mind.

2

Just like the first jab. Why I put this here is for two reason. First. 
This jab does not give you frame advantage. Second. I wanna emphasize 
that if ever you are used to using 2, practice using 1 instead.

1,2

A string poke. If you are using 1 and connects often, it won't hurt to 
add that 2 for additional damage. I am so used to using only 1 as a 
poke. I realized that I'm wasting opportunity to tick the life bar of 
my enemy. I only got used to doing 1,2 when I was using Kaz. 

2,4

If you cannot get used to using 1 as a jab, then make your using 2 
worthwhile. This move is guaranteed if 2 hits. Good for poking, 
rounding up your strings and as a punishing move.

3_4

I really don't like using this. Since the kicks hits high it is the 
same as the jabs. Use the jab instead, because you got more options 
after the jabs, unlike the kicks.

d/f+2

Juggles on counter hit. The technique for this move is not to throw it 
immidiately, Throw this if you see your opponent just far enough not to 
be reached by the simple 1, but in range enough to be hit by any other 
long moves. The thing is most opponent instinctively attacks if they 
are on this range making your chance for the counter hit a little more 
probable. Doing this move on complete close range will spell disaster 
for you with a capital D!

*LOW POKES*

d/b+1

8 frames fast. In case you don't know this is a universal interruptor. 
If ever you find yourself being hit by single attacks then throw this 
one up to stop them on their tracks. 

d/b+2

Refrain from using this one. This gives your opponent frames upon block
and is slower. Use d/b+1 instead.

d/b+3

A regular low kick. Can hit grounded opponent. The thing here is that 
this thing is slow. The next one is a better alternative.

d/b+4

A faster version of the one above. A nice continuation for the low jab.
Also this one is repeatable for example: d/b+1,(hold d/b)4,(hold d/b)4. 
Heck you can even go on forever if your opponent keeps coming at you.

d+4

Hits low, decent damage. Use this to finish off the last few life of 
your opponent. Sometimes you can do this repeatedly, against a panicky 
opponent. I read this strat from a guide somewhere but can't remember 
where, thanks to you.

Low poke is very essential because this will give you that extra damage 
that just might give you the game. Inserting low pokes in your strings 
is a very good way to go, since this will vary your hit range thus 
giving your opponent somemore to think about.

If your opponent is attackaholic and you are blockaholic then stop from 
blocking. Retaliate d/b+1 instead, it is prefered because it is a 
spirited defense. You don't just block and let your opponent dictate 
the gameflow this is what this low poke is for. Another thing if you 
manage to hit with the low jab you can refrain from standing at once 
by doing another lowpoke the prefered method is you hit with d/b+1,
(hold d/b)4, You will see that you will stop even the best Hwoarang 
with your lowpokes.


*WHILE STANDING MOVES*

This section goes hand in hand with the low pokes. After doing a low 
poke move just by releasing the stick  will put you on while standing 
position. Low pokes has a tendency of recovering slow so be careful. 
I think knowing a few while standing moves will put you on good 
position after a low poke. WS moves has a tricky distance range so 
practice these moves and feel their range for yourself. They have a 
long recovery time if you missed them, so don't miss these moves.

WS+2

A single strike that hits upto mid-distance. Good if your opponent 
thinks that he is safe from attack from that range. Also this moves 
launches the opponent for a juggling opportunity. This move could hit 
fast if done on iWS compare to the after low poke version.

WS+1,2

A very nice move if you just want to go on stringing some more. I 
believe that it has faster recovery so you can go on pressuring some 
more. One of my favourite continuation after low poke.

WS+4

Basically a mix-up for your low poke game, If your opponent expects 
another low poke especially the d/b+4 follow up. This is nice because 
it hits mid and if the opponent blocks low for an extra long while then 
you might want to use this instead. Also this is relatively safer if 
blocked because it pushes your opponent giving you time to defend.

WS+3

A much more powerful kick out of WS. The downside here is that it hits 
high. Best done if you are certain enough that it will hit. If not 
stick to WS+4 , it is safer and faster.

You should know when to back off from WS moves. Sometimes it gets 
predictable and tends to miss a lot and get punished. Like I said 
before practice their ranges see for yourself. If this moves are done
right it can give you magnificent end results.

*WS AS A POKE*

As much as possible, you should do WS moves out of low pokes. But there 
cases that you can really anticipate an opponent's move and you can hit 
him with a WS moves. Here are the ways you can go into WS.

iWS

Done by tapping d,d/b,N or d,d/f,N . This is the standard way of going 
into WS without low poking. This may get a little while to learn. But 
as you gain mastery you'll see that this has more use than what it looks.

WS deftones14 method

I picked this one up from the liquid hwoarang guide. The method here 
has the same idea as the iWS. The main differences is it makes the 
motion easier and skips the animation of ducking. This is done by 
holding D/B. As you anticipate that you are going to crouch release the 
stick( go N ) and there you go, WS sequence.

CD cancel to WS

Basically the use for this is to close in and hit with a WS move. Done
by doing CD,d/b,N The CD part will close you into your opponent. By 
tapping d/b you cancel your CD into plain crouch. Going N will put you 
finally on WS sequence. 

Thanks to Triple Lei and deftones14! I got more out of the Hwoarang 
guide than just Hwoarang strategies.

---------
STRINGING
---------

Basically stringing is poking done in batches. I separated them for the 
reason that no matter how similar they are their still different in 
their own way. Stringing requires more skill, intuition and guts while 
poking is to fascilitate the stringing, I guess you can call poking a 
setup.

*TWIN THRUST SERIES*

1,2,3_4

1,2 - a fast double jabs. If you anticipated that your opponent will 
approach with a move and you interrupt with 1, I guess doing 1,2 is 
better. I think if 1 connects then 2 is guaranteed. So practice using 
this, this series is the main point of why Jin is being used widely.

3 - Finishing  with this is much more preferred by many. This move is 
sweet because the 3 part gives you frames upon block so big even when 
blocked that you can do it again and again and again.....this is a good 
setup for whatever you like, like throwing and shifting to laser 
series. Also a guaranteed stuff is if ever this move hits you can do 
d+4 for a free additional damage. This thing juggles too on hit.

4 - Not a very good string if done all alone. You can use it as a 
drawing move, try this on for size. First do 1,2,4 don't worry if it is 
blocked it is meant to be, you see after 4 your opponent will be pushed 
far enough for him to be given a window for retaliation, again don't 
worry it is meant to be. Then as you anticipate his attack throw a 
d+3+4 for a juggle, a CH. 

Why this thing is good is not only bacause of the 1,2,3 part but as a 
whole. If done and thrown wisely this moves will give you that extra 
damage that you need to win the game. Also don't trap yourself in doing 
the whole string, you can do it like this 1,1,2,1,2,3. Well that combo 
is good only to an extent but the point is, mix them up.

*LANCER SERIES*

2,1,4_4~4
d/f+1,4_4~4

2,1 - This is my personal favourite series. It is relatively safe 
compare to 1,2 since it hits high and mid. Use this alternately with 
1,2 for better results. The use of this move is just the  same as you 
would use 1,2 . Best for crouchers and steve's weave.

d/f+1 - this puts you directly to the 1 part of 2,1. this is good for 
continous pressure on the mid-section. For example 2,1,d/f+1,4 , this 
series hits the mid-section three times subconciously telling your 
opponent that he can't crouch. Then you can throw him, or something 
like that...

4 - As I mentioned earlier finishing with this move pressures the 
mid-section. If ever you've been using 2,1 for a while, throwing this 
part in may just surprise your opponent. Another use for this move is 
for breathing space if 4 is blocked then a single back dash will put 
you out of most attacks' range, remember I said most not all.

4~4 - This is the mix-up of the combo above where it hits low. Dish 
this one out occasionaly and  it could give you results. Now the reason 
why most guides or faqs shuns this move is that it could get 
predictable in time, has a slow recovery and finally could be 
interrupted by most jabs. So simply put, don't abuse this move. If ever 
your opponent can't block the shin kick then use this but if he 
starts to block it then stop using it.

*LASER SERIES*

b,f+2,1
 =2
 =d+2
 =d+2*
 =:d+2

This is the same as his old move dating back upto T:3. altough it 
retains its' looks it no longer has the same properties, meaning 
useless for juggles. When it comes to damage and execusion then it is 
the same.

b,f+2,1,2_d+2 - Well many guides has been already written about this 
and many players can already use this move instinctively, for the sake 
of the beginners here I go... The first part consisting of the first 
two hits that hits mid. Finishing this move with the 2 gives you normal 
mid hitting attack. If blocked this can give you with good breathing 
space. Finishing with d+2 juggles the opponent. Beware that unlike the 
normal 2, when d+2 is blocked your whacked! So just be careful. Also 
works wonders on rolling opponent.


d+2* - Now this is new. Holding down the last commands makes the 
juggling uppercut unblockable!Now don't get to excited, This move has 
major start-up time. Only works for beginners or simply you shocked 
your opponent. Overall this is not bad, see if this move works on your 
opponent otherwise STOP! Use the one below instead.

:d+2 - Now if you notice the move above makes a charging animations 
before the unblockable part comes out. This move puts you in the 
earliest stage of the charge-up just enough for it to be unblockable 
but not long enough for it to be predictive. The timing of this is hard 
to put on paper lucky for us there is CATLORD. Download the Jin video 
to see the proper timing, at TZ and catlord.com. 

Remember, you don't have to finish all of it. Be imaginative on how to 
finish this string. My suggestions are: Go on low poking, throw or just 
changeup and go on stringing.

To be an effective stringer, you must not hesitate to do them. Every 
small moment that you stop to think gives your opponent frame gain. The 
trick here is practice a series of strings so that you don't have to 
think about it, giving your opponent less time to counter attack. As 
you progress you can learn another series adding up on what you know. 
This way you are acting on instinct rather on thinking.

*FINISHING THE STRINGS*

Rounding up your combo is very important in Jin's play. Unlike Hwoarang 
you can't go on forever on stringing or else it will get predictable 
and get punished. This section will give good moves that you can use. 

d+1

This I use a lot since it ducks most high moves. If your opponent is 
enthusiastic about his high attacks then round up your strings with 
this. Also a Good punishing move for missed attacks that has slow 
recovery.

2,4

Simply a good finishing string. Where this thing shines is that when 
the 2 hits the following 4 is guaranteed. Just beware this hits both 
high.

d+4

Well this is your friendly low sweep, its' utilities ranges from poking 
to okizeme, SWEET! A very simple move not much damage but it gets the 
job done. For mix-up purposes use this rather than just always using a 
high or mid hitting finisher. REMEMBER.. mix it up!

d/f+4 

Well I not recommend you to use this a lot since it is slow and has no 
evasive properties, but I didn't told you to shun this move either. For 
what it lacks it makes up for its' damage, nothing could deal better 
damage.

d+3,3

Between slow and fast this move is in the middle. The juice is that it 
hits low then mid, so if ever your opponent ducks extensively then this 
is the move to throw out. Also I believe this move pushes your opponent 
even if blocked, meaning you can start your stringing all over again! 
Best as a finisher after 1,2,3 , hitting in different ranges, more to 
think about for your opponent.

1+2

Both hits high. A good alternative for the 2,4. This move gives more 
damage. It is a power shot so if you see a wall behind your opponent 
dish this one out.

Throws - Haha may sound cheap but when playing Jin you know you must 
use this. I experienced once that no matter how I string the hell off 
my opponent I can't hit them for they mastered the art of blocking. So 
I asked one of my friend how could I overcome this problem then he said 
simply "throw him", and so I did. It worked like magic. If mixedup with 
all the finishing moves your throw will be invincible even if it just 
the regular 2+4.

Finishing a string doesn't mean that you should actually stop. The stop 
that I mean here is that to prevent a missing hit ( a part of the 
string that doesn't hit). Missing hits in your strings  is very bad for 
many reasons. First, the frames advantage that you gain from the 
strings which makes it a string is lost because your attack missed, 
second this diminished frame advantage means disaster because it gives 
your opponent a window of opportunity to retaliate. Simply after you 
finish your strings go into your opponent's face and start another one. 
This tactic of finishing of strings is just like all the periods in 
this guide that ends a sentence which in turn put altoghether to make 
a pharagraph. This is the analogy of Jin's string arts.

--------
JUGGLING
--------

Juggling has been an integral part of Tekken since time immemorial. It 
is good bacause it give you the opportunity to deal as much damage has 
you can without the hassles of missing, blocking reversals and all 
that. So it is a must that you know how to juggle. In my opinion 
juggling is not just juggling. You must first learn how to launch your 
opponent then hit them in the air. These are the two major parts that 
you should know and learn well.

*LAUNCHERS*

Of course you cannot juggle if your opponent is on the ground, you'll 
be stringing him then. To juggle you must first launch them (duh!). So 
here are launching moves and how to use them. Ching!

d/f+2

Only juggles on counterhit. I've already explained how to use this move 
so just read back in case you've forgotten.

WS+2

Now, there is a familiar thing. This move is used abusively in TTT. 
Sometimes you will discover that your low poke doesn't connect even if 
it is 8 frames. So how you remedy this? Simply just crouch and don't 
jab, the moment your opponent's move missed release the stick and hit 
2 and voila! instant juggle guaranteed damage.

d+3+4

Jin had this move for a long time but it is not until tekken 4 that it 
is widely used. Two jump kicks that hits mid. You can hit rolling 
opponent with this. A liitle slow startup though. So you will see the 
properness of this move when we get to movements.

Laser Series d+2 variations - just like old times, this is second to 
wind god fist back then. Although this time, in my opinion, it is a 
little bit weaker. It doesn't juggle, side stepping it is much more 
easier. So for me this is the last launcher that you should use.

*JUGGLES*

Now that you got your opponent into the air then you got to hit him. I 
am not really into fancy juggles so I'll just list the ones that I use
the most. I like this a lot because "I get the most with the least", 
simplicity and effectiveness is the keyword. 

1,2,3,d+4

The 1,2,3 probably the most repeated move in a match with Jin in it. It
has many utilities such as setups and yes, Juggles! So, if you hit your
opponent successfully with the 1,2,3 then follow up with d+4 another
guaranteed to hit. 

1,2,4

Not as much pwerful as the earlier variation. The thing that made me 
list this down is it's extra damage when the wall is at the back of the 
opponent. Hitting opponent with this will cause wall stun and your d+4 
is guaranteed with the added bonus of the wall hit damage. Use this on 
event that the wall is visible and you know that your opponent will hit 
them, otherwise stick to the first juggle. Because of the wall you can
go into okizeme after.

You can also put a 1 before all this, for example, 1,1,2,3,d+4. 
Sometimes you will see that you cannot connect them all, the problem 
lies in your distance range. The remedy is dash forward after 
launching, hit, dash, hit. There you go all moves connected. Getting 
the most with the least.

If your into flashy juggles just download a video or read other guides 
that shows you this. I'm just showing the simplest ones.

*FLOATING*

There will be time that you will see your opponent flying around like 
you hit them with launching moves even if you didn't. This event is 
called floating. You see sometimes you hit your opponent while doing 
a move which we regularly calls freefloating moves. Good examples of 
this are Yoshi's flea stance and King's moonsault press. Plus the rule
to true floating is hitting them while they are stunned, may it be 
being walled or stun hitted.

Jin's main arsenal when it come to floating is the everlasting 1(what 
more could you ask for a measly jab?).When you see this happen 
juggle them immidiately use 1,2,3,d+4 right away. This is important 
because it gives you another edge, damage wise. My main advice about 
this is always be on the alert when you use 1 because this the main 
arsenal of Jin when it comes to floating, you may hit your opponent
without seeing that he did a freefloating move.

*SPECIAL FLOAT JUGGLE*

I called this special because this is the part where you can actually 
force a float into your opponent. Here are the float inducing moves.

1,2,3

Aha! another utility for that pesky 1,2,3(altough the 3 part must 
connect in order for this to work). This maybe a little wierd because 
the d/f+(1_2) part will not always connect which is used as a 
stabilizer for the combo. I believe you must be in complete close range 
to be able to hit your opponent.

f,f+3,1

The f,f+3 works just like the 3 of the 1,2,3.The main difference is 
after f,f+3 you tap 1, a guaranteed jab if the f,f+3 hits. Just be 
careful, altough it is an axekick it comes out slower considering the 
tapping time it would take you.

Here are the followups...

Starter: f,f+3 or 1,2,3
Combos:
d/f+1,1,f,f+2
d/f+1,1,2,f,f+2
d/f+1,1,3~3,d+4 (recommended)
d/f+1,4         (recommended)
d/f+2,1,3~3,d+4 (recommended) 
d/f+2,2,4       (recommended)

Starter: f,f+3,1
Combo:
1,1,d+1
1,1,f,f+2
1,1,3~3,d+4
1,2,4
1,2,3,d+4

Thanks goes to the TZ. Their movelist gave me the idea that this 
strategy actually works.

----
STUN
----

I got this idea only after playing Kazuya, and I knew that Jin has a 
pseudo-stun combo. The only let down here is that it is not as powerful 
as Kazuya's. Here are the stunners.

f+4

Note that just like Kazuya's, this need to be a CH to be a stun.

b,f+2

Just like the move above this needs a CH to be a stun. This is the 
preferred stun because it give bigger damage and of course the double 
over stun.

Here are the follow ups...

Starter: f+4 CH 
Combos: 
4~3
d+3+4
f+4
f,f+4

Starter: b,f+2 CH
Combo:
1+2
4~3

Again thanks to TZ.

-----------
WALL SYSTEM
-----------

With the integration of wall in tekken 4, it gave the game another 
twist. Hitting you opponent into one gives extra damage, depending on 
what move hit them before they hit the wall. The stronger the move the 
bigger the wall damage(I think, hehe!).

*STUN*

Basically there two type of stuns. One, regular stuns, this are moves 
that gives you a small window of opportunity to attack with a 
guaranteed hit. This events are usually fast in animation, usually 
this are pre-meditated meaning you got a hunch that they will be 
stunned. Second, power wall stun, this has a longer stun animation 
meaning you can do a lot. Few examples of what you can do are hitting 
them with another power shot, juggle them and float juggle them.

*REGULAR WALL STUN*

When your oppopnent back is directly against the wall any move will 
basically induce a regular stun(in the light that you hit them). This 
give you an opportunity to start another strings or just throw them. 
Since the animation is fast it takes practice.

The position change throw command is another effective way of inducing 
a stun. This is especially useful in situations when you are the one 
which is about to be stunned, so grab your opponent and push them into 
walls to turn the tides.

*POWER WALL STUN*

Now this is the meat of the wall system. I am not particularly sure of 
how the computer calculate the damages you get from wall but the thing 
I know is what moves induces power wall stuns.

d+1
d/f+4
f,f+2

I also refer to these moves as power shots since it gives big damage 
and a knockdown. If your opponent is against the wall the knockdown 
part is changed into power wall stun. You will also see that these 
moves are string enders so this moves is particularly used as enders 
when you see a wall behind your opponent's back.

What you do after this strong stun is upto your liking. If you are 
brutal then power shot them.If you can't satisfy your fingers then 
juggle and float juggle them. Whatever you like.

-------
OKIZEME
-------

Okizeme also known as oki. This is a technique that deals with grounded 
opponent preventing them from getting up and recovering effectively. 
Again lucky for Jin he has some good oki moves, But unlike Xiaoyou and 
Julia Jin's oki game is mediocre.

*PLAYING DEAD*

Most players especially those on the know how, will usually remain 
lying after knockdown. The reason for this is that most oki moves 
especially those coming from Julia relies heavily on opponent trying 
to get up. Fortunately for us we are Jin user and we got a little bit 
of everything.

d+4

No longer just a juggle ender. You see even if your opponent doesn't 
move you can hit them with this. It is more like a punishing move for 
those playing dead. Remember that you can hit them as many time as your 
heart desires.

3~4

Mainly used just like the d+4. The downside is that a side rolling 
opponent will certainly dodge this. The bad thing about this being 
missed is that it reverses the position. You will end up lying and your 
opponent standing, thus your oki game is lost. What saves this move 
from being trash is its' damage, a single hit even on lying opponent 
consumes chunk of damage. So much more easier than a repeated d+4. 
Defenitely not a move for all those playing safe.

f+4

This requires special attention. The thing is it is a little bit slower 
than d+4 and it is linear meaning a siderolling opponent will evade 
this and hit you with a sweep. Use this move if your opponent is 
sandwiched between you and the wall.

d+3+4

An oki move that is only used for a very specific reason. When your 
opponent is down near a wall. You get much damage, plus you may get the 
opportunity for a multiple wall hits. But there is a rule here, you can 
only hit your opponent once after they fall down, after that your kicks
will completely miss. To reset this after you hit d+3+4 do the d+4 then 
repeat. This is mainly done to those who is stubborn and wants to lay 
down indefinitely. Advisably use this if opponent commits a mistake of 
rolling backwards towrds the wall.

*ROLLING*

Well most fighters need to roll to get up, in this case you can hit 
them with mid hitting moves. This is one of the most abused oki style 
and yet the most neglected in some way so let me show you the why and 
how.

Basically any mid hitting move will probably hit a rolling opponent, 
such as power shots and the regular oki move. The effective way on 
throwing this is to time it right, there are certain parts of the 
rolling animation that your opponent is completely vulnerable. You must 
be able to time your move in such a way that it hits exactly at this 
moment. This thing cannot be taught in mere writing, it needs to be 
practiced and felt. All I can do is point this part out.

Hitting a rolling opponent with power shots is much more effective if 
they are rolling towards a wall. Extra damage is always good.

In a lying opponent there are two parts in it. First, there is the 
lying position then there is the part where they are getting up. The 
first part is playing dead position the next one is the rolling 
animation. Being able to hit your opponent cleanly while rolling will 
put them back to playing dead position, in which they have to roll 
again to get up. You see the pattern here could be endless this is 
the part which you should learn when it comes to okizeme because this 
is the process the okizeme expert will exploit.

Then there is the tech roll and the quick getup. The tech roll is 
accomplished by pressing either any kick or punch the moment you hit 
the ground. The purpose of this is that it minimizes the play dead 
and rolling sequence of a fighter. You should watch out for this 
because you could get punished if you expected your opponent not 
tech rolling. The next thing in line is the quick getup. This is 
done by tapping forward as you hit the ground. This is different 
from the tech roll because of the fact that you skip the whole play
dead and rolling sequence and it puts you in a standing position. 
The getup animation will also damage a nearby opponent, not much 
damage but it will. A constant change up with tech roll and quick 
getup will put you, most of the time, out of harms way.

Ultimately to be good at okizeme you must train since there is no 
strings in it. Also keep in mind that you don't have to be flashy, if 
all this rolling thing and playing dead is too much,you can simply hit 
your opponent with d+4 repeatedly. This of course is regular way of 
doing it, it won't give bigger damage or anything but it is effective. 
A grounded opponent no matter what position they are in will always get 
hit by a mere d+4.

--------
GROUNDED
--------

This may already a common knowledge for all those who is playing tekken 
for a while now, but I would still like to add my thoughts in it. 
Grounded means that you are the one who is lying.Since it is seldom in 
a fight that you do not fall on your back, then this techniques will to
be invaluable.

When grounded you can press any of this:

4_3
1+2
f_b
b+3+4

f_b - These are basic roll towards / roll away respectively. In earlier 
section I already discussed the danger of these rolling moves. You can 
really get hit seriously while doing these but it has its' purpose. 
Against a scared opponent try rolling in, to minimize walking distance
. To get space roll out. Apart from moving you will later see more 
purpose for this roll thing.

1+2 - Flying cross chop - This thing hits mid. The potential of this 
move is if combined with the proper mixup and of course after a roll. 
If ever you roll out and the opponent follows surprise them by pressing 
1+2 and you immidiately go to flying cross chop.

b+3+4 - Rising kickup - I believe this move hits high and cannot be 
combined with rolling. The only purpose of this move is for surprise. 
If you are grounded and the opponent closes in right away, then you 
have no time for rolling, this move is your best alternative.

4_3 - The 4 is a rising kick to the mid and the 3 is a low sweep, both 
these move will knock down an opponent on clean hit. Since these moves 
can be combined with rolling, you can play a mind game. If your 
opponent is near, hit low. If he started to block the sweep hit him 
mid. Just mix these two up together with rolling and it will be enough 
to give you a good grounded game.

So now you will think, if there is the rolling and rising kicks mixup 
then what is flying cross chop and rising kick up is for? Really? This 
is your answer, the cross chop and rising kickup is for covering a 
small distance that the 3_4 cannot usually reach. Some opponent will 
draw you to use this moves, beware of this. What they are actually 
trying to do is let you think you can hit them but actually they know 
what you will do and they want you to do it. These moves has a high 
recovery time so if ever you miss to hit your opponent you will get 
whacked.

The usual method and the most effective way to do this drawing move is 
when you are knocked down the opponent will rush in, so you think you 
can hit them you pressed 1+2. Then your opponent anticipating you doing 
the flying crosschop,SS rightaway and you miss and you get punished. 
Another way is dash in then walk back, this is done by f,f to start the 
running animation but stop there then tap b,b then hold. This will make 
you see and think that he will go all the way in but he really 
intend to back out. You do the cross chop, you miss, you get punished. 
The key here is when you are caught one time don't do it again just 
stand up by a simple roll away. Now you know how they do it then do it 
to them.

---------
MOVEMENTS
---------

These is probably what made me in love with tekken in the first place. 
The wide range of movements is what sets tekken apart from other 
fighting game and this is one of the most earliest game system that is 
put into tekken. With it being a game system it is worth giving it
a little run thru.

SS - sidestep - done by tapping u_d. This moves you to the side of your 
opponent putting him out of  axis. By doing this move you are changing 
your line of sight making the line of sight of your opponent wrong 
therefore he cannot hit you. Instead of blocking do this move instead 
it will put you on a better counter attacking position and puts you out 
of frame disadvantage.Also by holding the stick to the direction where 
you SS will put you into walking sideways continously.

CD - crouchdash - done by f,N,d,d/f. For me this is the trademark of a 
mishima. The primary purpose of this move is to dash in while in a 
crouch position, also it is used for covering long distances in a 
relatively safe manner. For a mishima this move has other purposes, for 
attack. You can also do this in quick succession, f,N,d,d/f,f,f,N,d,d/f
...and so on and so on. What happens here is you do CD then cancel it 
by tapping f then do another CD.

Basically Jin has no stances or any move that will allow you to do 
those fox step or triple SS.Just master the basic SS as a means to 
dodge a move and it is enough to give you profound results. Really I 
don't know about the foxstep part but I guess if you don't understand 
something leave it, you will be better off.

*DRAW STEP*

I invented the name, so what, I did this for ease of explanation. This 
is done by tapping f,f,b,b. What happens here is that it shows your 
intention to attack,that is the f,f part. At b,b you are moving away 
from the reaction of your opponent which is his counter attack to your 
illusion of attack. After that you are free to counter attack him.

*SHORT DRAW STEP*

Basically the same as the draw step only you do this by f,b,b. This is 
a mixup for your draw step. If you are always doing the full version 
your opponent may be able to catch on and hit you during your f,f. By 
cutting your step short you are evading his attack in a much more 
shorter time during the b,b part.

*DODGE STEP*

Another invented name. This is done by tapping f,f,d or b,b,d. 
Actually this is a variation of the draw step, for mixup purposes. 
What is nice about this is that you move out of the axis of your 
opponent making you free from attacks.

*CD CANCEL*

Playing for a while, your friends will catch on and try to wait for you 
to miss your CD+1. In this case do this, CD,b . What happens here is 
that you CD but don't do any CD moves, you are just giving the illusion 
of you doing a CD move. After that you can throw them or do anything in 
accord with how your opponent reacts after your CD cancel.

If your opponent reacts with an attack just SS after the CD cancel. You 
will see that you are now defending actively and be able to hit them 
with whatever you had in mind.

You should practice this moves in such a way that it appears that you 
mean it so it won't appear that you are just bluffing, to arouse the 
response of your opponent. You may not always get the desired effect of 
movements, anyway you should keep on doing it, who knows...you might 
get it. Another thing to remember is that you should keep on moving 
always changing up your pattern of movements, this will make it hard 
for your opponent to calculate correctly your position. This is one way 
on how to get your opponent to commit a mistake, an attack that missed 
because of your movement skills. Overall you want to maintain the 
opponent in CD distance, so you will not be susceptible to attacks and 
making your opponent open for counter CD attack.

*GAME START*

There is this part in tekken where before you start a match, you are
allowed to do any movements which has no damaging properties. This part
is essential because this will give you the general flow of the game.
While on this part you can do the following:

Walk, SS - Simply put, walk towards one side and at the time it says 
fight! you do an SS to the direction you are walking. This is good 
because walking puts you out of your opponents axis.If he is wise 
enough nto move back to put him back on axis then do a SS to put 
back right out.

Jump over, 4 - Time the jump part in such a way wherein when the 
announcer says fight you are directly behind your opponent. Press 4 
then you got your self a free kick. Thanks mini_king.

TEST OF SPIRIT 
==============

Basically this is a novice read thru. As for the expert, you may know 
all of this but I still hope you learn something. There is no end in 
learning.

-------
SUMMARY
-------

When stringing, don't be afraid to do them. Always finish up your 
string to prevent missing hits. Practice mixing them up to prevent 
the opponent from anticipating your next attack. 

Use low pokes and low attacks. Try to guage your opponent of how many 
low attacks you can throw at them. Try to do as much as you can but 
don't use low attacks exclusively.

If your opponent blocks a lot, throw them.

When it comes to juggling keep in mind you want to get free damage in, 
not to get cocky! If you miss a juggling opportunity because you are 
trying to do a fancy juggle, prepare to get punished.

Always try to hit your opponent no matter if he is down, standing or 
whatever. This is tekken not street fighter. Practice your okizeme 
instincts and techniques.

When doing okizeme beware of the moves that your opponent can do, such 
as low sweeps and the flying cross chop. 

When you are being knocked down, as much as possible always tech roll 
or use the quick getup.This will prevent you from staying down for a 
long time, therefore reducing the risk of you being pummeled 
defenseless.

You know what your opponent can do? then do the same to them. Getting 
hit while on ground? them hit them too when they are on the ground. 
Opponent throwing you a lot? throw them too.

Instead of blocking try SS-ing. This will help you from getting a frame 
disadvantage. SS-ing also gives you attacking opportunities. So after 
SS-ing, ATTACK!

Practice movements. Always move a lot. This will make it hard for your 
opponent to guage your distance from them. Hopefully they would commit 
a mistake and you get to punish them.

First practice mechanically. Like how to do string, knowing move 
properties, learning different parts of the game such as okizeme and 
juggles. As you get used to it, practice instinctively. This is the 
part where you synthesize all that you know.

The flow of the game from poking to oki to juggle may shift very 
quickly. Practice in such a way it is instinctive to you of what you 
are in and react accordingly.

Remember to enjoy the game. A win means "I am improved" not "I am the 
best". A lost doesn't mean "I suck" but rather "I need improvement".

------------
THE PRACTICE
------------

Hmmm... Does the title remind you of something? Anyway, practicing 
could be very hard especially if you are playing alone with no one to 
teach you, same as my case.

The thing is practice by parts. This guide is made to do just that. 
Showing part by part. Practice one part as you gain efficiency, move to 
another.

*LEVELS OF LEARNING*

We all started as a beginner, I know I did! We saw someone good 
playing, it captured our attention and started playing. We start to 
look at movelist and stuff. Started playing in the arcades and get 
beaten the hell out of us. The main thing here is how we will move on 
to be good. We are not experts if we can only do one move, it takes a 
little bit more than that.

To be good, we should pay attention upto the minute detail. From moves 
that promotes flow of attack to frame advanatage that we gain from 
simple jabs.

Do not be discouraged because you can't win, remember that your 
opponent is human or is made by human which is subjected to mistake. If 
you are at the bottom the only way left is up. The only one who could 
stop you from learning is yourself.

No Excuse Play Hard Be Tough!

CLOSING REMARKS
===============

Upto this day Tekken still gathers many fans. Continously capturing our 
imagination or plainly as an outlet for our inner frustrations. 
Whatever your reasons for playing always remember that it is just a 
game. The objective is to gain friends not make enemies.


This guide is my labor of love for the game. My aims are for novices to 
improve thier game, advanced players who wants to learn Jin as a new 
fighter and finally for experts to consider some other things they 
might have missed.

University of Santo Tomas (UST).

I've been playing tekken for a long while now, starting from the first 
installment. I never got serious on it until tekken 3 where I started 
to play at arcades and learn some "street-stuffs". I also never gotten 
to join any tourneys because of my studies, academics comes first, 
tekken can't feed me you know. Nonetheless, I am beyond average play. 

If any one is in the vicinity please email me for a friendly match up. 
If you have spotted any errors, either gramatically or strategicaly 
please email me. Also, if I have missed any strats email me of your 
suggestions, I'll be happy to accomodate them and give you credit. You 
can reach me at louvenel@tekken.cc please don't be an asshole when 
emailing me, it is alright to criticize me but at least put it in a
