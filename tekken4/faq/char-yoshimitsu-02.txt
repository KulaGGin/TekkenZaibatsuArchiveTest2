            === This Guide must be viewed in monotype typeface! ===

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This FAQ was originally written for the following sites:

1. http://yoshimitsu.prv.pl  [ or: http://yoshimitsu.rules.it ]
2. http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com

For TekkenZaibatsu it's the Final Version. The FAQ will be updated only in
the Yoshimitsu Obsession Team Shrine [http://yoshimitsu.prv.pl] if I find
anything interesting to add. 

Please check the sites above.
If you have found this guide on the site not listed above, and the list of 
sites differs in the original FAQ [ located at http://yoshimitsu.prv.pl ], 
please let me know. It means of course that somebody uses my [ hard ] work 
for his/her own profits. 

Also, if you want to put your FAQ on your site, you can let me know. I will 
change the list of sites above and you'll be an "official" FAQ distributor :)
Of course I don't have to mention that the contents of this FAQ must remain
untouched...

Eventually, you can put a link to this page:
http://yoshimitsu.gamingsource.co.uk/faqfiles1.php
Here's located the FAQ. But DON'T put the original FAQ text on your own site! 

Moreover, the strategies below are copyright (c) Tenshimitsu [ unless I say 
otherwise ], and you should NOT steal the information contained in this guide 
or attempt to reword it. A lot of FAQs/Guides/etc. have been ripped, 
redistributed or reworded, especially by magazines... just don't do it. The 
consequences of such a deed would be very painful for you and also unforgiven 
by the Tekken community... Keep it in mind. 
Not to mention it will only make you look like a moron. Simple. Sit in the 
chair, spend hundreds hours playing Tekken and write your own FAQ, do not
steal somebody's work. It's disgusting!

==============================================================================

- 01.02.2004 - VERSION 1.0! - After over three months of writing, I finally
             finished this FAQ... I wrote it mainly during weekends, having
             no time in the middle of the week due to studies... heh heh, 
             I finished it a minute before midnight. :P What I'm writing here

= [1] :: Prologue ::
==============================================================================

Hello Yoshi lovers! My name's Joanna Torz (yeah, I'm a girl... but... stop! 
Please! Don't close this FAQ! Give me a chance! :P ] and I'm from Poland. 
Some of you may know me as Tenshimitsu [from http://yoshimitsu.prv.pl site], 
in Tekken Zaibatsu forums my nickname is "Kazu-Yoshi-girl" [very old one :)].
Here's my first attempt to write Yoshimitsu FAQ. :) I hope you'll learn 
something useful or interesting! I also hope that my English will be easy to
understand :).

By now this FAQ is "Yoshimitsu Obsession Team exclusive"! (It means that it
will be updated only in the Yoshimitsu Obsession Team). That's because our
Yoshi Team site doesn't seem to gather Yoshi players... all of them stick to
Tekken Zaibatsu etc. Why? Are you too lazy to write something useful in our
Forums? You can also submit your strategies to be listed in the strategy 
page! Heh, you can even "Copy&paste" stuff from your posts. :P Just we need
your support. :) And I hope you'll send me comments or/and strategies to
this FAQ, I'm looking forward to receiving them! ^_^ (just don't bash me
too much, OK? :)

Anyway, I hope I proved with the following piece of hard work that there are
good Yoshi players in our Team, so all what you write in the forums will be
understood, heh. :P You can share your knowledge without fear, even if your 
opponent knows all your techniques, Yoshimitsu will still suprise him, and
even better: it will set up even more guess-up stuff. :)
That's why I wrote this FAQ. Especially for Yoshi players, but also for
our sparring partners not using Yoshi, to show them that even knowledge
about Yoshimitsu strategies won't help them in final match with the
Yoshi player's intelligence. :P

Also, I decided to write this FAQ because there are no really good T4 Yoshi
FAQs around the net... (there WEREN'T... MaddoN's FAQ is an exception! :)
It can be found in TZ) also, I have tested my skills in local tournaments 
and I wasn't an easy opponent to anyone :) I have still much to learn, 
though, so I hope that you, dear reader, will help me increase the number 
of Yoshi tactics and tricks listed here. :) 
Let's create the greatest Yoshi-compendium!

And remember: Yoshimitsu rulez forever!!!

OK, let's go with this stuff... :)

may be changed, especially on arcades or during tournaments.

==============================================================================
= [3] :: Introduction to Yoshi :) ::
==============================================================================

And here you decided to read about Yoshimitsu, one of the most unpredictable
and weird in general character in Tekken [ and Soul Calibur ] series. :) 
The space ninja who decided to wear a bug-like outfit, who stands on his 
sword, spits poison fumes, spins in all directions and can even fly a short 
distance :). OK, your choice... But it's a very good choice, indeed!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Changes... changes... ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yoshi has been toned down [ well, he was always being toned down every rele-
ased Tekken... ], but still he can kick ass with his newly increased speed and
unpredictibility [ more moves, extensions and Soul Stealer! ]. His strength is
now weakened, unfortunately. If we compare basic juggles from Tekken Tag and
Tekken 4, we will see a huge difference. Not only juggles, but also some of
his standard moves are weaker. Just to mention:
- d/f+2 basic uppercut - now it has slightly worse range, doesn't duck high
moves with good priority, has more disadvantage on block...
- 3 - takes less damage! Why!!!???
- f,f+4 - takes less damage and it's priority is weakened!!! It's the greatest
Namco's mistake, I think... It's now such a risky move! In previous Tekkens, 
the risk was worth taking it, but now... :(
...OK, more about moves in the Move Analysis Section. :)

Some of his moves have different notations [Wood Choper, Bad Breath, Flash..],
some of them have been strengthened [like 4,4,4, which is now in fact good!].
The throwing system has changed not only because of Position change, but also
in connection with movement: Now Yoshi can throw right from the SideStep and 
from Full Crouch Position [looks like WS :)]. Yoshi's throws have now also 
a better range... or maybe it's just my own impression?

SS+1+2 is not a Flea anymore, Yoshi will do a SS+1 instead. His stances are
now really powerful and have lots of extensions! The greatest re-build ever
was done with Yoshi's Meditation: now this stance has one of the greatest 
potential! Keep up the good work, Namco! :)

Yoshimitsu doesn't have a d+[throw] command low parry! WHY??!! The parry was
great, especially as a deceptive tool... everybody knows low parry to either
basic uppercut or lunging sweep or sword sweep... some of you know a Flash
set-up after throw, using a low parry that makes a tiny step forward...
GREAT mistake... standard low parry is NOT the same!

His suicidal attacks have now different properties :). f,F+1+4 Double Suicide
is not "Double" if it's the finishing attack for your opponent. :) Yeah, Yoshi
survives with no harm to him! It's a good solution for such a risky move, in
previous Tekkens the only thing you gained was Double KO. Just calculate the
lifebar status carefully if you don't want to end with no more but one 
point of health, staggering with your sword in the stomach, asking for KO.. :)
d+1+4~b+1,1,1,1,1,1 also has its uses! Now each spin takes a lot of energy, 
starting from 15 and ending with 30 points!!! Yoshi also travels further. :)

1+4 Flash, now called "Soul Stealer", is another Yoshimitsu's great suprise.
Soul Stealer doesn't damage an opponent and can steal some of his moves. I'm
not very enthusiastic about this move, but in fact it can be a good weapon if
used correctly, not only as a stealing tool, but also as Yoshi's ultimate 
shield or even a juggle-maker. :) 
Nevertheless, I loved the T3/TTT Flash, this one is not that good IMO...

Forget all what you know about Yoshi's standard spinning juggles. The number
and sequence of spins has changed, the juggle finishers have different 
properties [e.g. d/f+1,1,1 is one of the strongest JG finisher... o_O], and
you'll not only juggle to take damage, but also you'll juggle to gain
better positioning. Sometimes it will be better to cut the juggle short 
either to prevent it from missing or to start another combo. It often
happens near walls. You'll also juggle using stolen moves... 

Tekken 4 is a game in which whiffing is maybe the most painful. The Sidestep
priority is sometimes really frustrating, not to mention bugs caused by
rough surface or invisible walls... you'll often hear "That should have hit!", 
"I missed?! But it's a guarantee!!!", etc. Use "guaranteed" stuff ONLY if
you're sure that it will hit. :P

Another great change that you MUST keep in mind is the d+1, d/b+1 change...
In Tekken 4 d+1 is a sword slash whether d/b+1 is a standard basic low punch,
without which Yoshi's keep-away game, strings, offensive and defensive can't 
exist. It's extremely important! 

The detailed changes will be listed in Move Analysis section :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Why Yoshimitsu? ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why? WHY?! Everyone must at least try Yoshimitsu! His amazing fighting style,
taunting stances and extraordinary appearance is what made me learn him. :) 
His game story is also important: Yoshi is fighting for the poor! Yoshi is
ever-smiled but deadly, scary but good-hearted, hidden under a mask but 
sociable, with a great sense of humour... and also very wise. :) Don't 
believe me? Just read some of his words in the last section :).

In fact to win using him means to know himself and a whole game perfectly.
Yoshimitsu requires patience and devotion, great reflexes and calmness in 
the heat of a battle. You'll also have to calculate risk more than ever and
use more brain cells than in previous Tekkens :P The result will be amazing,
I assure you!

OK, maybe let's list some of Yoshi's pros and cons :)

PROS:
1. He's FAST! [ he has the fastest moves! ]
2. His potential is endless!
3. He has the best arsenal of unblockables!
4. He has awesome juggling capabilities!
5. His deceptive techniques are charming and deadly as well!
6. He has little moves with poor recovery time.
7. He's well-balanced, strong game in all distances.
8. His stances have tons of follow-ups!
9. He can STEAL MOVES!
10. You build your strings by yourself! [ custom stringing all the time ]
11. You have to THINK more than ever playing Yoshi, and that's 
very satisfying! You'll see!

CONS:
1. Lots of his moves have weakened damage.
2. His standard juggles are average.
3. His best throw [ Rainbow Drop ] has been weakened
4. He still has some useless moves [ like jumping 3... ]
5. The Flash [ Soul Stealer ] has different properties...
6. You have to take risk to inflict serious damage... [ but on the other hand: 
it usually ends in nearly instant K.O. :) ]
7. You have to be extremely patient to master Yoshimitsu
8. All strings you have to build by yourself: he doesn't have many
chained punch or kick series [ like Law, Bryan... ]. Well, it's not
a serious disadvantage, I even like it! [ see above :) ], but some people
count it as a disadvantage... don't know why. :)
9. You have to THINK more than ever playing Yoshi. :) [ some people do not 
like thinking, mwa hah hah :D ]
10. Highly advanced character: you have to take advantage on every 
occasion, every wall, every corner or slope... it makes Yoshi the real 
Demon of Fight :) [ it can also be a "pro" :P ]

To sum up: Yoshi takes a lot of time to master... he requires a complex
knowledge not only about himself, but a whole game and characters. I think it 
didn't suprise you: every Tekken player must know the game, but in case of 
Yoshi I have the impression that it's even more important. His strength lies 
exactly in taking advantage on just anything you can: I think this is what 
Namco wanted to tell us by giving Yoshi the Soul Stealer: A funny tool for 
stealing moves. In right hands it's deadly, in wrong ones: it's just a fun 
to try, nothing more. 

OK, but to move withing the game like in your home, you have to learn Manji 
Arts thoroughly, you have to feel Yoshimitsu's way of fighting. Watch his 
movement, his moves: their priority, range and properties... Use them in 
different situations... I hope this guide will help you develop your own style
of fighting, or even better: I hope you won't have any style and you will be 
totally creative or, as Bruce Lee once said:
You'll be "shapeless, formless", you'll be "like a water". :)

Eventually, what Yoshimitsu says is "Shiki soku ze kuu"! 
[ "The form is itself emptiness" - deeply philosophical thought... ]
If you want to know what it means, visit Yoshimitsu Obsession Team :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == For Beginners ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MaDDoN told me that my FAQ may look very advanced in the eyes of the beginner,
but in fact it's not. :) Well, you only have to have a good memory (because
all what I listed is quite important...), a devotion to study Yoshimitsu,
patience and of course, you have to have Tekken game and even better: the game
and sparring partner :)

You'll have to use Practice Mode a lot (well, I still use it to test some of
my ideas, thank Namco for Practice Mode!) to train juggles and get accustomed
to Yoshi's spinning patterns in them (if you have never played him, this may
cause some problems at the beginning... "was it 4 spins or 5?" :P Yeah, but
you'll find your system, don't worry. For example:
- to do d/f+2, b+1,(1),(1),1 you just do d/f+2 and IMMEDIATELY start spinning
by the time you see the second hit of the spin... because two spins in the
middle will miss for sure. It's a basic spinning pattern which causes some 
good damage with a juggle ender. Later you'll learn how to do more spins
after it...

In the practice mode you'll also have to test the moves' reach and priority,
examine the distance at which you can start the technique with little chance
to whiff, and also remember the hit ranges, it's extremely important. As your
experience will raise, you'll also learn other characters in this way. For
example, not knowing that Kazuya's EWGF hits high will make it very difficult
to win fight with him. Well, it's for Tekken beginners, because people playing
Tekken should have no problems with this FAQ at all... 

Then Frame Data... it's not a thing to make you scream because it's so much to
learn. No, it will only show you where you or your opponent is defenceless.
It's pure Maths! Even I don't remember all the frame parameters of his moves
(only of the moves that are his essence), and as far as moves that have
great disadvantage I just pray not to be punished. :P It's but useful e.g. if
your friend repeats the same technique, and you want to know if you manage
to do Roo Kick... etc. To make a use of these data you'll have to browse other 
character's frame data and just do some simple calculations. After a conclusion
you just launch practice mode and test the newborn technique...
This system is widely described at the beginning of Move List analysis. You
don't have to remember all these frames, it's enough to know that your opponent
can/can't do anything to you if you press active guard. It's also useful to 
know after which blows you have these belowed positive numbers of advantage
on block. Yoshi is poor in this area, only
1
b+1,1,...
d/f+1,1,1,1 (last hit)
leave you with advantage on block.
Also, the frames must be connected with your own experience in using a move,
for example: SS+1, which is in fact a safe move because it pushes you away.

What else? Well, Just extract from this FAQ all what you find out to be safe,
use at the beginning moves that I consider to be great (five or four stars of
rating), learn a few juggles... then after some time come back to this FAQ and
learn more. :) You don't have to jump from site to site to gather information
about Yoshi: I hope here's everything what you should know. After you play a
bit and understand a game, remember other character's techniques etc, then you
can use some of the guess up or oki-zeme strats listed here, ...
To sum up, even my style of playing have been changing all the time, what I
wrote here is 6-year experience (5-month experience in Tekken 4), and I'm
happy to make your life easier. Simply, you won't have to discover things that
I discovered earlier and after learning them, you'll have the opportunity to
focus on new tricks or techniques. 
Yoshi is a fun to play (and win :P), don't ever give up learning him!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
== General Play Style ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope that you have the Tekken 4 System down because I won't write much 
about it... By now this guide is for Tekken Players who know the basics of
the play and movement. Many things have changed since Tekken 3/Tag, so be
sure to read carefully [http://tekkenzaibatsu.com] the System Section in TZ.
Without this you won't understand the physics of the game, which will result 
in mistakes... Even if you think you know the game, but you haven't read all 
about Tekken System, read it just in case! Suprise in the battle ends in lost 
round, and eventually fight. It would be very stupid to lose e.g. because 
you didn't know how to recover from a stun...

Judging from my experience, being defensive really counts in Tekken 4, 
especially if you play Yoshimitsu. I do not mean that you just run away, 
doing nothing and waiting for a move: you'll be soon or later crushed by
your opponent's offensive jabs and strings, which are deadly especially 
because of shorter backdash distance. Heh, maybe "defensive" is not a good 
term, let's call it "hunting for occasion" :). After you have just caught 
the occasion :), you begin your offensive strategies wisely, reading your 
opponent and even making him do certain moves. "Wisely" means "do not attack 
chaotically". Yoshi doesn't have much moves with advantage after block, the 
only moves which have these properties are his 1 jabs and b+1,1 spins... so 
he's not ALL-offensive character. Keep it in mind! [ But in fact a good 
Yoshi player attacks all the time. :) Even at the defensive you can attack.
Anyway, the full strategy will be described in a separated section 
far below ^_^ ]

The best "occasion-catchers" are his jugglestarters. Opponent lying on the 
ground after a juggle has little ways to stand up or attack, it's the most 
advantageous position for you! The same goes to walls, but it's the other 
story. :) This knowledge in connection with Yoshi's powerful mid-low guess-up 
game is really deadly... not to mention the usefulness of stances, 
unblockables and in general his arts to fool your opponent for more damage! 
Well-played Yoshimitsu can be in fact unstoppable. :) The string starting 
from "catching the occasion" a few steps from the opponent [e.g. d/f+2] and 
ending really UPCLOSE with Yoshi's keep-a-pressure custom strings and low-mid
guess-up game in connection with good positioning can damage your opponent 
very badly, and you didn't use a whole Yoshi's potential! 

Are you interested? :)

==============================================================================

Some of you may bash me: "Hey, do you think I'm stupid?! I know these things!"
OK, so you can skip this section easily. :) But just in case, I decided to 
list here Yoshimitsu basics: that is: things without which Yoshimitsu can't 
exist... by now only the basics, and most common understandment of these 
terms. Then we will go through Move List Analyzis... and Advanced Strategy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Small note: Chickening ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ Yeah, reversals are still here in Tekken 4... :) ]

Some characters still have so called "reversals", and even an average Tekken
player should know how to escape them. If Paul/Nina reverses your left limb
[ 1 or 3 ], immediately press f+1+3. If it's the right limb [ 2 or 4 ], press
f+2+4. There are maybe only two moves which may cause problems with choosing
the way to escape a reversal: Kangaroo Kick [ from any position ] and WS+1+2
[ Namco should do something with this move... it's pretty much WS+1! >_< ].
Roo Kick can be chickened with f+2+4, and WS+1 with f+1+3. Solar kick can't
be either chickened or reversed. :) [ Depends on character...anyway, you 
don't have to bother about it. :) ]. The same goes to unblockables, which
in general can't be chickened, and some can't be reversed. Beware of 
Heihachi! He can reverse just about anything, even your Double Suicide!
Well, that's basically all about chickening... There are tons of FAQs about
Chickening only, and the "Buffering Guide" below will surely help you
understand "reversaling reversals" better. :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 == The Movement and Positioning ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The movement is an Art, indeed! You can guess from the very beginning of the
round if somebody is advanced or not, judging from the way he/she moves!
First step in advanced art of movement claims:
- "Forget about B and D walk in front of your opponent" :)
... unless you want to taunt somebody pressing "F" naughtily. :P
The "Walk" style of moving is very rarely used... not to mention you're 
harmful, especially in "F" version. Yoshimitsu is a stealthy ninja, he must
nearly fly all over the arena, quickly change positioning, dance! Since
Yoshi don't have any special motion inputs like Paul's Sway, we must do our
best with what we have. :P And what we have?
 - a really fast SS { Side Step }
 - dash forward
 - run
 - backdash
 - Walk up and down :)
 - Jump forward and backwards ( buffered, or with certain moves )

Only with these things you can work miracles. Characters in Tekken 4 in 
general look as if they were skating... LOL... Your main motion tools are
definitely Side Steps, dash forward and backwards. Chained together will make
Yoshi dance!
SSL [ Sidestep Left ], b,b~SSL, b,b, f,f, SSR...
Not to mention that you have a whole Yoshi's repertoire ready to use. Don't
forget about powerful Side Step attacks! They rock!!!! ^_^
There's also a "Double Sidestep": just press a Sidestep Command, and then 
hold the direction towards which Yoshi steps:
u,n~U or d,n~D
...and Yoshi's special step: SS to Yoshi's left and immediately b+3+4: one
of the fastest and most evasive movements! 
See also buffering guide for more dash variations :)

That were basic things: now I'll list his arts with most significant position
changes during/after execution:
 - Meditation variation [ rhyme! yai! :) ] 3+4, b -> repeat
 - Indian Sit [ yeah :P ]... and stances in general
 - d/f+3 
 - Hopkicks [ and all jumping stuff in general ]
 - Deathcopters, especially Deathcopter Trick 
 - Juggles! And most of his jugglestarters
 - Roo Kick
 - Fubuki
 - Spins
 - SS moves
 - Evasive Sidespin
 - Ninja blade smash
 - All Cartwheels [ f,f+1+2, f,f+3+4... ]
 - Confusion/Suicide
 - Manji Blood Dance
 - Wall Jump
 - Ochimusha Hunter...

And so on and so forth! Now I think it would be better to list moves during
which Yoshi doesn't change the positioning =much=... heh heh... I haven't
finished this list, but don't worry. These are only examples, I'll come back
to this topic in "Move List Analysis" section.
Just a word to finish this subsection: movement and positioning are extremely
important and so you'll notice that I'll constantly stress the importance
of these arts... The unified knowledge about the shape of the arena you're
fighting in, the distance your moves can cover, usefulness of Sidesteps and
dashes to gain better positioning and the "space instinct" [ so to call it...
you have to feel how far from the wall you are :) ] will improve your 
fighting very much. Not to mention fast Side Steps and dashes are quite 
difficult to focus on, every character sways a little bit during SS execution
and so e.g. if you go to FC position immediately after SS, you have great
chances it won't be noticed. [ and so FC, d/f+3 at the edge of the range
often suprises even most advanced players... I'll talk about it later :)]

And now a word for possible beginners:
Don't think that SS and dashes will "work for themselves", I saw many
players who wanted to move like their advanced opponents and in fact they
did even worse than before. Every move has to have a destination. Dash and SS
can be in any time cut short to gain high or low block. 
Example 1:
" You attacked Heihachi with a jab and you want to do SS+1 right afterwards.
Suddenly you noticed a familiar animation: Heihachi you're fighting against
loves using his 1+2 stunning move, which surely will beat you out of SS!
You !immediately! press "B" to cancel a Sidestep and block the uncoming move,
and you're not only safe, but you can score free 1,2,1 punches exploiting
Heihachi's disadvantage..."
Example 2:
" You're sidesteping and dashing in front of Kazuya, both you and Kaz have
the energy bar low... Kaz approaches you, and you're awared of any of his
move. Kazzy Sidesteps, you too... and just as you're sidesteping, Kazuya
does his Hellsweep hoping that it will hit you in the middle of Side Step.
No way, because you cut the SS short with low block. Kazuya staggers, and
you have a free u/f+3 juggle which ends a round..."

These movements [ SS, dashes ] can be also cancelled one into another... it 
looks very fluent and fast, it's not a long, full sidestep to full backdash,
but one command immediately after another, making Yoshimitsu dance!

See Buffering Guide to have a better view on Tekken System.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Short Buffering Guide ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tekken fighting system is very smart. :) It allows you to buffer a command 
into a recovery time of the previous move. For example, Sweeping Low Kick is
mainly a poking tool which come off only if buffered with previous moves! 
[ WS~D/B+3 : it's the input without buffering... well, really? I have the 
impression that it's buffered into a WS animation, LOL... ]. 
Try to buffer it in this way:
1, D/B+3, done one immediately after another, like 1~D/B+3
Did you succeed? ^_^ You should NOT do a first d/b+3,3,.. spinning low kick!
If you did the Sweeping Low Kick, you have the basics of buffering down. :)

Another example of useful buffer is throw buffering. Let's take a close look
at Rainbow Drop [ QCB+1+2 ]. The best set-up for this throw is a single 1 jab,
because it gives you much advantage if hits. [ In Tekken 3 it was nearly a
combo! ] Normally you would do:
1, QCB+1+2
It's OK, but well, you can do this much easier!
[1], QCB+2
[] brackets mean "hold the button". Lots of fun, neh? ^_^

Not only moves, but also a movement can be buffered. :) What about dashes?
The recovery time between one backdash and another is quite long, don't you
think? You can make it much, much shorter! Instead of:
b~b, b~b
Try this little buffering trick:
b~b~d/b, b~d/b, b~d/b...

It's a backdash cancelled by d/b directional command, in which is buffered 
"b" command, again cancelled by "d/b"... In this example you have to press
each direction separatedly, without "thumb-sliding" or "stick-sliding"
You should see Yoshi doing little backdashes repeatedly. :) 

It can be in theory endless... but practically it requires really great
manual skills. :) Often doing two backdashes is enough. :) 
Or maybe I'm too lazy to practice more backdashes? ^_^

A very useful buffer is instant WS (While Standing). Quite hard to do if
you have a bad controller, so be sure to have a proper joystick with
soft diagonals (and never lend it to anyone!). Try this:
d~d/b~b+4 or d~d/f~f+4
...depending which version you find out to be handier. :) But beware if
you want to do instant WS+1. Obviously do not try d~d/f~f! Heh heh!
This buffer is extremely useful in creating custom strings as it gives
you new possibilities. WS moves are in fact very good (WS+4 and WS+1 as
good examples), and should be used frequently! ^_^ It's your
MUSTLEARN technique, your Yoshi gameplay will improve greatly with this!
You won't have to go into FC, then WS, but you'll be able to do any
WS move instantly, just BOOM! -> WS+4. :) (not to mention the reach,
priority and great recovery time of this move. ^_^

Another example is jump backwards. Just for fun, because it's not much
useful in a fight. As you probably noticed, nobody can jump backwards in
Tekken 4 if not using any jumping move. 
But you can buffer a jump backwards, maybe not easily, but you can :)
Normal jump forward command is:
just u/f or U/F ^_^
If you want to jump backwards, you must do:
u/f~u~u/b !
Looks easy, but in fact it must be done extremely fast. :) In theory, it
can be done also by:
u/f~f~d/f~d~d/b~b~u/b ...
LOL! But you would have to have EXTREMELY superb manual skills. :) I have
never tried it, it's only a theory... maybe somebody will try and tell
me if my supposition is true. ^_^

Also, the chickening mentioned above is all about buffering! For example:
a friend of mine [playing Paul] loves to do a QCF+1 and follow it up by a 
reversal. If you know it, you can laugh at him with chicken :)
d/f+[2]~f+4
You do e.g. Basic Uppercut, hold on "2" and immediately press f+4. And you
have a nice chicken buffered! Don't forget to smile as the announcer says
"CHICKEN!" during Yoshimitsu's "punch-in-ya-face" animation. :)

Yoshimitsu without buffers is quite poor, so to speak. ^_^ Maybe it's not
his power, but it's the fun to use! Some of his buffers are also very
useful. You'll see "Unconventional Meditation Buffers" below. To suprise
your opponent with a low jab or hopkick from this stance really can help
you win! Let's examine Meditation Hopkick:
3+4, f~u/f+4
"f" command means "towards your opponent", just in case...
I can explain it in this way: Meditation [3+4] is cancelled by "f" command,
which is then immediately cancelled by u/f+3. :) It's very fluent, and 
should be done so, that is: VERY fluently. Practice it, ...
... and always warm up your fingers before a fight. :) Not warmed up,
you'll surely screw it up. :)

I hope I explained you the basics of buffering... it will make your battles
be more easy and "hand-friendly". ^_^ Especially if you are going to play
on a PS2 Joypad. :) Well, even on the Arcade Stick buffering won't make
your hands suffer after 1 hour of playing :) 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Other Yoshi basics... well, really? ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had some problems with this section, called "Yoshimitsu basics"... really!
The meaning of this word in this context is: "basic art is the art without
which Yoshimitsu can't live"... 
And so I wanted to list here Custom Strings, Juggles and Oki-zeme!
These arts really should be listed here, but as I started to describe 
them, I came to the conclusion that I started to explain advanced strategy...
What a mess! ^_^ 
So by now I decided only to give you definitions of these arts:
 - CUSTOM STRING - it's a set of moves that, if used properly, makes it very
difficult for your opponent to do much of anything besides blocking. A good
custom string must have three major features: flow, variation and destination.
But to build a good custom string, you must know Yoshimitsu's moves first. :)
I'll write a "good for custom strings" note in "Move List Analyzis" section.
Generally, most of custom strings are built with fast, basic moves, ended 
with Special Arts depending on destination.
 - JUGGLE - it's the way to keep opponent in the air just after you have 
launched him with any jugglestarter. A juggle is basically the "air combo",
and a combo by definition means "any sequence of hits which are unblockable 
after the first hit connects". If you're a beginner, you'll firstly learn how
to do combos... later, you'll create your own combos at will, even depending
on the onscreen situation, which is even more important in Tekken 4 with the
addition of walls. Anyway, I'll list a bunch of juggles in Move List analyzis
section, Yoshi's standard juggles are very easy... then we will go to Advanced
Juggling Section in Advanced Strategies part. :)
 - OKI-ZEME - it's the way to damage your opponent while he's on the ground,
including forcing him to the ground again (and again:) to take even more 
damage. Yoshimitsu's oki-zeme is weakened in "guaranteed" stuff, but if you
read your opponent perfectly, you can continuously knock him to the ground
and make him be afraid of getting up... thus giving you the opportunity to
take even worse damage on grounded opponent... eh, do you get it? If not, 
you surely will, as you get through Advanced Strategy Section. :)

#1 Last spin will cause Yoshimitsu to be dizzy and fall down.
#2 Can be done at any time except after the last spin.
#3 When Yoshimitsu gains energy the opponent loses energy, when 
 Yoshimistu loses energy the opponent gains energy.

#7 Repels all attacks.
#8 Yoshimitsu gains energy: see Meditation Chart below. 
#9 Start after first, second or third spin.
#10 Dive Bombo Hits grounded opponents if only is not followed by 
the Kangaroo Kick. 
#11 At the edge of a range the damage will be 20

#0 Yoshi stays in the spot, he DOESN'T track his enemy.
#1 Yoshimitsu gains energy, 5 points every bounce.
#2 Hold down 3+4. Yoshi tracks his enemy.
#3 Close range causes a behind the opponent teleport, 3 or more characters 
 away Yoshimitsu will be BT in the same spot.
#4 Last spin will cause Yoshimitsu to be dizzy and fall down.
#5 During Yogo Slide release just one kick button and then push 1 or 2. Yoshi
stays in the spot, saying naughty thingies. :) 
#6 Taunt 1: Yoshi's laughter!; 
   Taunt 2: "Jigajisan!" [ meaning "self-praise" ];
   Taunt 3: "Ansou shuha" - it means "I secretly wink at you"... LOL! 
#7 "Motion Taunt": Tap the direction: Yoshi will say a taunt. Next tap will 
unleash the same taunt. Hold the direction to stop saying the same taunt. 
Press now other taunt command and tap direction again :)

==============================================================================
= [6] :: Move List Analysis ::
==============================================================================

And here we go with the most important section, which (I hope:) will help you
learn Yoshimitsu's arts or increase your current knowledge. :) I'll list here 
just about everything I noticed about each of his move. Besides the moves, 
I'll also list some nice juggles, custom strings, set-ups and follow-ups to 
illustrate the move's properties better... Later, in Advanced Strategy 
section, we will try to put it all together in a nice and easy to remember 
summary. :) But first, let me explain the criteria I'll use:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Moves' Properties [ range, priority, distance, attributes, parameters ] ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**RANGE**
- you know: high, mid, Smid, low... hitting grounded opponent or not... 
...unblockable... however, some of Yoshi's moves have different range depending
on situation! Interesting, huh? :)

**PRIORITY***
- Range + Priority = True Range. :) As an example I'll give you SS+1 and d/f+2.
SS+1 has "awesome" priority, d/f+2 has "very good" one... and so SS+1 hits even
Xiaoyu in her Art of Phoenix stance whereas d/f+2 will surely miss... but both 
of them hit MID! ^_^ Funny, neh?
->> Priority levels:
poor, not very good, good, very good, awesome

**DISTANCE**
It's the distance which a move will cover /and/ best positioning to unleash
a technique with little chance to whiff.
->> Distance levels:
away - far, far away... no chance any move will hit, unless it's Shark Attack:)
far - it's the distance which two dashes forward can cover
farther medium - one "big" dash forward distance
medium - short dash forward distance, f+4 range, SS moves range
close - throw range, 1 jab range.
nose-to-nose - eeck, pixel chaos? :)

**ATTRIBUTES**
Heh heh, there are some attributes which are worth listing:
- dodging attitude: the name speaks for itself :P
- position change attribute - does Yoshi travel during a move anywhere?
 1. Stationary move - Yoshi doesn't go anywhere :)
 2. Approach attitude - best move to shorten the distance, 
 3. Retreat attitude - best move to run away
- special attributes - JG, CS, KD... etc.
- deception attitude - watch what your opponent will do after this move and 
teach him a lesson :)... or... trick'em into receiving more damage!

**PARAMETERS**
Supported with Frame Data, these parameters will tell you if Yoshi is safe 
after a move or not, and what benefits you have after a move. "Frames" are 
a number of animation frames per second. [ one frame is 1/60 a second! ]

- Speed [Fhit] will tell you how fast a move is executed. This does NOT 
include the number of frames it takes to input the command. 

- Block Advantage [Badv] - The number of frame advantage or disadvantage 
when the move is blocked. Meaning the amount of frames it takes before you 
can input a new command. Positive numbers are advantages over your opponent, 
negative numbers indicate a disadvantage and KD indicates the opponent gets 
knocked down. Usually moves with -8 or less adv. on block are considered to
be safe. Keep in mind that sometimes you can block earlier than actually
input any command. -12 Badv doesn't neccessarily mean that you can't block
for 12 frames, but that you cannot do any command for 12 frames.

- Hit Advantage [Hadv] - The number of frame advantage or disadvantage on a 
hit. Keep in mind a hit does not necessarily results in an advantage over 
the opponent. Frame advantage on stagger moves reflects the amount of 
stagger frames, this does not equal the number of frames your opponent 
cannot block attacks.

- Counter Hit Advantage [CHadv] - The number of frame advantage or 
disadvantage on a Counter-Hit. Keep in mind a Counter-Hit does not 
necessarily results in an advantage over the opponent.

- Advantage over crouching opponent [Hcadv] - The number of frame advantage
or disadvantage after hiting a crouching opponent. 

- Whiff recovery [WFrec]- my impression about the recovery speed if a move 
whiffs. The Frame Data parameters above doesn't neccessarily mean that 
a certain move will act the same if not "in touch" with an opponent...

Simple calculation examples:
1. Paul's jab has 8 frames [Fhit], Yoshi's jab has also 8 frames [Fhit]
Yoshi's jab also has +2 frames [Badv], which means that Paul can't do a 
move for 2 frames. So if Paul wants to reatliate with jab after blocking
your one, the speed will be:
Paul's 8 + Yoshi's 2 = 10 frames [Fhit]
So Paul's jab will come off in 10 frames after command input. It means
that if Yoshi also tries a second jab, he will hit Paul earlier...etc.
2. You hit somebody with f+2, which has +17 [Hadv]. It means that you
have d/f+2 guaranteed, because its execution time is 16 frames [Fhit]
It will fit in the gap :P
3. Kazuya blocked your FC,d/f+3. If you immediately press high block, you
won't be hit by his WS+2, because your recovery [Badv] is -16 frames, and
his WS+2 is executed in 17 frames [Fhit]. But he may try other moves which
will hit you for sure, e.g. WS+4,4...
etc...

If Frame Data don't tell you much, I will create a short Recovery levels:
So, the recovery can be...
Tragic, poor, not very good, quite good, good, very good, awesome. :)

I'll also create a general rating system if you are too lazy to read all about
each of the listed move:

*      - one of Yoshi's worst moves, very specific uses, hardly used
**     - below Yoshi standards, useful only in certain situations
***    - standard Yoshi move, not bad, not great: just average
****   - above average Yoshi move, great uses, and versatile
*****  - definitely Yoshi's best move, tons of uses, a main weapon :)

OK, LET'S GO! ^_^

After Rising Kickup b+3+4 (When On Ground FU/FT), opponent suffers Guard Break
on block which you can exploit. Immediately tap 1 to juggle your opponent.
Sample juggles:
b+3+4 (blocked, GB), 1, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, d/f+3,1     [dmg 31]
b+3+4 (blocked, GB), 1, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, b+1, f+3    [dmg 31]
b+3+4 (blocked, GB), 1, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, f+3         [dmg 27]
etc, etc... :)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you are on the Ground FU/FT, the 3 kick juggles your opponent, and so you
have u/f+3+4, u+1+2~U~N, 1+2 guaranteed. (go to Pogo Section if you don't
know what is this U~N. It's the way to increase the Sword's strength...)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description                Command:            Advantage (in frames)

Close Straight Push        1+3~f               10   
Close Side Push            1+3~(u_d)           12   
Reverse Push               1+3~b               18~20   
Distance Straight Push     1+3~f               17~19  
Distance Side Push         1+3~(u_d)           17~21 

So what does it all mean? These advantage frames you gain after you push your
opponent into a wall. A lot of, huh? To be honest, I'm not very much 
experienced in wall pushing area, my opponents love jabbing around and usually
I can't get my way through their jabs with this push... The best way to set it
up is to jab opp. yourself: on hit you have the required advantage to do f+1+3
and your opponent can't interrupt it. He can only duck or escape (and as far
as I know, the escape window is smaller that in regular throws).
After a successful wall push, you can unleash some damaging combos:

After Straight Push 10~19 - f,f+4, 4,4,4

Yoshi's Classic throw! I love it, it has been with him from the very beginning
of the Manji adventure. :) It has now different properties, though.
d+3 is no longer guaranteed, unfortunately... you have much more options to
chose, but every one of them can be defended against. At the beginning I 
recommend you:
- Cyclone Lift d+1+2 - It's for opponents who love standing with any kick from
the ground (in this case you have a free juggle!!! They won't manage to hit 
you with 4 before it connects, and in case of 3 they must be super-fast. ^_^
Not to mention CH and Clean Hit, and juggle.) and who are afraid and just lie
doing nothing (it hits for 12 damage points). It also hits ppl. who just 
stand up (it's often the case in the higher level of play, also: you are 
completely safe after it hits). But as your opponent switches to backroll or
sideroll, you'll have to change your strategy.
- d+1 Sword Slash - hits your opponent's sideroll and backroll attempts, also
hits him as he stands up... but can be hit by any rising kick.
- then we have d/f+3,1 Wood Cutter: hits just about anything (sideroll, any
kick attempts, backroll...), BUT can be defended by straight get up, and
jabbed out in the middle of the move (before the sword conmnects). Your
opponent can also wait and allow the d/f+3 kick to whiff, and kick you
before the sword connects... anyway, great move!
 - 3+4, 3+4 Meditation to Back Handspring is interesting since your opponent
will miss with any rising kick, which often occurs because Yoshi seems to be
harmful... they stand up with a kick just to get juggled... Much more painful
is 3+4, f+2 combination, after whiffed kick you feast your opponent with a
Manji Backfist + juggle... ouch, it really hurts! ^_^ It also hits opponents 
who decide to stay on the ground, but it doesn't hit any backroll or sideroll.
 - f,f+2 will hit any kick attempts (looks cool!!!) and sometimes a backroll,
and it will travel to the other side if opponent stays on the ground. Nice
thing to try. :) Has some weak points, but looks cool :)
 - SS to Yoshi's right (opponent's head), d/b+1+2~any - many times it catches
your opponent. :) any rising kick will miss due to SS, and they may evaluate
your Bad Breath duration incorrectly, and stand up just to score a puff of
smoke into face... and obviously, a juggle :)
Etc, etc... there are much more extensions... experiment!
 
Another nice strategies after this throw connects are "hop over" tricks. Just
do a hop forward over lying opponent and immediately press d/b+1 (it's a low 
punch). If your opponent tries any standing kick, you'll jump over him and
hit his back with d/b+1, after which you have WS+4 guaranteed. :) (what you'll
do next is up to you... you still has opponent's back exposed! ^_^). BUT if
your opponent stands up, you won't jump over him... you can continue with
custom string or suprise your opp. with a Sword Sweep... whatever you want.

To sum up: many options, none of them strightly guaranteed... you can do your
best by making your opponent think you'll do the same move all over the time,
and then switch to another option. Best combination is Cyclone lift at first,
then Wood Cutter or d+1 for Backroll or sideroll. Try also that Meditation
trick, it's worth the damage it can inflict! ^_^ And you're safe in most 
cases after 3+4, 3+4, don't forget that you can follow it up with BT d+1 
which can't be interrupted (only blocked or parried, or rarely: SideStepped).

"Oni Killer" - I like this name! ("Oni" means "devil") In fact you have less
options after this move than after previous throw...
 - d+3: will hit any kick, stand up, sideroll attempt... (and your opponent
will show his back to you!), but it can be escaped by backroll... beware, 
even if your opponent lands backturned after it hits (which happens many times
especially if your opp. tries a kick). Best choice is to do WS+4, it can only
whiff... other moves are risky.
 - d+4: it will hit anything... besides lying still. Well... I guess nothing
is prefect in this Tekken... :) Why not to have any guarantee? :)
 - u/f+3 is a great tool :) It will hit a backroll, any fast kick attempts,
it can be only beaten by "wait & let whiff", by sideroll (but you're safe if
opponent siderolls...). With this "wait", your opponent must time his moves
precisely. If he'll wait a little bit longer, Yoshi will land behind him
and begin a classic "hop over" tricks... ^_^ It's WORTH doing!
 - "hop over" tricks are better here than in previous throw. :) Try them!
(jump over to d/b+1 punch and WS+4 kick...remember that after WS+4 you can 
press d/b+1 again! It will nail any stand up attempt. Worth trying!)

Well, this throw has been toned down :( It used to take 50 damage points! Now
it's 39, and the Sword Slice is not guaranteed! (and it used to be...)
BUT... :)
 - Sword Slice d+1 is indeed good as a follow-up, it hits ANYTHING! It has 
only one disadvantage: it can be stopped by Ankle Kick. :) But the Ankle Kick
must be done ultra fast... so if your opponent becomes predictable, go for low
parry! (and juggle, of course) It's simple as that. :)
 - kinda risky follow-up is u/f+1+2~D Deathcopter: it hits opponent on the 
ground and backroll attempt, but it doesn't hit backroll->backdash, and Yoshi
may land behind your opponent as he stands up straight (but it rarely happens)
With quick reflexes, you can slightly delay the Deathcopter but still, your
opponent may chose to SideStep or just punch you out of the air. This follow
up is good if your opponent is afraid of getting damage and is likely to 
commit stupid mistakes :)
As a set-up of this throw I recommed you a single 1 jab (remember the Short 
Buffering Guide? :), or any move pushing your opponent back if you expect 
he'll rush in. E.g. SS+1, d/f+4, especially on hit.

Eeeeh... Yoshi's "new", cool throw and must be so much ripped of positives? 
Dammit, it's slow, and if escaped (which happens quite often), Yoshi loses 
energy and gives it to opponent? WtF?! Not to mention weakened damage... I
rarely use it, mainly as a show-off move. >_<
As far as Possession QCB, F+2: hah hah! It would be a nice guess-up IF it
could be escaped! But it can't, it's obviously Yoshi who generously gives
energy to his opponent... but why can't it be escaped? It would be nice if you
did this throw, opponent escaped, and Yoshi would receive energy. It would be
a great guess-up game... but well, I suppose Namco's Tekken Team was too lazy.
Positives of the Great Soul Spihon throw?
 - it looks REALLY great! 
 - it has a very good recovery time if whiffed, which can be used as a set up
   e.g. after 2+4 throw. QCF+2 over lying opponent, then SSR (a possible
   rising kick misses) and u/f+3 for a juggle...
Last words: it's a SHAME that Yoshi's front throws has been so much weakened.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think I don't have to describe Yoshi's side and back throws... the damage is 
known, they do not have any good follow-ups... nothing to mention. :) 
The most desired is obviously Yoshi's backthrow, "Tornado Drop", called also
"Manji Wind God"... it does a huge damage of 70 points and is often used in
Yoshi's wall game as well as in some "after f+2" guarantees. Read on! :)

(Please note that some of the basic arts will be analyzed in "Special Arts"
section, just as all "d/f" moves... I decided not to describe his FC basics

 - left jab is so important that it will be listed in "Special Arts" section.
 - right jab will be described in "2,4" PK Combo Table.
 - left and right kicks will be described in Oni Kick Combo and Triple

 - d/b+3 is a starting move of Spinning Low Kicks and will be described in
   its section.
Well, I think that's all... anyway, full Yoshi's Frame Data is available in
Tekken Zaibatsu or Yoshimitsu Obsession Team :) Just in case you don't believe
me that e.g. his UF,n,3 kick (that spinning one) is not useful and risky...)

It's not that "low", but Smid... the name is a remaining from Tekken 2 times,
where it really was a low punch. But I guess it was too fast to be a low 
strike, and Namco came to the conclusion that a new range must be added: Smid.
Meaning that you can block it both standing and crouching. But it didn't 
change the punch'es priority, it's incredibly fast, and stops almost 
everything in the spot. It's your main poking/interrupting tool, a must-use
move to build fast and quick-retracting custom strings. 
Just don't get too much predictable, on the high level of play your opponent
may parry it easily. You know what a parry means in case of Yoshimitsu: a
guaranteed juggle and all nastiness afterwards. :) Just beware. :)
Also, the d/b+1 initial animation doesn't dodge anything, keep it in mind.
Even a throw can catch you inbetween. If you have it blocked, use the follow
ups with caution, because you may be nailed on opponent's quick jabs. Remember
that after block you're at the disadvantage: slight but present. :) Opponent's
fast WS move will hit you earlier!

It's not that "low" again, but Smid. :)
This version is kinda slower than d/b+1 punch, also the input is different.
Well, it's because somebody WISE (irony!) coded d+1 as a Sword Slice. I had
really hard times with Yoshi before I learned not to press d+1 to interrupt
somebody's attack :) Instead of d+1, I used d+2 to get used to new commands.
Well, d+2 has better range and damage rate, but it won't fit in places where
d/b+1 always fits. :) Some moves can be interrupted only by d/b+1.
After a bit of practice, you'll surely switch to d/b+1 and you won't get a
Sword Slice instead, but with a bad controller, I advise you to use d+2 if
you don't want to score a powerful blow in Yoshi's face during his Sword Slice
animation :). Also, it can be low parried, so beware :)

And this is at last a "low" move :)
Yoshi's standard low kick is very fast, hits low and generally is used to 
annoy your opponent and take some energy from his lifebar, point by point :)
Good in custom strings, relatively safe, it's rarely blocked (if used at 
correct times!). Doesn't hit grounded opponents, but hits a sideroll and
roll back attempts. Good move, use it! ^_^ What a pitty it's toned down :/
It used to give you advantage on hit, and was completely safe if blocked...
Also, remember that it can be low parried. :)

This low kick hits also grounded opponents and should be used for this

Great move, very fast and handy, used mainly in fast custom strings. It combos
together with 1 jab and f,f+4 Fubuki, ... yeah, it's inescapable! It's one of
Yoshi's little guarantees, with a little bit of practice, you'll use it 
whenever WS+1 connects. It's also nice as a throw set-up since your opponent
can't move for a whole 9 frames. He can only duck a throw or escape it.

Yoshi's Rising Uppercut is interesting, but I would prefer it juggling even
without CH, like e.g. Jin's, Law's, Bryan's Rising uppercuts... I suppose
Yoshi would be too good with another non-CH juggle starter, even with such a
slow one like this :)
Yes, it's slow, but it's not a serious disadvantage. If used correctly, it
can be a nice addition to Yoshi's repertoire. Safe, leaves you with advantage
on hit (you can continue custom string), juggles on CH... it flows well 
together with d/b+1, if somebody tries any jabs inbetween, he will get 
juggled... 
d/b+1, WS+2
(or at least both Yoshi and opponent will get hit, if your opponent has 
quick reflexes and 8-frame jab). Good move, use it from time to time :)

One of Yoshi's most powerful kicks, but unfortunately, it's most "bugged" in
the game. Often it doesn't hit at all, it just goes through a pixel mess of 
your opponent's head and just MISSES :). 
Anyway, it's useful in some combos, e.g. after a Roo Kick, because versus 
certain characters this move causes a "camera chaos", and you just can't do
anything besides this kick... It will be described later in Roo Kick Table.

Another of Yoshi classics... this kick has awesome reach and priority and is
also used in quick custom strings. You'll find it's usefulness by yourself
for sure. You can also utilize it from Instant While Standing technique:
d~d/b~b+4 or d~d/f~f+4

This kick saves Yoshi's *** in many situations! You'll see by yourself! It's
extremely fast, damaging, and has awesome priority! Also, Yoshi can kick BT 3
from almost impossible positions (even if he shows his side to his opponent,
very useful against Steve and his Guard Breaking, OSB punches). ^_^ You'll
use it VERY often out of Meditation, whiffed Indian Sit Dive Bomb (also called
"Indian Sit Cannon"), after any BT combination if your opponent rushes at you.
Not to mention Yoshi loves this position, he travels to BT many times, most
of his deceptive tricks involve this very efficient but also risky 
positioning. Just why, WHY Yoshi's basic kick is equally strong as 3 Oni Kick?
Groan, it looks silly that Kazuya has his funny 4 kick stronger than Yoshi's
3, in which Yoshi really puts a whole body into it! OK, stop complaining...:)
BT kick will be often used by you, you'll see :)

Just to be sure: u/f command means "towards your opponent", if you consider
Yoshi's face to be "f", it would be BT u/b+4...
Anyway, there are three versions of this hopkick, u/b, u and u/f one, they
differ in recovery and reach. u/b+4 version doesn't juggle, it's mainly a 
"retreat" move... not very good, because the hopkick is itself quite slow. :)
The hopkick is used mainly as an alternative to BT d+1 low punch: a very good
one, because people expecting low punch will either block or try to parry...
and get juggled by this hopkick. But you must be very close! This hopkick
tends to whiff if your opponent crouches in medium distance.
Juggles:

Standard stunning kick... if you have it blocked, you're gone :) I didn't
experiment with it, but it must have a set-up... just like the Mishima's
stun kick if opponent does QR after their f,f+1+2 throw. Yeah, they have this
kick guaranteed. How about Yoshi? Well, I don't know any useful set-up, I'll
let you know if I find something... (or maybe you know a nice set-up for this
move? :) But if it hits, you have a lazybone combo guaranteed :) (f+3,3 does
about 54 points of damage). Anyway, this move was worth listing, because it
can inflict some serious damage. :)
Oh, you can try it e.g. after Pogo Combo. Just like:
FC,d/f+3, u+1+2,1+2, UF,N,3
It's not a guarantee, but many times it catches your opponent off guard. You
can also switch to Jumping Low Kick after it... :)
You must press U/F (hold) and input 3 at the apex to do this kick :)

This low kick is interesting... a standard player won't expect a low kick
after a jump, but at higher level of play: it will be surely noticed, unless
you really suprised somebody with this... a nice follow-up is ~b+1 Sword
Sweep (you're already in FC), it's rarely escaped.
You must press U/F (hold) and input 3 on the way down to do this kick :)

An underestimated kick, which is quite fast as for jumping move, retracts
very quickly, damages very badly and has very good priority! If you have it
blocked, your opponent must be very fast to feast you with his jabs since it
pushes him away. You're in most cases safe! It hits side roll attempts if used
correctly, it can even hit Xiaoyu out of her Art of Phoenix stance. 
After FC, d/f+3 or FC, b+1, it hits any backroll attempts. A great kick to
mix with u/f,N,d+3. :)
I input the command in this way: u/f,N,d+4. In this way I'm sure I won't
get the "at the apex" version, but desired "on the way down" one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The command is also U/F,4, but I prefer writing U/F+4. The 4 input is "at the
apex". Well, a very good kick, strong juggle filler, also nice in direct 
attack since you're relatively safe if it's blocked. If it hits, you gain
advantage and good "nose-to-nose" positioning to begin your custom string. 
(I recommend d/b+1 custom string starter :)
I often use it from BT position, the parameters are just the same. :) It also
flows well together with SS+1 on hit (just be sure your opponent won't SS 
after it:) and with any move that pushes your opponent back.
On CH you score a KD, but sometimes it's a very strange Knock Down: you land
behind your opponent! You have a small juggle guaranteed on this occasion:
BT d+1, FC,d/f+3
Looks funny! Always be ready for this possibility! 
Also, you can hold the U/F a little bit longer and press 4 slightly later to
do a delayed version of this hopkick... you're less safe than in previous
version, but anyway:) Let's call it Jumping Hopkick #2. Versus Xiaoyu and
Julia, if you manage to get into nose-to-nose distance, it's a kind of 
unblockable, LOL...
Yoshi will jump OVER her and kick her in her back! ^_^ She can't block it,
looks very funny :) But it's only VS Xiaoyu and Julia tip, only they're so 
small that Yoshi can jump over them.
Version #3 of this Hopkick can be done by 4 input "on the way down". Best 
reach, but also worse recovery time. Just watch your opponent and decide which
version may connect :)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are NOT all Yoshi's basic arts... please experiment with other listed in
the Movelist, especially with jumping 1s :) I mean it! Know every move Yoshi
possesses to master him! ^_^

Yoshi's basic punch! It's not an official move, but it's definitely worth
making a separated section about it. It's your ultimate poking tool, with 
an awesome priority (as I sometimes say, it can even hit "the air before your
opponent" ^_^), the ADVANTAGE if blocked and great advantage if it hits, and
it's your basic tool for juggles, combos and custom strings. Every character
has strong jabs in tekken 4 in general, and Yoshi is no exception... many 
times if I don't know what to do, I tack a few jabs in the air to think a
while. :) Don't forget that Yoshi's jab is one of the fastest in the game, 
you'll surely win in jab war with Heihachi, Kazuya and Jin. Only two moves
are faster than this jab... but don't worry, you have both of them! ^_^
Please note that if you press f+1, the jab will come out slower, but it will
also retract faster, and the damage will be "6" for this version, not "5":

a whole body in the blow, making it stronger...

Yoshi's classic three-punch series. Always guaranteed 19 points if first hit
connects :) The following second and third punches hit MID, which means it can
NOT be ducked under. It's good versus characters that have evasive sways, like
e.g. Steve Fox. Keep in mind that if you have it blocked, your opponent can
retaliate easily with fast punches... I have no idea why the disadvantage 
after this move is so big... it's maybe the biggest disadvantage after 
standard, weak punch series! "Jab - Double Uppercut" is a starting 
combination of the following 10-strings (programmed series of moves):

   command:                 damage:                    range:
 = 1,2,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1      5,8,6,9,9,5,5,8,8,30      hmm"h"h"Lm{!}{!}*!* 
Well, nice 10-string, but the first 4,4 kicks are quite slow and can be
easily ducked under: if not the first, the second will surely be. :) 
 
 = 1,2,1,4,4,4,1,3+4        5,8,6,9,9,5,5,25          hmm"h"h"Lm"m 
The same story: the kicks in the middle are too slow! However, both 10-strings
are the beginner-killers :) It's quite unfair, but hey, they should know how
to avoid these strings. ^_^ Teach them a lesson :)

 = 1,2,1,4,2,2,2,4,1,1      5,8,6,9,3,3,3,7,8,30      hmm"hmmm"m{!}*!*
Oh, this one is nice! Of course I do not mean a whole String, but only a part
of it. In the higher level of play, you'll be badly punished after the 4
Fubuki-like move. You can mix 1,2,1,4,2,(2,2) [bracket is optional] with 
alone 1,2,1 to mess up a little :) After 2 on hit it's good to follow up with
FC, b+1 Sword Sweep. Well, everytime I use it my opponent fall prey to this,
the main rule is: SUPRISE. :)
To sum up: 1,2,1 to punish some slow-recovering moves, and sometimes do not
stop but continue with ~4,2,(2,2), and you're close, in FC position, ready
to unleash Yoshi's nose-to-nose nastiness :)

Spins! You can start them at "medium" range, but first spin will whiff. A 
great way to approach your opponent. They're also Yoshi's precious juggle
fillers, the fastest ones, and also quite damaging. First spin leaves Yoshi
with HUGE advantage on hit, you can easily unleash a throw which your opponent
can't interrupt. (he can only duck or escape). Also, the first two spins are
guaranteed on hit. Unfortunately, your opponent can duck these spins at every
point if he blocks... that's why what makes these spins really precious are 
its extensions! (rating: ***** with extensions :)

 = ~3+4          = Evasive Side Spin     [dmg -8 to Yoshi]   ?    
GREAT extension! Especially if you want to approach your opponent safely. 
Yoshi will spin forward and immediately spin aside, making all what your 
opponent throw at you whiff. :) (all what is the linear attack... some blows
will hit, like e.g. King's SS+3+4, I mean mainly horizontal attacks). You can
do it whenever you want but not after 6th spin, obviously. The b+1~3+4 and
b+1,1~3+4 versions work best for me in the medium distance. Don't be afraid
of losing lifebar! But also: don't abuse this move stupidly. You have to 
predict when your opponent wants to attack you. You'll see that after a 
little bit of practice, you won't do this move in vain. :)
Best follow-up, depending on the opponent's move that has just whiffed,
is d/f+2, throw or f+2... my personal favourite is d/f+2.

 = d/b+3,3,f+4   = Topspinner Attack     7,5,12            l,l,m   
Can be utilized after 1st, 2nd or 3rd spin. :) If it's b+1,d/b+3,3,f+4 
version and b+1 hits, the low kicks are pretty much guaranteed. :) Do not
forget to chicken f+4 if you expect it to be reversed. Low kicks are rarely
blocked, it's a great weapon if used correctly. :) Just, as always, don't
become predictable :)

 = d/b+3,3,d+3+4 = Spin & Sit            7,5,--            l,l,--  
A show-off move, and also a nice suprising extension... Indian Sit extensions
ready to use after it! ^_^ I use it from time to time, mainly to do the 
Indian Sit Moonsault Slayer, or just to teleport behind. Please note that 
after the kicks hit your opponent, Yoshi sits not directly in front of your
opponent, but slightly on the side. It makes even more hits thrown at you
whiff. :) Even low jabs/linear attacks hitting ground!

 = d/b+3,3,3     = Spin to diziness      7,5,5             l,l,l   
Well... not recommended... :) It won't help you much, if opponent blocks all
low spins, you'll get juggled anyway on higher level of play. :)

it here, it's not anti-Yoshi FAQ :)
What more can I say... USE IT! ^_^ If you don't know any juggles after this 
move, here you are: (with the starter)

CH SS(R)+1, f+1, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, f+3                [dmg 52, tricky!*]        
CH SS+1, f+1, b+1, f,f+3,3                           [dmg 50, tricky!***]
CH SS+1, f+1, b+1, d/f+3,1                           [dmg 48]
CH SS(R)+1, f+1, f,f+3,3                             [dmg 46, tricky!**]
CH SS+1, f+1, b+1, d/f+2, f,f+2                      [dmg 45]
CH SS+1, f+4,4 (you can continue with 10-string! ^_^)[dmg 45]
CH SS+1, f+1, b+1, d/f+1,1,(1) (and d+1)             [dmg 43,(49)+10 Sword S.]

(three d/f+1,1,1 hit only if opponent is well-aligned. Two d/f+1,1 are safer.
After two hits d/f+1,1, the d+1 Sword Slice is guaranteed unlike d/f+1,1,1.)
Well, also try to make your own juggles :) I'm not a juggle-lover, for me they
are Yoshi's MUSTLEARN to take as much advantage as you can. In the fight
what really counts is effectiveness. Anyway, I prefer on-the-ground strategies
and after-juggles follow-ups, that's why I didn't make a separated section for
juggles BY NOW... but Juggling will be mentioned again in Advanced Strategy
section, don't worry. :)
Last word: dammit, use this move, ABUSE IT! Wha hah hah! :) Seriously: it's a
marvellous attack, you have to incorporate it into your standard repertoire.

Tricky* - you must Sidestep to Yoshi's right and launch opp. very close!
Tricky** - works against "big" opponents such as Paul, Marduk...
Tricky*** - hard combo, timing must be perfect!

If you don't have it interrupted inbetween, it means your opponent has

Classic "after backhand" spinning slaps... they can't be interrupted if 
backhand connected on block, thus making the backhand safer. Standard. :)
To sum up, a whole d/f+1,2 d/b+2,2 can be sometimes used, especially if your
opponent doesn't duck backhand and d/f+1,1,1,1 Door Knocker. But if he does,
you'll get punished!
Please notice that if your opponent gets nailed on the backfist, Yoshi gains a
HUGE advantage... it's enough for a free backthrow, I guess... :P

Yoshi's classic Door Knocker! Two first hits are safe on block and combos
together, making it a nice approach tool. ^_^ You can delay the Door Knocker
hits, every one of them: I like delaying d/f+1>1 and d/f+1,1>1 ... but the
last one is also nice to be delayed. :) First three hits are often used as a
combo/juggle finisher, it's Yoshi's strongest finisher and also a move that
nails your opponent to the ground. He can't quickroll. :)
Great move, but use it with wisdom: the two hits inbetween can be ducked!
For people who loves ducking it's nice to do d/f+1,1 and follow it up with
u/f+3 :) It's killing especially if the d/f+1,1 hits. :) Hah hah hah. :)
(P.S. It's also a newbie-killer move: Yoshi gains advantage after the last
move, blocked or not... you can d/b+1, and again Door Knocker till the end.
It's naughty, but hey: beginners must learn to be better! ^_^ Just be fair
after some won rounds and tell them how to avoid it... ^_^ )

Eeeh? What is this for? It's pretty much WS+1, but one frame faster... pretty
useless, you have much more guarantees after WS+1. I would rather have this 
move changed in next Tekken, to more powerful one. The input is 1+2 and Yoshi
uses only left hand? Makes no sense...
Anyway, you can use it in custom strings, it's a good move...

It shortens the distance a LOT! But also Yoshi lands in BT position, which is
not very nice so close to your opponent, especially if he has just blocked 
this move... if it hits, you gain advantage (BT d+1 recommended ^_^, but any 
Solar Kick follow-up can be done safely) if it's blocked... well, you MUST go
for some particular extensions not to get punished. :) 
(note: "f" means "towards your opponent" - he's backturned, but moves are done
as if he was in normal stance, facing his opponent)

Command         Name                     Damage            Range
 = ~B+3+4       Evasive Sidespin         -8 to self        ? :)
The move of your choice if you have the Solar Kick blocked, and best move
if it connects! You escape everything that your opponent may throw at you,
and you can immediately retaliate with BT 2 Manji Backhand, BT 3 Kick or
BT u/b+4 hopkick! Some jabs may reach you, though (like Paul's 1,2), but
it rarely happens. GREAT follow-up!!! Note that sometimes one spin is not
enough, but two spins should be O.K. for everything. :)

 = D/B+2,2...   Reversed Manji S. Slaps  10,10,8,8,8,6     mmmmm  
A good move for deceptive purposes :) But if you had the Solar Kick blocked,
you may be poked out of it... anyway, it's nice to spin away a little (one,
two spins) and then suprise your opponent by BT Hopkick, jumping Hopkick
or Manji Backfist... good uses, nice follow-up :)

 = qcf+1        Rev. Moonsault Slayer    30,15,28          !!{!}  
Mainly a show-off move, you'll get jabbed out of it if Solar Kick is blocked
 
 = d+3+4        Indian Sit Backwards     --                --   
Good move! It will avoid all high and some mid moves you opponent may want
to throw at you, even if Solar Kick is blocked! It can be interrupted by
low punch or some fast mid moves, but generally you're safe, and certainly
you won't get thrown/juggled. :) Not to mention Indian Sit extensions...

    = B         = Deathcopter Trick      35                {!}   
Well, another show off... Deathcopter Trick can be somewhat useful, but 
I have never used it in the heat of the battle.

    = ~1+2      = Reversed Ochimusha H.  15                <!>   
In fact reversed Sword Spin has it's uses! They'll be widely described in
"camera chaos" tricks... in some juggles you can exploit opponent's 
Quick Roll, do f,f+1+2 do get behind and e.g. suprise him with sword spin.
Reversed Sword Impale must be used with more caution.

 = F+(1+4_2+3)  Possession              -35                throw    
Well, just some throws... I do not recommend them, unless your opponent is 
sleepy or busy with something, or actually playing chess. :)

 = 1+2          Reversed Flea            21                {!}    
Maybe it has some uses, maybe not... it just shows you that Flea (Pogo) can be
performed backwards. You can use it, but only in some "camera chaos" strats.
  
 = d+1+4        Harakiri                 60                {!}
Too slow to connect on a standing opponent, but it can be actually good as a
trap for opponents standing from the ground. See DevilKuma's movie, titled
"Tribute to Yoshi". :) However, I consider it somewhat risky...

Yoshi's classic Manji Spin Slaps series... and I have the impression that it
has been strengthened since the last Tekken! (it's not that good like in
Soul Calibur 2, though... hey, Namco!!! I wanna SC2-like slaps and f,f+2! ^_^)

I use it in fact often! Especially a single d/b+2 slap or d/b+2,2 two slaps
are kinda deceptive! Single d/b+2 is safer and should be used against people
with great reflexes... if you want to trick them into parry. :) (expecting 
that they will try to interrupt you with low punch, which often is the case!)
d/b+2,2 as a parry set-up is used mainly against people who have worse 
reflexes (they must think a while to figure out which move Yoshi has just 
done, LOL... really!). The single d/b+2 on hit flows well together with ~b+1
Sword Sweep (you're already in FC position). Don't worry, it's rarely jabbed
out. (if you want to know why, see Sword Sweep table :)
(why the single slap is better? Because it suprises your opponent very much.
After a couple of spins they already know which move you performed and they
usually gain advantage... not all spins are guaranteed. But doing the Sword
Sweep after 3rd, 4th or 5th spin is also nice IF it hit your opponent!)

The other funny thing about d/b+2,~b+1 is that it has the blocking point! If
somebody attacks you with any move immediately after he blocks the spin, the
Sweep won't come off and Yoshi will block! (it's because the ~b input)
There's also a d/b+2~D/F+1 version, in which Yoshi does the automatic low 
parry before the sweep. :) Awesome! Anyway, both versions have a weak point
lasting about 10 frames, and it's the initial Sword Sweep animation. If your
opponent fits into it, you'll be jabbed out. But who cares? He must be really
lucky to do it, he just must know the timing. :) Not to mention if the spin
hit your opponent, you'll in 95% connect the Sword Sweep. 
If you expect somebody will do high jabs after your Manji Slaps, immediately
after finishing a command press u/f+3: it will awesomely duck high jabs and
juggle your opponent. It can be also done from the medium distance:
 - d/b+2~u/f+3
...if you expect your opponent will rush at you.
Much more safe if d/b+2, (b+)1+4. :) See below.

Another good thing is a single slap to SideStep. :) Sometimes your opponent
may try a high move, which will be sidestepped... but also a lot of mid moves
tend to whiff, and throws will whiff for sure! 
 - D/B+2~U  (Slap & SS :)
Unfortunately, you'll SS only towards the screen, which result in different
properties depending on which side of the screen you are (sometimes you SS
to opponent's left hand, sometimes to right...). Keep this in mind.
(of course you can do the Crouch Cancel and SS to the other side...
 - D/B+2~u/b~D for example
... but I do not recommend this to players just starting playing Yoshi)
After a successfull SS you can repeat D/B+2~U to mess around :), or just
d/b+1, Sword Sweep FC,D/F+1, Shrine Lift SS+2, Inner Palm SS+1 or Samurai 
Knee u/f+3. :) If you do it at the distance, your opponent will 99% whiff 
any of his attack! In case of fast, tracking characters such as Steve, it
is sometimes not enough. Specially for him, do the string:
 - D/B+2~U~b+3+4 (when facing right!!!)
Yeah, it evades just about anything! ^_^ 
Just note that it's not 100% safe, you count on suprise. :) 
Mix it up with other "after D/B+2" things!!! ^_^ But indeed, it's a great
"come to me" approach/evasive tool in the medium distance!!! Practice the
timing, your opponent must NOT attack during D/B+2 execution! O_O

Single D/B+2 to Bad Breath also brings best results against high jab-happy
players. It will duck all high moves easily!
D/B+2~D/B+1+2,any
It works also after a couple of spins. :) But single spin is most suprising :)

Starting Manji Slaps at the distance is also a good idea, because many times
your opponent may think you have finished and rush in... only to get hit with
your last spin (4th or 5th). At this point you not only closed the gap between
you and your opponent, but you gained advantage and can continue with a custom
string of your choice. The "Manji Slaps from distance" technique often 
succeeds if previously you sticked to simple d/b+2 or d/b+2,2 spins.
Single d/b+2 spin is also good in the distance to encourage your opponent to
do a long-reaching, slow-recovering move (like Paul's Deathfist). You can 
either block it and retaliate (with d/f+2), or... steal it :) Stealing Paul's
Deathfists is a pure FUN! (see VS Paul Strategies later :)

(Nearly) last word: remember that after the last spin Yoshi gets dizzy, ouch!
And another word: The spins can't be interrupted if they're blocked: opponent
will try to jab you out after you finish the spins. :) You can annoy him with
four spins on block, which he MUST block, and then try a low parry... :)

Keep in mind that it actually can be ducked! But it doesn't mean it's useless.
In fact I use this move about 1-3 times a round, if done correctly it's rarely 
ducked, and it's safe on block. The key to connect with the kick on CH is 
using "2" punches (right punches) from time to time. (just don't hold any 
direction unless it's "b" and if you dash forward, execute it b+2... or you
will get Ninja Blade Smash). After a while your opponent will get used to
your funny right jabs (well, they're not that "funny", their damage is 240% of
left jab, not to mention better reach! It's only 2 frames slower), and try to
attack just after it... JUST to score a 3 kick straight into his face. :) 
Yeah! A simple f+3,3 is guaranteed if you stunned somebody on CH :) It's
obviously not all what you can do, but it's the "lazybone", strong combo :)
CH 2,3 is NOT guaranteed... strange... (i've just checked it up, and it's not)
Anyway, if you connect 2 on CH, you'll 99% connect a 3 after it too... your 
opponent must press the "active guard" to block it just in time, which rarely
happens. To sum up: a great move, but, as always: use it with wisdom. :)
(P.S. It's more often ducked by Kazuya-like opponents, who has strong 
after-ducking game: beware! If Kazuya ducks your 2,3... it HURTS! ^_^)

Yoshi's classic ... if somebody frequently ducks 2,3, he'll surely block this,
which means absolutely NO GOOD for Yoshi :) A juggle? Sure... fortunately 
Kazuya won't nail you on his WS+2, and if he tries WS+4,4, last kick will
whiff (exploit it!), but anyway, everyone can parry it! ^_^
It's good in custom strings, on hit you usually can follow it up with WS+4, 
but I hardly ever use it... Paul's Reversed PDK is much better.

Great jugglestarter!!! It causes a flip, which means that you'll have to 
juggle differently after this on hit. :) The most damaging juggles I know are:
(all "lazybone" juggles, they're very easy :)

SS+2, f+1, d/f+3,1    [dmg 39 points]
SS+2, d/f+1,2,D/B+2,2 [dmg 39 ... but you recover faster. Chase your opp.!]
SS+2, d/f+1,1, (d+1)  [dmg 36+(8~10)]
etc, etc...
About the last combo... sometimes d/f+1,1,1 hits, but I prefer two Door 
Knocker hits, they're safer. d+1 is guaranteed after it, if opponent tries to
roll back, it hits not for 10, but for 8 points. If he tries any rising 
attack, he ends BACKTURNED... nice, isn't it? ^_^ (sounds like f,f+4? :)
This jugglestarter is just GREAT, you're pretty safe after it, it incredibly
ducks under high and even some mid attacks, has awesome reach, juggles
crouching opponents... it rocks! Use it! ^_^

Great move if used properly! But it follows the rule "big profit = high risk",
which means you have to be careful with this move. It works best after you 
Side Step any long-recovering move (like Paul's Deathfist), or just blocked
low recovering moves (further information in VS Strategies). After Sidestep
and f+2 on hit, you have the following thingie guaranteed:
~B+1, throw! (in this case: backthrow!)
It's cool, isnt it? SS, f+2, b+1, 2+4... But, as everything in Tekken 4, it's
not perfect. :) This combination doesn't work against Eddy, Christie and King.
(I don't know why, maybe they're too much hunch-backed? :P). A great plus is
the fact that against some characters you don't have to SS, you can unleash
this combo just in front of them (but if you're close enough). A nice example
is Kazuya... (more in VS Strategies). Sometimes after SS you'll get a 
sidethrow... but don't worry, after a little bit of practice, you'll see the
openings and estimate the distance correctly.
What else? If you think the distance is too big to do this combo (or if you
fight against characters who are hunch-backed too much :P), you have the
d/f+2 starter guaranteed! And here's a juggle (standard, from practice mode):

d/f+2, b+1,(1),1, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, f+3    [dmg 48, 60 points with f+2]... or:
d/f+2, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, b+1,(1),1, f+3    [heh heh, quite the same :)]

(Small note: second version is better if you noticed a wall ahead... :P)
You can experiment by yourself with spins and finishers, but I think it's 
the strongest combo after f+2, d/f+2. 

  command:       name:                    damage:           range:
 = ~D/B+2,2,2    Manji Spin Slaps         10,10,8           mmm 

And this is the extension of your choice if you want to be safe after blocked
f+2. It has been toned down, though... Yoshi used to do all 6 spins after f+2
or d/f+1,2 ... WFH? Naaaamcoooo! Would Yoshi be too strong with it? >_<
But anyway, it's great! If you want to close the gap between you and your 
opponent, it's even better than d/f+1,2~D/B+2,2. The f+2~D/B+2 can't be 
interrupted inbetween, (in fact all spins can't be interrupted), the first 
spin is the safest, and if the backhand hits, you still has some guarantees 
up your sleeve! Like this one which I often use:

f+2~D/B+2, u/f+4 

If f+2 connects, u/f+4 can't be escaped. ^_^ (can't be escaped... by most of
characters... in fact some of them can escape, but must know how :P Just
Xiaoyu is a nice example... hey, I won't tell you how can she escape, it's not
anti-Yoshi FAQ! ^_^) Just be sure you didn't do two spins. :) Did I mention 
the range of f+2? It's "medium", which is the awesome range as for a 
hand-attack! Great approach tool, indeed!

f+2~D/B+2, WS+2

Thanks to Mashter I have the pleasure to present you this extension. WS+2
Will juggle in this case and is pretty much guaranteed! (again, Xiaoyu can
escape it... yeah, she's the most "bugged" character in the game). You can do
spinning juggles like after any "in the back" juggle, for example:

(...) WS+2, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, b+1, f+3              [dmg 46]
(...) WS+2, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, b+1,(1),1, f,f+2      [dmg 46]

Anyway, it's very safe on block and you can use it as a set-up for damage...
As you get closer to your opponent, you can continue with our old, good Sword
Sweep FC,b+1 (or his D/F+1 version), or with just anything fast you want. :)
Just be cautious if D/B+2 whiffs (sometimes it does, e.g. if you started f+2
at the edge of range, or if you whiffed f+2 and your opponent did a backdash)
and if D/B+2 is blocked. As always. :) Anyway, it's such a fast move that it
often confuses your opponent. It also catches any possible rush-in that your
opponent may commit, especially the D/B+2,2 version. Well, just because it's
longer. :) Also, don't forget the low parry against any low jab abusers ^_^! 
You can press a parry after 1st or second spin, ... after 3rd you get dizzy.
The last word: you're most endangered during f+2 execution. Watch your 
opponent carefully not to be hit during the initial animation: f+2 takes time
to be executed, as you have probably judged from Frame Parameters.

A great move, much more safer on block than f+2 version, and also has some
guarantees on hit! Athough it is not counted as a combo, you can easily 
d/f+2 your opponent after it, and juggle him just as you do in case of f+2.
Damaging, huh? You can also u/f+4 your opponent, but what for if you have 
beloved basic uppercut guaranteed? :)
You may think: "OK, but I must be in BT position first!". Yeah, and that's why
Yoshi's Meditation is so precious! You can easily do SS+3+4 or just 3+4 and
press b+2 or f+2 to have Manji Backfist from BT! Isn't it great? Go to

This move can be delayed: f,f, n, f+2, which "dramatically" lengthens its hit
distance :) On CH Yoshi will go to the other side, slicing opponent's stomach.
Looks just GREAT! ^_^ The overall damage of this throw is 36 points, which is
quite a lot. This move is also Yoshi's juggle filler with the greatest reach.
On Normal Hit you're close to your opponent, with advantage, ready to begin
your custom string. It has only one disadvantage: On block expect to be 
punished with some quick jab series. Your opponent will be at the advantage,
and surely will begin his/her in-close strategies... it's not very nice. It's
best to do this move if you expect your opponent will rush at you, or you just
can punish slow-recovering moves and continue upclose with a custom string.

  command:        name:                      damage:           range:
= ~d+3+4        = Indian Sit (Yoga)          -10 points :)     --  
It's a show-off move and also a kind of "mercy" for your opponent since by 
doing this you decrease the throw's damage to 26 points. Even if you'll
hold any direction immediately after CH f,f+2, the damage will decrease.
That's why if you want to inflict maximum damage, just don't move your pad
for a second or two :)
P.S.1 You can't do anything besides stand up after this version of Yoga.
P.S.2 You can wait a second and Sit BT to gain life :P Looks similar.
P.S.3 Yoshi looks cool as he sits after this throw! And you're merciful! ^_^

Basic Uppercut in action! Although toned down (slightly smaller reach, and 
bigger disadvantage on block... which doesn't mean it's not safe! Still, no
jabs will reach you if it's blocked, it has only -4 frames of disadvantage if
blocked. It's like nothing :P You can even d/b+1 after it any rush in attempts
but be sure it will be a rush-in, not a quick series of jabs. Jabs just after
this move on block will connect if you try d/b+1, simple. But if your opponent
attacks a few frames too late, low punch will out poke him.), this move ROCKS 
and is, in my opinion, one of the best Yoshi's juggle starters! It still has 
great reach, dodges a lot of high moves (but be awared that due to jab's 
priority, you can be sometimes outpoked if you don't time the uppercut right)
and starts damaging juggles!
To list some...:

d/f+2, b+1,(1),(1),1, d/f+1,1,(1)  (+ d+1)   [dmg 35(44) (+ 8~12)]
d/f+2, b+1,(1),(1),1, b+1,1, b+1, f,f+2      [dmg 44]

d/f+2, U/F+4, 1, f,f+2                       [dmg 42]
etc, etc...
Well, I will come back to this topic in Advanced Strategy section. :) These
juggles are very easy and you should be able to do them after a few trials.
BASIC UPPERCUT ROCKS! Use it! ^_^ It's good not only as a move to use here and
there, but also it's used after opponent's whiff or even in custom strings.
To go back to these jabs... best evasive/ducking combination is (although
toned down since TTT):
 - b,b~d/f+2
That is: backdash to Uppercut. The distance from which you start this sequence
depends on opponent's jab reach, e.g. Paul has great reach whereas Julia has 
weaker reach... Another good evasive maneuver is SS~d/f+2 or b+3+4~d/f+2.
Anyway, the uppercut will duck under high jabs also upclose, BUT...
1. You must be in nose-to-nose area...
2. You have to time it perfectly.
Why, why single jabs have so good priority? Hitting with uppercut under a
bounch of jabs is in this Tekken very dangerous! >_<

Yoshi's best low move! It has incredible reach, juggles, hits grounded oppo-
nents... it's great! The only drawback is poor recovery time on block... 
anyway, if you know when and where to use this move, you will have it rarely
blocked. In custom strings it's not that good upclose since it takes some time
for this move to hit, but if you have pushed somebody back, you can go for it.
Also it's good after SideStep in the middle range:
SS~D/F+3 (just hold D/F a little bit longer)
It's best to SS to Yoshi's right (opponent's left) not to have it whiffed...
Anyway, it's very hard to SideStep this move, it tracks very well! 
Some juggles:
FC,d/f+3, WS+4, d/f+1,2              [dmg 34]
FC,d/f+3, WS+4, d/f+4                [dmg 31]

FC,d/f+3, u+1+2,n~u/f                [dmg 21]
etc, etc...
Well, if you hit somebody at the edge of the reach, it would be wise to do
another Sweep, because most of the combos may whiff :) In case of the first
combo, you can ~D/B+2,2 after it (approach) and begin Yoshi's FC/WS nastiness.

Yoshi's classic low spins. Work best in connection with b+1,1,1... and 
against certain characters! (like Xiaoyu in her Art of Phoenix... against Lei,
Eddy...). Each two spins combos together, it's best to do a Manji Rising Kick
(also called "Tree Falling Kick" :P) after connected two spins, your opponent
might try to block next spin, and get hit by this mid kick...
If you have it blocked, you have to guess if your opponent is advanced or not.
Advanced opponent will hit you anyway... well, read on:
   
   command:       name:                  damage:           range:
 = f+4          = Manji Rising Kick      12                m   
This kick is awesome: it's fast and hits MID. You can go for SS+1 or SS+2 
immediately after it (Sidestep to Yoshi's right/opponent's left!), it often
hits on CH if your opponent tries any move. Also, if you have Spinning Kicks
blocked, and you know your opponent is not advanced, you can go for it to be
safe, or even to knock your opponent down if he doesn't know how to block it.
    
 = d+3+4        = Indian Sit             --                --      
... and this is for advanced opponents. :) If you have Manji Kicks blocked,
go for it! Unless you want to get juggled... Nothing will save you from being
juggled but this move, even if you spin to diziness, Yoshi will be launched.
With this move, you'll be only hit by WS jugglestarter, fortunately no juggle
is possible after it. :) 

To sum up, two spins from the medium distance usually hit your opponent, plus
they're all guaranteed, and then you can chose to f+4 (on block you're safe,it
often hits opponents who expect more spins, especially because they don't know
that two spins are guaranteed and frantically try to block... :P) or Indian
Sir + extensions... Indian Sit after two spins on hit is in fact very safe:
you're out of d/b+1 range, and Paul/Heihachi won't hit you with their d+1,
because the spins moved you slightly to their left! 
Beware of reversals and buffer a chicken for f+4 if you expect it to be 
reversed... and do NOT do this against King, of course :)

Yoshi's new kick series... first kick has a nice recovery, you don't have to
finish it with the second if you expect somebody will block it. As written 
above, second kick can be only blocked, but if it is blocked, Yoshi suffers
serious disadvantage. Anyway, if you use:

   command:       name:                  damage:           range:
 = ~d+3+4        = Indian Sit             --                --  

... you'll sit after move. It's good if you know you will have the last kick
blocked: you won't be juggled! You can be only hit in the middle of sitting.
It can be also useful if you hit your opponent with the last kick only, you
can teleport behind and get a backthrow if your opponent tries any standing 
kick. 

Last kick of this series alone slightly juggles, you can do u+1+2~1+2 if you
are close enough. Just remember that this kick DOESN'T recover crouching! :)

The f+3 version of first kick does 28 points of damage, which is important in
Juggles, obviously. This version has slightly worse recovery time, [B Adv -7]
but still is quite safe. 
Any mixup? Eeehhh... The second kick can be blocked on reaction, on higher 
level of play it rarely connects, unless you really suprised somebody with it.
(for example: you did alone 3 all the round, and then switched to 3,3 over
lying opponent to trick him into the second kick as he stands up).
A little mix-up would be u/f+3 after 3 on block, against opponent who either 
ducks expecting 3 or wants to jab out any incoming "4" (Zig-Zag), adding that 
he has bad reflexes :P Also: read on, the "Zig-Zag" and "Zig-Roo Kick" tables.

Yoshi's classic kick series. It can be easily outpoked inbetween, that's why
it must be used only in specific situations:
- 3,4 over lying opponent, if you expect he'll stand up after whiffed 3 just 
to be slammed with powerful 4...
- If you have 3,4 jabbed inbetween, you can then try 3,3. It can't be jabbed!
But it works only versus opponents up to upper-intermediate level of play. :)
- 3,4 is great as a lazybone combo: if 3 resulted into a wall stun, 4 will
hit for some serious damage. (remember that the 3 kick sends your opponent
flying slightly to Yoshi's left! Important in a wall game!)
- 3,4 as a juggle finisher! Just examine the distance from Yoshi to the wall
ahead and do as much spins as you think that after a finisher 3,4 the second
hit will reach your opponent as he lands on the wall (feet in the air!). Only
in this situation it's guaranteed. But even if you have it blocked, you'll be
pushed backwards to safety. The only danger is walltech, but I assure you that
only very experienced opponents will escape this. If used at the first time,
it often suprises :) Moreover, it seems to be easier to pull off after
f+2, d/f+2, spins. Your opponent flies higher in the air, not to mention your
opponent must escape by holding B, not standard walltech. :) And even if he
does this "B" block, sometimes he won't manage to turn around in time... :)
The damage is HUGE! 82 (!!!) points for simple f+2, d/f+2, b+1, f+3~4!!!
Examine the spacing to use it well. :)
Sometimes in the rectangular arenas such as Hon Maru, after wallstun caused
by f+3 (for example), you can juggle your opponent a while and then land a
free f+3~4! Try this as you are in the middle of the shorter wall:
(when facing right) SSL, f+3, f+1, b+1, f+1, f+3~4
It's a wall stun caused by f+3 (due to SSL you are at an angle to the wall),
then f+1 juggles your opponent, and all the arts hits because as you do the
finishing 3, your opponent will land on the other wall scoring an inescapable
side-type stun... and will be hit with ~4. I like it, my little "done-during-
boredom" juggle. Try it! ^_^

If you don't want to do 3(wall stun), 4 all the time, you can jab the stunned
opponent and begin a juggle. It's quite useless to list all juggles you can
do, they depend on angle... it's more spontaneous juggling than guaranteed
stuff... OK, OK, I'll try to list some...

3(wall stun, forward type) f+1, b+1,1 b+1,1, f,f+4          [dmg 52]
etc, etc...
These are only examples, in fact sometimes none of these combos will fit...
and sometimes you'll encounter an opposite wall and juggle longer... :)

Well well, it can be in fact useful, it's better mix-up with 3,4 Zig Zag than 
with 3,3 Oni Kick Combo. Works even versus advanced opponents. As you had the
3,4 jabbed inbetween, you can go for it. It will duck under high jabs and
juggle! (see Kangaroo Kick juggles) It's better because the animation of
this version and 3,4 Zig Zag looks very similar (Yoshi stops for a moment).
BUT... there's no chance your opponent will hit you with high jabs. :)
Nice, nice... but use all three 3,3; 3,4 and 3,d/f+3+4 with wisdom. :) 
Also: as you keep being d/b+1'ed all over the time, just switch to:
3~d/f
It's the roundhouse and low parry. Simple as that, and you have a juggle! ^_^

Yoshi's newly gained jugglestarter ... and it's GREAT!!! Its only minuses are
poor recovery time if blocked and small reach. On the other hand, this move
has awesome priority, juggles crouching opponents and is Yoshi's fastest 
juggle starter! 
In fact it ducks under a lot of high attacks, but in case of jabs you must be
very careful. Best combination is "duck-knee":
D/B~u/f+3 or D/F~u/f+3
You duck first jab out of a series and then juggle your opponent under the 
rest. The similar effect you'll get if you use u/f+3 after any move that
recovers crouching, for example:
D/B+2~u/f+3
It ducks everything which hits the "high" range... just be sure your opponent
won't try d/b+1 instead of high jabs :) (remember: you have also a low parry)
And now some sample juggles:
u/f+3, f+1, b+1, d/f+1,1, (d+1)                   [dmg 33 (+8~10)]*
u/f+3, f+1, b+1,1, d/f+3,1                        [dmg 42]
u/f+3, f+1, b+1,1,(1),1, f+3                      [dmg 42]
u/f+3, f+1, b+1, f,f+3,3 (~d+3+4 to Indian Sit)   [dmg 40]
etc, etc... 
*(the sword slash after two Door Knocker hits cannot be escaped. This is true
in any juggle ended with Door Knocker. But d/f+1,1,1 d+1 is not guaranteed.)
And now the best part: Remember that...

    !!! SAMURAI KNEE IS GUARANTEED AFTER THE STANDARD LOW PARRY "D/F" !!!

You have to remember this: it's one of Yoshi's most feared weapons! No joking!

Well, I did the frame evaulation by myself, there are no detailed information
about this move.... but Sweeping Kick is worth listing because of its great
uses, especially as a poking tool... not only a poking tool, but also a
poking LOW tool, with great reach and priority, AND dodging capabilities! 
You suffer some disadvantage on block, but it rarely happens if you use this 
kick with wisdom. As always, don't become predictable. 
Don't forget that you can buffer it in ANY recovery time. :) Not only into
Yoshi's retracting time after a hit, but also into a recovery time if Yoshi
has just blocked opponent's move or even if he has just been hit! Examples:

Yoshi: 1~D/B+3 (buffered into the retracting time of 1 jab)
Opponent: 1,2; Yoshi: ~D/B+3 (buffered into recovery time of block or hit)

It's great in custom strings, and also as the oki-zeme tool. Use it! ^_^

Shark attack combo... last two hits combos together, second hit if not

whiffed... Second blow will NOT hit if you follow it with 3+4... it's not
the combo at all, even with CH... this move SUCKS! It can be interrupted at
any point! The only reason I gave it ** note instead of * is usefulness of
f,f+3+4 as a juggle ender on a slope. I never use it.
It was great in Tekken 3 / TTT after a backhand, since on CH all hits were
guaranteed... but I suppose Yoshi would be too good with this in Namco's
opinion... yeah, yeah... they're just wrong. Now it's useless...

In Tekken 4 Poison Wind also has its uses. Alone it jumps over most of moves
your opponent may throw at you, stomps grounded opponents, but has a big 
disadvantage if blocked. What makes it be very good are its follow-ups. :) 
   
   command:       name:                  damage:           range:
 = 1+2          = Flea                   20                {!}   
 = U+1+2        = Charged Flea           30                {!}
Flea is a great addition to Poison Wind series. It combos with u/f+3+4 no 
matter you hit standing or grounded opponent, and with the addition of Flea 
Charge (see Pogo Table below), it can inflict serious damage (up to 37 
points!). It's a great oki-zeme tool. (go to Oki-zeme Section for details)

 = 3+4          = Kangaroo Kick          30                m        
It's in fact very good! Your opponent won't manage to hit you with any high
jabs if u/f+3+4 is blocked: Yoshi will go under him and juggle! It's also
very nice if you hit a standing opponent with u/f+3+4, and follow it up
with this Kangaroo Kick: your opponent may think you are at serious 
disadvantage and attack: press low parry, because a low attack is usually
performed! (more guarantees after it). And you have a free juggle :)

 = d+3+4        = Indian Sit             --                --   
Great deception tool, it evades even more attacks than Roo Kick. You can
even do u/f+3+4, d+3+4 at the distance: it's in most cases safe! But 
remember to DO SOMETHING as your opponent rushes at you :) Teleport behind,
use Indian Moonsault slayer ... anything :) You'll see by yourself :)

 = b+1           = Stone Fist            2                 Sm   
   = 3+4          = Poison Wind          20                M

         = N             = Delayed Slice 15                {!}      #6 
... Yoshi's classic Poison Wind Extensions. After Stone Fists Yoshi is 
vulnerable, in general these extensions should be used as your opponent is on
the ground. u/f+3+4 stomps your opponent (or not, if he managed to roll, etc),
then b+1 lifts him slightly off the ground, and sometimes even a backflip 
connects for a nice combo. I would not recommend you sword slice unless you
fight against somebody who doesn't know what the Side step is. :) Also, big
Poison Wind hits RARELY, it must have a proper set-up... 
[ KYSG vid: Yoshi doing Law's Poison Arrow, step back, u/f+3+4 (whiff), b+1
(hits opponent on the ground and causes weird stun), 3+4 (hits!). Your enemy
must be lying head first/face down... well, it rarely happens... ]
A whole series is also a show-off and keep-a-pressure after any sweeping move
(Lunging Sweep, Sword Sweep...). You can jump over your opponent with u/f+3+4,
then b+1, and 4, which will chase standing opponent and sometimes juggle him
for more damage. Anyway, it's not recommended in a higher level of play, you
will be most likely sidestepped.
To sum up: my favourite extensions are Indian Sit, Roo Kick and Flea. ^_^

Yoshi's awesome stunning kick! It has MARVELLOUS reach and a very good
priority, it's Yoshi's main weapon! Not to mention acceptable disadvantage on
block (just "flash" [1+4] if you expect a throw and are too lazy to guess up
the escape :P). In general Yoshi's SS moves are all great. :)
You must only beware of characters with high-priority moves ducking high ones, 
like all Deathfists, WGFs, Heihachi's f,f+2, because it usually goes under 
your awesome kick. :). 
   
   command:         name:                damage:           range:
 = ~3+4           = Meditation           --                --
This is a very good choice if you want to do some very damaging combos after
SS+4 on CH. But beware: if your opponent expect this and will block it, you'll
be badly punished. 

Some combos to cheer you up: :)
CH SS+4~3+4, 3+4, b+1,1,(1),(1),1, f+3  [dmg 60, must be well-aligned]
CH SS+4~3+4, 3+4, f, f+1, d/f+3,1       [dmg 54, if opp. stays behind Yoshi]
CH SS+4~3+4, 3+4 BT 3                   [dmg 47, if opp. stays behind Yoshi]
CH SS+4, f+3,3 (~d+3+4 to Indian Sit)   [dmg 53, lazybone combo :)]
CH SS(L)+4, f+4,4,4                     [dmg 53, kinda tricky :)]
CH SS+4, dash, U+1+2~U,n,1+2            [dmg 52, see Pogo Charge tricks]  

In general the SS+4~3+4 combos depend on the alingment and most of them 
usually are done spontaneously. Is you SideStep to left, you'll most likely
do a "opponent stays behind version" (you have to press "f" to face him and
continue a combo), but it's not always the case. Also, with "big" opponents
you'll usually do a "opponent stays behind" combo, but again: it's not that
sure. :) With a little bit of practice, you'll predict which version will 
come judging from opponent's alignment after a CH hit, don't worry.
To sum up: GREAT KICK! Use it! ^_^

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yoshi's fubuki: the fastest knee attack in the game! You can delay it by
pressing f,f, n, f+4 (it also lengthens the knee's reach). Also, there's a 
funny cancel into Roo Kick: f,f+4~3. Looks cool, try it!
However, if you have this knee blocked, you're gone, flying and screaming
around :P (juggled by your opponent :). And, unlike in previous Tekkens, now
it can be easily Side Stepped if your opponent time his movement right... it
results into painful, inescapable backthrow. So how NOT to have it blocked?
You'll have to know when your opponent wants to attack you. It's quite easy to
spot (and hear :), so I think that after a little bit of practice, you'll have
it rarely blocked (Yoshi-masters really do NEVER have it blocked).
Just as your opponent moves forward and screams a battle cry, your speedy
Fubuki will stop him. This battle scream is important: sometimes a smart 
opponent may just rush in and stop: but if the character actually screams, it
means that it's not a fake: he/she really attacks. It's a big advantage.
It's nice to follow up these moves with fubuki:
Deathcopters, Sword Slices, Cyclone Lift, SS+1 and SS+4 on normal hit, Indian
Sit Moonsault Slayer, WS+4, d/f+4 on hit, ...etc, etc...
Just don't WS+4, f,f+4 immediately. These moves gain the required advantage to
see what your opponent is doing. Also, the fast unblockables are a kinda
psychological weapon, your opponent is usually anxious to pay you back, which
you can exploit... just don't become predictable, as always. :)
And what to do after it connects? :)
- if your opponent quickrolls, you have d+1 guaranteed. Nice, huh? :) You can
also try for free FC,b+1 or FC,D/F+1. It 99% hits!!!
- if he backrolls, you have u/f+3 guaranteed! (learned from TZ forums. Thanks
guys! CPU counts it even as a combo :P). But anyway, you can run up and do
Sword Sweep: many times it hits!
- if your opponent stays, you can d+1 or u/f+3+4,U+1+2~U,n,1+2 him :) Yeah!

Mawashigeri, Side Kick, or Saviour Boot: it's all about the same kick! Well,
it used to be marvellous (Tekken 3 maniac anybody?), now its "only" very good.
Heh heh, but "very good" still means "absolutely worth using" :) Now its
reach has increased (it was great in T3, poor in Tekken Tag, now again it's 
great:), the damage it inflicts is very good, it's very fast and retracts 
quite good (you're safe, but unable to continue fast custom string unless your
opponent is slow-reacting and doesn't know the power of jabs :). Basically
this move usually ends a custom string which destination was to put some
distance between you and your opponent. On hit Yoshi has advantage, exploit it
to get closer or to do a SS attack... or... well, think! ^_^
To sum up: this move is a great custom string tool as well as just a distant

Yoshi's classic three-kick series, now much faster and stronger! If the first
kick connects, the second is guaranteed. If the second kick is blocked, the
third cannot be ducked (it can be blocked, but cannot ducked. Opponent shows
his side to Yoshi - no guarantees, unfortunately). If the second kick connects
on CH, the third is guaranteed... So, it's a pretty nice thing, don't you 
think?  * = BUZZ! = ^_^*

If you input the command like: f+4,4,4, distance raises to farther medium, 
damage of the first kick increases to 20, and also causes KD if hits on CH...
These kicks are valuable juggle fillers, and also great attacks from the
medium distance. They're also good in custom strings.

that are obviously unblockable and certainly all guaranteed :P I love doing
a mix-up out of these combinations:

 - 4,4,2,2~D/F (low parry, u/f+3 juggle)
 - 4,4,2,2,4,4,1,1,1,1

The first mix-up is for people who just block everything and you're sure they
won't even try to duck under your kicks.
The second and third versions are for people who you think they can duck the 
third kick. If first "2" hits, the second is guaranteed and your opponent
lands backturned! The fun with this move is that it hits MID, not Smid, and so
it CAN'T be low-parried. Laugh at anybody who wants to parry it, LOL.
And now you have a killer guess-up: experienced opponents will most likely
go for low turning punch to stop your 10-string (any of the listed), and will
get low-parried and juggled! For the second time, you can continue with your
10-string (recommended the 10-hit one: after a low kick, all hits are 
guaranteed!), hah hah! The string actually can also be escaped later, but your
opponent must know how, and must be calm not to lose the moment. :) You risk 
only 10 points of damage, and you can gain over 50!
The 4,4 is rarely ducked under 2nd kick, your opponent must know Yoshimitsu
very well or has good memory to duck it quickly. BUT beware Kazuya-like
opponents with strong WS game: they'll hunt for every occasion to duck just
about anything they can, you can have your kicks ducked! Ouch, it hurts! ^_^
But anyway: this mix-up rocks! As I told you at the beginning, you have to
calculate the risk with Yoshi. So the risk is: 10 points of damage. And the 
gain is: 50 points taken from your opponent. WORTH trying! ^_^
As for strings ended with single Sword Stab, Sword Spin and Cartwheel... they
are not that good. Both sword Stab and Sword Spin can be outpoked, and 
Cartwheel is nor guaranteed. Anyway, Sword Stab can be used as another choice
in the mix-up above for opponents who wisely will try to retreat out of the
string's range after being hit by (4,4),2,2... it's very good in this 
situation, but I rarely use it. 
Last word: if 4,4, actually hit your opponent, he'll most likely block 2,2.
Remember it. After 2,2 on block, Yoshi suffers disadvantage. :) 
This move rocks! The mix-up rocks, too! Near the wall it's delicious: if you
put a pressure on your opponent, he'll make mistakes. Which Yoshi exploits! :)

Yoshi's strongest jugglestarter! It awesomely ducks under high moves, damages
your opponent for 30 points and juggles him high in the air. However, it has
a bad recovery time if blocked. You have to time it right not to have it 
defended. If you think your opponent will attack with a string of high jabs,
go for it for massive juggle damage! One more thing: if you fight against 
small characters like Xiaoyu, sometimes Yoshi won't be able to turn around due
to camera chaos... so chose the juggles that don't require turn around.

As you are near the wall and expect push/high jabs, you can go for Roo Kick.
It will obviously duck under high jabs or push attempt and juggle!
Here's the desired sequence of spins which you can use:
4~3, b+1,1, b+1,1,1,1,1,(1)                   [dmg~78]
You can spin to diziness, or... many times it happens that your opponent will
fly somewhere to the left or right. It's often the case if you're at an angle
to the wall. Be ready to cut the second sequence of spins short and start 
another one with a finisher... it requires a lot of practice, it's very
spontaneous. You can juggle even for 120 points of damage in this way! It's 
not only the case with Roo Kick, but also with other juggle starters. :)
And always be awared that you risk doing the Kangaroo Kick... well... ^_^

Yoshi's classic jumping kick, it has great priority and hits mid! It also 
jumps over low moves. Be careful with u/f+4 version, though: it has poor 
recovery time. u+4 is slightly more safe, and the safest is u/b+4, which I use
as a keep-away move and a nice, "retreat" addition to custom strings. The
"run-away" u/b+4 version has weaker damage (17 points) due to its excellent
uses. It will hit any incoming move, and at the same time Yoshi will jump
backwards... GREAT! Use it, especially u/b+4.

It's Yoshi's "confusing" move... well... it has some uses, but use it with
wisdom! Experienced opponents will jab you in the back and juggle exploiting
the advantage... It's best used over lying opponents. You can then press a
throw, BT d+1 or BT Hopkick against standing opponent, or even jump above him
to the other side. In this case this move is nice.
But I advise you not to try it frequently versus advanced opponents. :) And in
general don't use it too often, it's better not to make your opponents 
familiar with the animation. Remember that you have also a Double Suicide, 
which must, MUST suprise your opponent. It suprises him best if you don't do
the move too often. Simple and true.

your opponent is backturned, near the wall... isn't it a great position to 
keep a pressure? Just be cautious, BT moves have usually a good priority.

Yoshi's old-school unblockable! It's slow like ****, but also damages like ***
and SOMETIMES evades high attacks. I don't know why only "sometimes", I'll
check it up. :) It's best used if:
 - you expect somebody will soon get up from the ground
 - ...and will end up with a wall behind his/her back. :) The greatest
would be a corner, but well... :) 
You can plan your attack just to have this situation. For example:

1.) Juggle your opponent as far as you think that after a backroll opponent 
will still touch the wall, use a fast-recovering finisher (e.g. d/f+3), and 
as soon as your opponent touches the ground, go for b,b+1. But he must touch 
the ground or the Sword won't track him. Many times it connects. :) 
2.) Remembering that 3 Oni Kick knocks opponent down and slightly to Yoshi's
left, (you can reduce it by Side Stepping to Yoshi's left) go for it at the 
distance about two lying opponents from the wall (can be slightly more), and 
follow it up with b,b+1. Only wise opponents will stay still or do a f+1+2 
standing move. You cannot be hit with any roll forward to rising kick, it 
also cannot be backrolled (a wall behind opponent's back... but even without
a wall it's very difficult to backdash! This move is long-reaching as h***!)
It can be sidestepped with quick SS, though, but well, your opponent can
make mistakes seeing Yoshi's sword pointing at him continuously. :)
At the second time, if you're sure your opponent will stay still, go for
the short Deathcopter. Oooh! ^_^ Yoshi and his powerful guess-up!

There are much more similar situations... I think you can already imagine. :)
The drawback is that you count mainly on opponent's suprise and shock after
realizing that there's no escape. If your opponent is cold-minded, he may 
manage to rush in and strike for serious damage, though... (but he must be
really quick with this! ^_^) That's why you have to use a proper set-up for 
this move. It has to be a spurise! Experiment, practice! ^_^

Yoshi's ever great Sword Spin! This unblockable rocks near the wall as your
opponent Techrolls to escape juggle hits. It also is good over lying opponents
because you can catch them as they stand up. You have two versions os this
Spin: a long one (b,b+1~1), and a short one (b,b+1~1, b,b). You can randomly
use both of them over lying opponents, it brings awesome results! Also, just
before your opponent, you can play this guess-up. Doing longer version for
opponents who rush in to punish you is a great fun. :) But beware: the 
recovery time in case of longer version is poor. :)
Not only this is awesome: the cancelled Sword Spin b,b+1~1,b,b can hit your 
opponent twice! It can be done under two conditions:
 - You did the Sword Spin in the correct time/opponent delayed his stand up, 
or quick rolled just to be hit with the spin;
 - Your opponent is close to Yoshi's sword-wielding hand (e.g. he quick rolled
to Yoshi's left...)
This double sword hit can be done in various situations, I'll give you some:
1. Opponent escaped your spinning juggle hits near the wall to Yoshi's left,
and you performed the Sword Spin... hits twice in most cases.
2. You pushed somebody to the wall, jab him with 1 jabs for some time, and as
he tries to duck, you nail him on u/b+4 (wall stun). Then you immediately do
Sword Spin & Cancel. If your opponent does a quick-roll to Yoshi's left, he
will get hit twice. If to Yoshi's right: once. :)
3. You whiffed some spins in a juggle on purpose, allowing your opponent to
quickroll... just to be hit by your sword. ^_^ If he Quickrolls to Yoshi's 
left, he'll get hit twice, in most cases.
To sum up: use it! It's one of Yoshi's greatest unblockable attacks, go for
it in various situations! Maybe you'll discover a nice set-up or follow-up? :)

Yoshi's new unblockable... decent one. It can be evaded both by Side Step and
just duck... it's mainly a taunting move, I think. :) You are at the 
disadvantage even if you actually hit with it, do not attack! Your best is to
Side Step or duck after this move. It also approaches your opponent quickly,
but well... I hardly ever use it because of it's slow wind-up and recovery.

Yoshi's evasive maneuver: GREAT! Just MARVELLOUS! Now it's reach has increased
so always be ready for a juggle :) These "at the edge" juggles are in fact
one of the most damaging! ^_^ If it hits upclose, you also can do something
nice and energy bar-devastating. :)
Some juggles:

1. UPCLOSE
D/B+1+2~any, D/B+3,3,(3),3, f+4                 [dmg 42]
D/B+1+2~any, f,f~U+1+2~U,n, 1+2                 [dmg 25 + 15~27, depends]

2. FAR
D/B+1+2~any, f+3,3                              [dmg 53, VERY far]
D/B+1+2~any, f+1, b+1,1,(1),1, f+3              [dmg 52]
D/B+1+2~any, u/f+1+2~D                          [dmg 25 + 25, VERY far]
D/B+1+2~any, f+1, b+1, d/f+3,1                  [dmg 48]
D/B+1+2~any, f,f~U+1+2~U,n, 1+2                 [dmg 25 + 15~27, depends]
D/B+1+2~any, u/f+3+4, U+1+2, 1+2                [dmg 40 or more]

The D/B+1+2 evades ALL high attacks and sometimes even some mid (mainly 
punches... but I think it's rather a bug in the game: don't try it, it's not 
always the case :P), even the animation of spitting a puff of smoke still
evades high attacks! So it's a great weapon if you expect high jabs, throws or
just about anything that hits high. :) 
You can throw in a random Bad Breath here and there, and your opponent just
can't do anything. :) If he's wise, he'll duck just in case. The reach may
suprise even experienced players. The puff of smoke stops everything, even a
powerful jumping attack, it's like a shield for Yoshi. Be ready for Fubuki
[f,f+4] if you see that your opponent wants to attack you. Most common are
mid-hitting, long reaching attacks or low strikes, the safest choice would be
to watch carefully and block/parry any incoming attack... or flash if you are
too lazy (yeah, flash stops even low attacks, but must be timed precisely).
It's always an advantage, it's YOU who encouraged your opponent to attack,
you expect mainly a long-reaching moves or just a rush-in (which you can poke
out with d/b+1 or strike away with u/b+4... or... experiment! ^_^). Yeah, and
that's it! Bad Breath is indeed Yoshi's great weapon!
What else? It can be ducked, but "so what", I ask? It's safe, I have never 
been juggled or even hit after execution. The only danger is incorrect use of
it... sometimes you'll get hit by a mid strike, expecting a high one... but 
it's worth trying because of the damage it inflicts!
And... you can frustrate your opponent doing this at the distance, because it
is very risky to try any approach while Yoshi spits the poisonous fumes...
It can be used as a nice wake-up over lying opponents (sometimes they get up
too early... heh heh...:), and against wall-techroll... (if your opponent
was suprised very much and forgot that there is such a command like D/B... :)
To sum up: GREAT WEAPON, use it! And... Yoshi looks cool while doing it :)

Yoshi's classic aerial unblockable... now it's much toned down. Well, it can
be easily spotted and Side Stepped... It's worth trying only as a powerful
juggle filler/finisher (like in your Kangaroo Kick or e.g. Stolen Hwoarang's
juggling kick...) and sometimes against opponents who are trapped in the 
corner/near a wall. It can be also a backroll punisher, but well... only if
you suprised your opponent, because most of your opponents will SS this.

Yoshi's classic since Tekken 3: Wood Chopper combo, now your second most 
powerful juggle finisher and in general a nice attack :) If first kick hits, 
the sword is guaranteed. (anyway, you're openned for fast retaliation even if 
the sword hits) If you have the kick blocked, you'll be most likely jabbed out
or even Side Stepped and juggled. The kick itself recovers crouching, which
makes it a decent approach tool... (only on hit you are at the advantage, and
the kick even as a frontal attack is slow...). But if it hits, you land just
in front of your opponent in FC mode, with the advantage, ready for FC/WS
Yoshi's nastiness. :) I recommend you Sword Sweep (often hits! It's a very 
old, good technique that almost everyone knows...), Rainbow Drop throw or just
d/b+1 and a custom string of your choice. Experiment! It's a good move!

Yoshi's low unblockable maneuver: GREAT! In previous Tekkens I didn't pay
much attention to this move: now it seems that it's one of Yoshi's main 
weapons! C'mon, only Heihachi can reverse it with little damage to Yoshi, for
others it's inescapable once started. You can continue it with a combo, from 
more difficult but very damaging to decent ones, but very easy. It's also an
UNBLOCKABLE! It looks cool! Hits low! And due to a tiny step to Yoshi's right,
it evades some moves! (like e.g. low jabs, some mid moves... I even managed to
evade Jin's 1,2,3 by ducking 1,2 and executing a Sword Sweep, which made the
3 kick whiff and tripped Jin! O_O). Also, look at the damage: it's good! And
with the following combos it's even more damaging:

FC, B_D/F+1, d/f+1,1,1~D/B+3 (hard!**)                         [dmg 45 + 12]
FC, B_D/F+1, f+3,3 (tricky! works best on a slope)             [dmg 48]
FC, B_D/F+1 (at the edge of reach) u/f+3+4, 1+2, 1+2           [dmg 20 + 15]
FC, B_D/F+1, f,f+4                                             [dmg 32]
FC, B_D/F+1, guess up u/f,n,d+3 or u/f,n,d+4                   [dmg~45]

(** Some characters eat this easily, some not... Check it out! And: sometimes
it's better to do d/f+1,1 instead of d/f+1,1,1. I use the two-hits version.)

I have told you already many set-ups of this move... (because due to a semi
fast windup time it has to have a set-up). It can be used after most of moves
that recover crouching, in custom strings as an unblockable finisher, after
juggles as you chase your opponent and don't give him any time to think, or 
after a successful Sidestep, after you duck any high move, after you block
any low move and you're not sure if FC,d/f+3 fits into recovery time, at the
beginnig of the round, after a low parry if you got bored with u/f+3...
It flows well together with d/b+1 as well :) It can be only backdashed ot hit
with a fast mid move, or sometimes backdashed... you count on suprise!
 - d/b+1 ,n, b+1 (you are in FC mode after d/b+1)
It has thousands of uses! And the most important thing for every Yoshi player:
you have to, you MUST learn how to use this move! It's Yoshi's feared weapon!
But if you use it not in time, you'll be punished for sure.

Harakiri: as the name says, Yoshi stabs himself in the stomach. Well, heh heh.
If you don't want your opponent to finish you, go for this move. :P Anyway, it
is also a strong juggle finisher after Kangaroo Kick and 3+4, 3+4 Manji 
Backflip, but you must be careful with evaluating the level of your and 
opponent's lifebar. :)

It's da-ma-ging! Sometimes you can suprise the opponent and go for this move 
if he's near the wall (works best after f+2). It can take up to 120 points of
damage with wall hits!!! But don't forget Yoshi also gets hurt...
Moreover, try this combo:
3+4, 3+4 (hit, wall stun), d+1+4~B+1                  [dmg 83]
You have a plenty of time to see if the Backflip caused a stun... this little
combo looks cool and is inescapable. Try it! ^_^

Yoshi's double suicide: great move in Tekken 4, indeed! But still it's risky.
I recommend you to hunt for this move just after your opponent lost a half of
his/her lifebar: experienced players will expect you to do a suicide if your
own lifebar is very low or if their lifebar is also low... don't wait till
the very end. BUT, in fact, if you and your opponent have the same lifebar
level and it's a very low one, he/she might be afraid of losing and try to 
block any attack you want to throw in... thus eating a Suicide for goodbye. :)
It can be Side Stepped or just backdashed, be sure to have this beloved 
"element of suprise" up your sleeve. :) Personally I found out that it's best
used after a juggle, as you chase your opponent. Especially works near walls.
Remember these sample situations (in brackets: optional input):
1.) Juggle, (Sidestep), rush in, (Sidestep), Suicide.
2.) Low trip (FC,d/f+3), rush in, (Sidestep), Suicide.
3.) Sword Sweep~f,f+4, rush in, (Sidestep), Suicide....etc.
Also, the Sidestep addition makes it difficult for your opponent to notice the
approach animation. Yoshi sways during SS animation, and the Suicide looks 
kinda similar to dash or SS... approaching your opponent with fast SS and
dashes and ended with a Suicide will bring nice results!

 = Double Suicide      f,F           100            !         ** 
To be honest, I have never used it in Tekken 4. Well, most of the time I
connect the first suicide... it can be good if your opponent rushes in to 
punish your whiffed first suicide... but well... you have to have iron nerves
and a lot of lifebar to do this. (a lot of a lifebar to afford a suicide whiff
and iron nerves because the second suicide is the instant kill for Yoshi!)

To sum up: this suicide saved my Yoshi's *** many times! Use it, experiment!

Yoshi's standard sword slash: awesome move!!! It has incredible reach, hits
grounded opponents and has little disadvantage after hit (you can hunt for
Fubuki f,f+4 after it on any rush-in). It has only one disadvantage: it can
be Side Stepped or (rarely) backdashed, and has kinda slow windup time... but
if you time it right, it will always hit. :)

After 3rd hop you score a KD on hit... but I'll give you 100 dollars if you
hit somebody with this in a high level of play :) It should be like in SC, 
heh heh! 100 damage just after 3rd hop! ^_^ And a possibility to strike 
whenever you want... not like in Tekken, where you have each strike points
coded... And hitting somebody with the last hop never happens, unless you're
fighting against an idiot or a person who's afraid of Yoshi. ^_^

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rating depends on version: for the longest Deathcopter it's *, for 
Deathcopter Slash it's ****, and for the Deathcopter Trick it's ***. 
Deathcopter Slash is the best in my opinion, there are two points where you
can cut the animation short, which can chase your opponent whenever he choses
to backdash...:

 = Deathcopter Slash    ~d / ~N, d      25_30       {!}      

It's the most useful version! The [F hit] = 55 or 83 (depends on how fast you
cancelled the Flying animation), and the advantage on hit is +4 frames.
Great uses, it flows well together with any move pushing your opponent back,
can be used as a great oki-zeme tool, especially near walls...
On higher level of play you can have this Side Stepped, but well, it sometimes
hits even SS if it's to the wrong side and not in time. But the double SS will
always make it whiff. Also, you can be jabbed out in the air by experienced 
players... but here you go with your set-ups. You can try it whenever your 
opponent is on the ground, especially after he whiffs the standing kick. 
Experiment! Personally, I use it quite often, especially after Pogo Combos.

 = Deathcopter Trick    ~B              35          {!} 
   
[F Hit] = 93, the advantages on block, hit, CH are all -8 frames... You risk
that the opponent may backdash at the edge of the range and Yoshi will end 
back facing his opponent... But if you time it right, it can be useful. :)
E.g after throws... sometimes your enemy won't double backdash, but backdash
and SS. If he does it to the wrong side, the Deathcopter Trick will hit him.
I use it from time to time... It suprises your opponent if you use it rarely.
If he gets used to it, you may have some troubles. ^_^ Anyway, experiment!

Yoshi's unblockable juggle starter... but it's relatively slow and juggles 
only on Clean Hit... well, I rarely use this move, my opponents often punish
me in the middle of this... but it can be a great oki-zeme tool, which will
juggle in case your opponent choses to stand up :) You're also safe after it.
Also, I don't know if you noticed it, but you'll RARELY get a Clean hit if
Yoshi stands on the left side of the screen (facing right)!!! But he'll juggle
easily if he stands on the right side of the screen, facing left, if only he
comes close enough. That's in fact WEIRD!!! It's another Tekken bug, I think.
Tested on USA version of Tekken 4.
sample juggle:
Clean hit d+1+2, f+1, b+1, d/f+3,1              [dmg 41]
(and other juggles, similar to those after SS+1)
I advise you to do a simple jab, though... this move is bugged, rarely juggles
and in fact it's difficult to do any juggle after it. 
I wonder what's this move really for. For fun? Because Soul Calibur Yoshi has
it? Hah hah, but it's weak, it's bugged as hell... it's frustrating! I wish 
Yoshi had a better move coded as d+1+2. This one is just plain ridiculous.

Yoshi's ultimate Shield and also a great tool to raise Yoshi's number of 
techniques :P It's cool and can be really dangerous... but I'm a great fan of
the older version of Yoshimitsu Flash. The older version was monstrous, was
DA-MA-GING, was ultra fast and Yoshi's main weapon in nose-to-nose and close
fighting area. Now...? Well, it doesn't do any damage at all... (unless you
do it near the wall, but 3 points of damage is... heh heh... what's this? :)
It's still ultra-fast and stops any opponents attack or even move close to
Yoshi. (the ultimate throw repellent, huh? ^_^). If it's the attack that Namco
think is worth stealing (*irony*... Yoshi can't steal all special attacks...
shame, shame!!!), Yoshi learns it. You can recognize it, because Yoshi's sword
starts to shine red. Then you can unleash the stolen technique by pressing
1+4 again. Note that you don't have to be in touch with your opponent to
steal a move. You can be far away. Also, you'll steal a move even if you 
actually get hit by it... which often happens because of some moves' priority.
My impression... this move was made in a great hurry, I suppose... it can't be
done in BT position (back facing opponent), unlike Yoshi's standard shield 
1+2+3. OK, it can be buffered, but this is not it. Yoshi's Pogo and Indian Sit
can be done backwards, even without buffering.
Many times you'll steal a move and don't even know what you've just stolen.
But your OPPONENT will know it! I mean: HEY!? Shouldn't it be the other way
round?! I want the return of the old flash, even if the damage were weakened!
I wish Yoshi's QCF+2 throw has the stealing properties, like in Soul Calibur.
But it would be slightly different: what if you could enter a command during
the throw's execution that you would want Yoshi to learn? (and input 2+3 to 
unleash the move, for example) It would be fantastic! But these are only my 
Tekken dreams. ^_^
To turn to this stealing stuff... I think it's useless to list here the moves
Yoshi can steal... it's all about your own experience with the flash. You'll
have to check it out by yourself. Of course it would be best to steal the 
most useful moves, like Paul's Deathfist or Kazuya's EWGF... juggles which
use such moves are the coolest around, you'll find a lot of movies with such
juggles. Go to Yoshimitsu Obsession Team or to Tekken Zaibatsu to see them. :)
Also, knowing opponent's frame data will also be very helpful. You can e.g.
punish Paul's second Deathfist on block with your stolen Deathfist to laugh
at him... you'll know what juggles will fit after what stolen juggle starter,
or you'll know what juggle finisher will match after which juggle...
Yoshi player MUST have a complex knowledge about all characters in the game.
It will make his life easier. :)

...

Anyway... I don't like the idea of stealing moves... not using the flash! >_<
Yoshi should be great without it. >_< *sigh...*

What can I say... it's the remaining from the past, used mainly as a taunt...
Yoshi can't move from Yoga anywhere, also he doesn't track his enemy... he 
just sits in the spot. Of course you can stop holding "D" to switch to the
Healing mode, and also press 3+4 to go to Indian Levitation move... not
to mention just stand up. :) Pretty useless... Yoshi has better taunts is his
Levitation stance, I assure you :)
There's but only one PRO: in Yoga stance Yoshi dodges a lot more attacks than
in the Healing mode! So if you just used Indian Sit to dodge an attack, you
better hold ~D after d+3+4 command :) You have better chances the move will
miss, and then you can either switch to ~N mode or just stand up :)

that damage himself that he must heal himself. ^_^ Also, it's one of his main

heh heh heh :) Every bounce equals one jab, if you do e.g. three bounces after
a simple juggle:
d/f+2, f+1, b+1, f+3,3~d+3+4 [ automatically enters Indian Sit ]
...You'll survive a 15-point blow more! ^_^ (or three jabs more :)
Use this, especially against a turtle-style players. :) Wo hah hah, I even

Well... Yoshi nicely levitates over the ground :) You can press any direction
while still holding 3+4 to move. Yoshi can also unleash some Levitation
"one-motion taunts": just press one of the following buttons and tap any 
direction:
 = 1, any direction (you still hold 3+4) - Yoshi will laugh!
 = 2, any direction (=||=) - Yoshi says "jigajisan!" (meaning: "self-praise")
 = 1+2, any dir. (=||=) - Yoshi also will say something. :) (can't understand)
If you tap the direction frequently, you'll cancel the taunt in a funny way...
for example:
[3+4], 1, f~f~f, f,N... will result into "Wo-wo-wo hah! Wo hah hah hah hah!
[3+4], 2, f~f, f,n, f,N... will result into "Ji-ji-jiga! Jigaji! Jigajisan!"
Funny, neh? To cancel the actual taunt and chose the other one, just hold the 
direction a little bit longer. 
You can also release 3 or 4 button (Yoshi will switch to Yoga-like stance)
and press each taunt button. Yoshi will say it and be ready for next command.
Of course you also can push the button repeatedly... :)
Release 3+4 and joystick to neutral position to swith to Healing Mode... [~N ]

Yoshi's classic! ^_^ He will teleport behind your opponent if only you're
close enough :) And after it you gain the most desired positioning: BEHIND!
Oh yeah! ^_^ Depending on what your opponent did and how far you are from him,
you can hit for free with whatever you want, starting with mostly guaranteed
f,f+4 Fubuki, ending with backthrow or d/f+2 "in the back" damaging juggle...
Use it whenever you think it may succeed! And also whenever you opponent 
expects more a Indian Sit follow-up than a Teleport behind...
If you teleported close to your opponent and he has just recovered, press a
low parry, because most likely your opponent will try a low punch to stop any
possible blow from your side. :) Only sometimes they try a hopkick (it's slow)
or a midkick (only a few characters have it, like Lei Wulong, Ling Xiaoyu).
Just don't become predictable, a hopkick may come in the time being!
One more thing: three steps away from the opponent, Yoshi will not teleport
anywhere, he'll just appear in the spot, backturned. It's not very good for
you, obviously :) Remember that you can press d+3+4 again to Sit backwards
(and so you can escape e.g. a Deathfist), or Spin away D/B+2,2... (but it's
much more risky)... anyway, I'm rarely attacked even if I'm backturned ...
Well, Yoshi has a strong BT-game :)

Yoshi's new unblockable, and a very good one! It's almost unstoppable if your 
opponent is close to you. Only sometimes he can jab you out of this and begin
a custom juggle... but it rarely happens! Also, after any Pogo Combo, as you
enter Indian Sit after Pogo Rush, you can freely go for it with great chances
it will connect. 15 of damage more, and NO disadvantage! Not to mention you
have just approached your opponent and you can begin a custom string of your
choice. ^_^ That's why the rating is so high :)

Another Indian Sit extension, and also a good one. :) You can suprise your 
opponent with this move, and follow it up immediately with Sword Sweep ~D/F+1
(you're already in FC position) before he regains controll over his mind ^_^
Well, the strange thing with this move is that if your opponent does any 
rush-in move or even movement, Yoshi won't do Manji Spin Slaps, but a teleport
behind... and he will be in BT (backturned) position! Always be ready for this
possibility and, depending on the distance, use this position to mess around.
^_^ You can follow up this BT teleport by jumping hopkick backwards [ U/B+4 ],
Jumping low kick backwards [ U/B, N, 3 - for bigger distances ], or even do
just a show-off and spin away :) [ D/F+2,2,2... remember you're in BT! ^_^ ]

Another Yoshi's new Indian Sit extension, and a VERY good one! First some of
its properties: well, both moves hit mid, both of them combos together, if
first hit misses, the second causes a high lift (JG). If the Dive Bomb is not
followed by Roo Kick, it hits crouching/grounded opponents... (so if you press
3~3+4, the first kick can be ducked... looks strange, but anyway...)
Why Whiff Recovery "depends"? Well, Yoshi travels a long distance doing this
move, if your opponent SideStepped the initial ~3, you'll recover before he'll
come to you and TRY to punish you. ^_^ Sounds like BT kick or hopkick? ^_^
Yeah! Personally, I use it VERY often! But it MUSN'T be 3, 3+4, it would
recover too late. Just 3 somewhere in the space, and watch your opponent :)
You must be sure that your opponent will SS it, though.
Anyway, mixing 3 and 3,3+4 is also a good idea even if directly blocked. Only
an opponent who knows exactly each animation will tell one move from another,
and so by doing only 3 you'll sometimes win a safety. On the other hand, as
you become predictable with this move, do again 3,3+4 and watch your opponent
being nailed on 3+4 Roo Kick for massive juggle damage. ^_^ I recommend you:
u+1+2~U, 1+2, f,f+4 ... a nice 65-point juggle.
It's a Pogo-Charged juggle, details will be listed in "Pogo Stance" analyzis.

And now I discovered something nice!
FC,d/f+3, u+1+2~d+3+4~3
The Indian Sit Dive Bomb is GUARANTEED on opponent's backroll after Pogo hits!
A very nice and flashy combo, suprise with it your opponent! ^_^

Roo Kick from Indian Sit is just what it sounds like: a Roo Kick from Indian
Sit. :P OK, OK... I'm getting ironic :) maybe because it's high time to go
to bed and sweet dream :) Well, it dodges a lot of things, but I rarely use 
it. It's in my opinion SO MUCH visible and predictable! And it can be jabbed
out just like the Indian Sit, so it's pretty much a risky move...
I can list only one situation when you can use this: if your opponent tricks 
you into teleport backwards (by dashing and quickly backdashing so you land
backturned), you can feast him with 4 Roo Kick as he rushes again to punish
your possible missed teleport... I used it many times in this situation. But
anyway, I think it's a risky move.

A word to finish the Indian Sit Stance table: you cancel this stance just by
pressing "u" command, heh heh... just in case... ^_^

Short description of this Stance:
Yoshi stands on his sword and perfectly balances his body not to fall down. :)
It used to be a powerful juggle filler, now... it depends on your alignment,
manual skills and... opponent's weight! Many moves arrived to make Yoshi be
more mobile, but still Flea is a risky stance to use just in front of your
opponent. It's frustrating... looks like all these disadvantages were added
unneccessarily... I mean mainly the hops: OK, the disadvantage should be there
but ONLY in case of next hop: buffered duck or Pogo SS should be able to
be unleashed just after the hop! It would ease Yoshi's life very much. Even
during duck and Pogo SS he's vulnerable, after all... and after a hop: he's
EXTREMELY vulnerable. It's my little suggestion for Tekken creators. :)

Yoshi enters the "Sword Pogo" (Flea) Stance...
First, let me explain Pogo "stages", so to speak. Yoshi's sword is not always
active. Probably you sometimes wondered "why the hell it didn't hit him". ^_^ 
 1. 1+2~N - you enter Pogo, doing nothing: the sword is active. 
 2. You hit someone while on the sword: the sword is NOT active after hit! 
    Even if somebody runs straight into the sword, it won't hit. Do a little 
    experiment:
 - enter the Pogo stance, 
 - place your opponent directly next to Yoshi and press any jab [ 1 or 2 ], or
   just low sweep the Pogo :), 
 - Yoshi's opponent obviously gets hit, 
 - now rush to Yoshi again and repeat the jab: now Yoshi gets hit! You can 
   even try to low sweep Yoshi while Pogo is inactive, it will look funny! 

But it doesn't mean you cannot do any Pogo command while Pogo is inactive :).
Pogo Run can still hit as well as Pogo Jump...etc. 

That's why I play Yoshi in buggy outfit in Tekken 4: If he flutters his wings
after hit, it means that Pogo is not active. And anyway, he looks more funny
and seems to be more "solid" than red-haired Yoshi... Black colour only makes
him look like a thin twiggy, which usually doesn't scare an opponent. :)

 3. 1+2~U - I call it Pogo Charge: the sword is active, yeah! It takes a huge
30 points if hits. And that's not all! You cancell the charge by either ~N or
u/f~f, or any Pogo command... AND THE CANCEL ALSO HITS FOR ABOUT 20 POINTS! 
It has TONS of uses, for example: in some most damaging Yoshi's combos ^_^. 
Oh, and after you cancel the Charge, Pogo is of course active. By the way: 
during charge Yoshi also flutters his wings, but this time it means he's 
charging. :) 
I will list for you some sample charge uses:

Pogo Charge - Cancel combos are the most damaging combos I ever experienced.
No wonder Pogo is toned down in Tekken 4, but I would be very happy if in 
next Tekken walls didn't do any damage, but the power of Pogo would return!
To be honest, Charge was present even in Tekken 3, but now I'm much more 
concerned with Tekken Tag and 4. 

- CH SS+4, dash U+1+2~U~n, 1+2            [dmg 52]
In Tekken 4 it takes 52 points of damage, which is VERY worthwhile, especially
because other damaging combo after CH 4, f+3,3, takes 53 points. Just note that
it's much more difficult, you must time the cancel very precisely :) 
(in Tekken Tag it used to take 84 points of damage!!!)

- u/f+3+4, U+1+2~U,n,1+2 (*)              [dmg 37]
- u/f+3+4, U+1+2~U,n,1+2 (**)             [dmg 29~40]
(*)...is a great oki-zeme tool. (if only you scared somebody so much that 
he/she decides to wait on the floor:) It takes 37 points of damage! So far 
I found out that it's guaranteed after juggling "3" kick from the ground.
(**)...On standing opponent (u/f+3+4 knocks opponent down) it's also damaging.
Normally the damage would be 17 points. With Charge it raises even to 
40 points! It depends on how far you were from the opponent. The more damage, 
the merrier. ^_^ Hah hah hah!

- (1+2), 3+4, U+1+2,1+2, f,f+4            [dmg 65]
It's a combo after the Roo Kick from Flea :) It's without the cancel, but
the Charge makes it be really damaging alone. :) Simple and handy. :)
Works also after SIT -> (3), 3+4 (you have to backdash a little)
It's possible, but also very difficult after a standard Roo Kick. You have
to backdash... best used versus small characters such as Xiaoyu.

Now Pogo Charge and walls :) Yeah, it's a deadly combination! Myself I 
discovered a few nice combos: 
 1. [ in the corner ] far push to f+2, 3, u+1+2~U~u/f,f ,f,F - takes up 
to 115-120 points :) It's far push, Backhand, Roundhouse, Pogo Charge-Cancel
and Pogo Run. For opponents who tend to press "B", it's best to follow the
Pogo Cancel with 1+2 headbutt. It's guaranteed. :)
 2. Everytime you connect 3 Roundhouse into a wall [ your opponent gets a wall
    stun ], go for Pogo Charge-Cancel. It will inflict 60 points of damage 
    itself! Now you have two options:
   - opponent was so shocked that he didn't Quick Roll: go for Pogo Run [ f,F ]
     for next 39 points of damage! 
   - opponent Quick Rolled: go for duck and Headbutt [ d~1+2 ]. If opponent was
     just about to attack you, you score a CH! It results either in a juggle of 
     your choice, or [ if in the corner ] into another wall stun! So another 
     Pogo Charge-Cancel or just a Pogo Run? ^_^ Delicious!

The same story goes to d/f+2 or u/f+3 resulting into a wall stun: again: Pogo 
Charge-Cancel, then watch your opponent ... :)
Anyway, your opponent may be smart enough to do a double SS after walltech. 
In this case you may miss with the headbutt... so now you can go to Pogo 
Charge trick that requires some manual skills:

Pogo MADNESS!

Today's 30.08.2003 and I discovered something extremely damaging :). It 
requires perfect timing, though, but is in fact possible in a regular fight. 
I mastered the "N" command Pogo Charge cancel because, well, I just changed 
my mind and realized that it's easier than u/f~f cancel. Just like old trick 
b,b+1~1, b,b, this little "N" cancel causes another sword hit [ 20 points ]. 
With the Pogo Charge, which full damage is 30 points, it's a deadly weapon. 

I examined again d/f+2 [ wall stun ], U+1+2~U~N - it's a 50 point combo alone!
[ sometimes 63 :) ]
And then I discovered that Pogo Run, if timed correctly, is guaranteed after 
this trick! It's a hard-core Yoshi combo! So you have a choice: continue the 
Pogo Charge-Cancel with Pogo Run immediately, or wait for opponent's reaction
and delay Pogo Run [ if he doesn't Quick Roll ] or do duck + 1+2 Headbutt if
opponent Quick Rolled and you think he will attack :). I found out that 
duck + 3+4 Roo Kick also works fine :). But as your opponent switches to
double SideStep after wall tech, it is not wise to wait after Pogo... I
suggest you train the (mostly) guaranteed combo instead.

d/f+2 [ wall stun ], U+1+2~U~N~f,F - up to 90 points of damage!!!

The timing is difficult, though, but with a little bit of practice, you can
master it for sure! It can be quick-rolled only in the last stage. It usually 
takes 58-76 points. After all, you can always mash 3+4 during Pogo Run to 
enter Indian Sit and suprise your opponent with another attack. Hah hah... 
It's so fast that even if your opponent tries QR in the middle, he gets hit.
Well, Practice CPU didn't manage to count all damage points as I trained 
this combo :). The only thing is that your timing must be perfect! If not, 
Pogo Run will miss [ not to mention the difficulty of Pogo Charge-Cancel 
itself! ]... but again: you can always enter Indian Sit :). Practise!

I'll try to describe you the timing: as soon as you notice that d/f+2 caused
a wall stun, enter Pogo and hold "U" direction (Pogo Charge)... wait until 
the first sound of sword hit, then release "U" as fast as you can (Charge 
Cancel) and immediately f,F!

This combo is possible after the following starters [ wall stun of course ]:
EASY: d/f+2; u/f+3
MEDIUM: (f+)3; CH (2)~3 (both must hit close for full damage)
HARD: (3+4),3+4~f,F (waste time for turn around); f,f+4(must have perfect
alignment), CH SS+4(really close the wall, must have perfect alignment),
CH D/B+3,3,(...), F+4 (must have prefect alignment)

Also, the following combo:

f+1+3 (far push), f+2, 3, U+1+2~U~N, f,F

... is also possible next to the straight wall! You don't have to be in the 
corner, but the fact is that in the corner you don't have to care about your
opponent's alignment. While facing a flat wall, f+2 must move your opponent
slightly to Yoshi's right so that 3 smashes him directly into a wall. Then, 
Pogo Charge-Cancel and Pogo Run is a piece of cake! Just to remind you: this 
little combo takes huge 120 points of damage :). 
Other version of this combo is:
f+1+3, f+2, f+3, U+1+2~U~N, 1+2 
As I mentioned somewhere above, this one can't be escaped if done right... or
at least is very hard to escape :)

to try a duck, Roo Kick or Indian Sit, it may help :).
As a direct attack... well, you must time it perfectly! (it's SLOW!) But if 
Yoshi is already in the air, he can be only SideStepped. :)

The recovery time after this would be tragic... if not the possibility to 
enter Indian Sit afterwards. :)
 = ~3+4 (During 3rd hop)
It's great because it makes all what your opponent wants to throw at you whiff
Not to mention you're in Indian Sit Mode. :) Yeah. :)
During run Yoshi hit any move your opponent may do, but he/she can defend it
pressing "B" guard. It's not possible close to a wall, fortunately for Yoshi.
If there's no space where your opponent can back up, the run will hit! It's
a good tool for opponents standing up near a wall. :) No escape! Then you can
enter Indian Sit and SIT -> 1 Moonsault Slayer the lying opponent...

And now a good move, indeed! It dodges high moves and juggles on CH! It's one
of the best attacks after Yoshi's Flea. Now to list some sample combos:

CH (1+2),1+2, f+3,3                                   [dmg 47]
CH (1+2),1+2, f+1, b+1, d/f+1,1, d+1                  [dmg 37 + 10]

CH (1+2),1+2, f+1, b+1,1, d/f+3,1                     [dmg 46]...etc.
CH (1+2),1+2, f+1, b+1, f+4,4 (~10-string? :)         [dmg 39] <- interesting
CH (1+2),1+2, f+4,4... (~10-string? KD closer :)      [dmg 39] <- interesting

Good move, use it! ^_^ You'll have it ducked rarely. :) Also, it's starts 
dodging high attacks very early, you can enter Pogo and immediately do this:
Your opponent will notice the Pogo and rush with jabs just in time to be hit
with the Skull Splitter for CH and Juggle :) See also: Roo Kick below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In fact this move starts ducking immediately after command input! It takes 20
frames for Yoshi to enter Pogo, so this move starts dodging high moves, let's
say: after 21 frames. :) Quite fast. :) If you fight against a jab-happy 
turtler, you can enter Pogo and immediately follow it up with this: your 
opponent will be hit as he tries any jabs. :) It's tricky, because he will
think: "Oh, Yoshi in Pogo! Attack!" ... but just as he thinks so, Yoshi will
be already in the Roo Kick mode. Very similar situation to the Headbutt. :)
Just, as always, don't become predictable. :) If you have it blocked... ouch!

What can I say... a great evasive maneuver! It's nice that Yoshi can switch
the stances... also, it obviously will make all high hits whiff... but be
careful. The initial animation looks like Yoshi is floating a moment in the
air before he bumps on the ground... he's vulnerable. Experienced opponents
may jab you and juggle... but it never happened in my case. :)

New Yoshi's move... the Ducking Flea can be very useful! It ducks high moves 
and links fluently to other Yoshi's moves, giving them extra delay and even
ducking properties:
1+2, d~1+2
1+2, d~3+4
1+2, d~d+3+4...etc...
This input can save you from being hit if e.g. the jab series lasted longer
than you expected (like versus Nina...). And... this moves doesn't activate
the sword if you previously hit someone with Flea... what?! Nonsense! >_<
Mix up "d", "3" and "4" to do a crazy Yoshi Flea Dance, which causes a big
headache to anybody who tries to follow his moves :)

New Yoshi's move, probably to make Yoshi's Flea be more mobile... Yoshi does
a sidespin depending on input:
 - 4 input moves Yoshi to his right (logical, 4 is his right leg)
 - 3 input moves Yoshi to his left.
It's fast, but moves Yoshi a short distance... the dodging ability is quite
small, judging from my experience. Your best bet is to mix it up with "d"
duck for better results. Even continuous 3333 or 4444 won't help against a
couple of jabs, which track awesomely...
Mixing up 3,4 and d... it's good, really! The "d" Duck cannot be cancelled 
into another duck, but it can be cancelled into any other flea move. :) The
3 or 4 Flea SS are the quickest way to get another duck to work. 
Crazy Yoshi dance? :) Yeah! ^_^
Just one thing: the "always face the opponent" ability is kinda screwed up...
It should be like this... but in fact if your opponent sidesteps a lot, you
can sometimes find yourself backwards to the opponent after doing this move.
It sucks, really. Also, you're not spinning directly to the side, but always
slightly backwards, just like in b+3+4 dodging move. It should be fixed!
Also, it activates the sword after you hit someone with Flea and it became 
inactive. Keep it in mind. :)

A word to finish this table: you cancel Pogo by pressing "b", not "d" (like in
previous Tekkens). It can cause a mess if you're turned back to your opponent
while in the Flea: in this case press "f"... or anyway, go for a mve :P

= MEDITATION ARTS = [ shortcut: MED ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
= Moves starting from MEDITATION only. Command: (SS)+3+4 = 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short description of this Stance:
Yoshimitsu shows his back to his opponent, holding his sword in front of him,
meditating in a specific way: as if he was talking with his sword...
And now I'm really satisfied! The brand new Meditation is one of Yoshi's 
coolest tools to annoy your opponent, gain life and score more damage in one,
not to mention it's also very deceptive. :) It can be done by pressing 3+4 in
normal stance or from Side Step (and that's very good! It should be done with
Yoshi's 1+4 flash as well! >_<), and don't forget about the "after SS+4" 
switch! ^_^ This stance is very "flexible", so to speak, it can be cancelled
easily, making it easy to do a number of buffered extensions... Just be awared
that you actually back-face your opponent... watch him carefully not to eat
a powerful retaliation in your back... Enter this stance whenever:
 - Your opponent has little ways to move (e.g. after a juggle, after knocking
   him down...etc.)
 - Your opponent is backturned, slightly out of his BT kick range (e.g. after
   he whiffed his blow, you teleported behind, you turned him with f+2, BT 2)
 - You're at the distance (medium or farther, depending on character)
... after a little bit of practice, you'll find the opportunities by yourself,
spontaneously. ^_^ 
The flexibility of this stance is also visible in the ease of cancelling it.
You can cancel it by any direction:
 - u and d cancel causes Yoshi to do a sidestep, very slow one and with small
   evading capability... not recommended!
 - f cancel will turn Yoshi around in the spot.
 - b cancel will turn Yoshi and at the same time, Yoshi will go backwards,
   taking a really big step. It evades many moves!!!
The so-called "Yoshi's Ha-Ha Step" is exactly cancelling one Meditation into
another, using "b" cancel:
 - 3+4, b,3+4, b,3+4, b,3+4...
By doing this, Yoshi retreats very fast and, if timed correctly, makes many of
the opponent's moves whiff. :) It's also very annoying to your opponent. :)
Moreover, if you do the cancel immediately:
 - 3+4, b~3+4
...Yoshi will turn 180 degrees, facing his opponent, but still in Meditation!
These little maneuvers are not only cool-looking, but also useful... read on!

gained by such a slow move? A waste of time! If it was 20, then it would be
definitely worth doing, LOL. After the stun there's nothing you can do with
your opponent, as well... a show-off move, nothing more. I saw it once done by

And now a very good move!!! Yoshi lost the ability to do a command backflip
b~u/b, but he gained one from Meditation stance. (Anyway, I wish that backflip
returned to him, too... ^_^). Its reach and ability to juggle even on the tip
of Yoshi's claws/shoes will amaze you not once, not twice. :) In fact its
only disadvantages are slow wind-up time (which you can reduce by set-ups :)
and ease to Side Step by your opponent (but he must know it :). And here come
the rest of ADVANTAGES: truly small disadvantage if blocked (don't be fooled
with -7 frame parameter: in fact it has NO disadvantage if you buffer a follow
up after backflip!), BT mixups, it hits grounded opponents, travels far (hah,
sometimes if your opponent sidesteps it, you can really mess around!), and 
once again: it juggles!!! (also: near a wall it causes wall stun on hit...)
Here are some sample juggles:

(3+4),3+4, ~f (turn around), f+3,3              [dmg 43, lazybone combo :)]
(3+4),3+4, ~f, f+1, b+1,1,(1),1, f+3            [dmg 42]
(3+4),3+4, ~f, f+1, b+1,1, d/f+3,1              [dmg 42]
(3+4),3+4, ~U/F+4, 1, f,f+2                     [dmg 44]

... but what about follow-ups? You have a number of useful moves!
- (3+4),3+4~(BT)d+1 - it CAN'T be interrupted! But, of course, it can be 
  blocked or, even worse, parried. Anyway, opponents not familiar with Yoshi
  often fall prey to this! Not to mention you closed the gap between you and
  your opponent and have just began a custom string! (note: the punch is LOW!)
- (3+4),3+4,(BT)4 - it's for distance purposes: if you see the backflip won't
  reach your opponent and he has just began his retaliation maneuver, the BT 
  kick is very fast and has awesome priority, it will save you and inflict 
  some serious damage. But if you feel that it will be too slow...
- (3+4),3+4~d+3+4 - ...Indian Sit will evade 95% of moves your opponent may 
  want to throw at you. You sit backwards, of course: teleport immediately or
  do "2" Manji Spinning Backhands Backwards :P Show-off, neh?
- (3+4),3+4~u/f+4 - it's a juggling hopkick for all those who expect a low 
  punch. It's your "hit or die" mix-up, because the hopkick is quite risky.
  The windup is not so fast, recovery is quite poor (-10), and you must be
  upclose to be sure it will hit and juggle. But if it hits, it will juggle
  for massive damage, even crouching opponents! Worth trying! But first 
  abuse that low punch, heh heh :)
- (3+4),3+4~D/B+2,2,2 - try it!
- (3+4),3+4~U/F - a jump from BT position. :) I like it, especially if I 
  perform a backflip over lying opponent. Yoshi jumps on the other side,
  in this way... :) Well, it's very spontaneous... you have to see what
  your opponent is doing and act just to match his behaviour... :)
- (3+4),3+4~U/F+4 - it's a jumping hopkick in which Yoshi turns in the air
  to face his opponent. I use it at the farther medium distance as I think a 
  backflip will miss.

etc, etc...

Well, just a Harakiri, but from Meditation position... I like Yoshi's show-off
moves but only if the risk is worth taking it. And here... it's definitely too
much risky, and if you miss, your opponent will laugh at you and juggle you 
for more damage. I mean: hey: this move has SMALL reach, definitely too small
to use it effectively. A lot of Tekken moves has awesome reach, and you'll be
DEFINITELY treated with such moves by your opponent - it's the easiest way to
punish a backturned character without taking useless risk. Don't forget that 
it is a "harakiri", it damages Yoshimitsu... well, I have never used this move
in a serious battle, it's NOT recommended...
I even wonder why Yoshi received this move... o_O Well, maybe he was bored? :)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                === UNCONVENTIONAL  BUFFERED  EXTENSIONS ===

And here we go with Meditation's sweetest thingies - a pure fun - MED buffers!
       [P.S. "f" command means "towards your opponent", just in case...]
[P.S.2 Don't forget that "_" mark means "or", e.g. "b_f+1" means "b+1 or f+1"]

MED -> Manji Backhand 2 
       Notation - [ (3+4), f+2 or b+2 ]               [ range: h, damage: 12 ]
       (for frame data: see the special arts above)
I have mentioned the uses of this backhand already in its table: it has great
reach and guarantees after it, adding that the recovery time if blocked is not
bad after all. :) A nice move, use it! ^_^ But ...just don't whiff it, OK? :P

MED -> Turning high punch
       Notation - [ (3+4), b_f+1 or b_f+1 ]           [ range: h, damage: 12 ]
Well, just a turning jab... not that useful, but in fact faster than bufered
MED BT Kick... sometimes it will be more handy.

MED -> Turning high kick
       Notation - [ (3+4), b_f+3 or b_f+4 ]           [ range: h, damage: 25 ]
Hah, the best move with highest "priority/reach" average. :) It will stop 
opponents rushing-in many, many times. :) My favourite "keep-away". :) It's
funny and taunting to gain life in front of your opponent, and kick him away
as he tries to disturb you... ^_^ LOL

MED -> Turning low jab
       Notation - [ (3+4), b~d/b+1_2 or f~d/f+1_2 ]   [ range: l, damage: 10 ]
Yeah, it's one of Yoshi's best follow-ups! The low punch can stop everything!
It has only one disadvantage: you have to have a very good controller to do
this move constantly and be sure it won't fail in the worst moment...
My little piece of advice: myself I found out the "f" buffers to be more
reliable, it's because Yoshi turns around slower with "f" input than with "b"
input, and so (I think) you have more time to input a command (let's say: 
2 frames more :P ) Seriously: "f" buffers are the best! ^_^

MED -> Turning low kick
       Notation - [ (3+4), b~d/b+3_4 or f~d/f+3_4 ]   [ range: L, damage: 5 ]
Well, slower than low punch... not recommended unless you're bored with the
punch... :) Just a possibility. 

MED -> Backturned recovery
       Notation - [ (3+4), f~u/f~n ]                  [ range: -, damage: - ]
A very nice tool to begin Yoshi's "fox step" miscellaneous techniques. Yoshi
just recovers in BT stance! The notation must be very fast, and again: if you
have spoiled controller, you won't manage to do this. It's a very fast motion 
from f to u/f, ending directly on u/f! (if you hit "u" by mistake, Yoshi will
do that useless Sidestep from BT... slow one and very pathetic :)
From this you can do D/B+2,2,.. Spins backwards, a jump forward with hopkick, 
or just Sit... anything! A show-off move, and be sure you're safe: there's
always a possibility that you can miss the timing...

MED -> Buffered BT hopkick
       Notation - [ (3+4), f~u/f+4 ]                  [ range: m, damage: 25 ]
Yeah, a hopkick from Meditation is in fact possible! It looks just like a
standard BT hopkick, and juggles as well. :) Just note you have to time it 
right, as always. See BT Hopkick Table somewhere above for more details.

MED -> Buffered BT jumping hopkick
       Notation - [ (3+4), f~U/F+4 ]                  [ range: m, damage: 25 ]
And now my favourite buffer at the distance! I love it especially after two
"Steps" 3+4, b,3+4, it's enough to encourage the opponent to attack. It closes
the gap between Yoshi and his enemy, takes some serious damage, and even can
cause a weird KD with a little juggle guaranteed :) See Jumping Hopkick Table
above. :) Not to mention it's suprising and cool-looking!

MED -> Buffered BT jumping stun kick
       Notation - [ (3+4), f~U/F,N,3 ]                [ range: m, damage: 25 ]
The kick worth mentioning because of its stunning capabilities, but in fact
it's slow and many people seeing Yoshi in the air will block on reaction. The
above jumping hopkick is more suprising due to it's speed. You can try... :)
but at your own risk :P

MED -> Buffered BT jumping low kick
       Notation - [ (3+4), f~U/F,N,3 ]                [ range: L, damage: 12 ]
You have to wait longer during "N" neutral command, just perform it "on the
way down". Or input "N,d+3", it also works :). This kick is for all those who
will block on reaction seeing Yoshi in the air, he heh. :) It also hits 
grounded opponents, just to remind you. On hit you can follow it up with Sword
Sweep, it's rarely escaped. But anyway, people that know the timing of all 
jumping stuff MAY predict what's coming and block it... it's not very hard,
but in fact only expert players will anticipate it. :)

All jumping stuff may be performed by f~U/F+"blah-blah" command :)

                     ============ HARD STUFF! ============

MED -> Buffered BT Sit backwards            MED -> Buffered BT Flea backwards
       Notation - [ (3+4), f~d/f~d+3+4 ]    Notation - [ (3+4), f~1+2 ]    

...it can be done, but it's very difficult. Wish it was coded in the next
Tekken! Let's say: simple d+3+4 and u+1+2 from Meditation... Namco!!!! ^_^
Soul Calibur can't be better, but Tekken in fact CAN! More effort to Tekken!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ===== Meditation turn around to Meditation extensions! 3+4, b~3+4 =====
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Small note: do these trick ONLY if you have a window to do this! Play safely, 
risk only if it's worth taking it! The extensions below are mainly for fun!

 - 3+4, b~3+4, f~u/f+3      => Meditation Forward to Samurai Knee
It's the fastest extension and your main keep-away if you notice that your 
opponent rushes at you. BOOM! ... and juggle :) Good move, and easy one.

 - 3+4, b~3+4, D/B ~+1      => Meditation Forward to Approach-Low punch
Fun, pure fun! If your opponent doesn't know what's going on, you can
approach him in a funny way and start a custom string from a turning low
punch! Adding that if you hit D/B, Yoshi will crouch under all high
attacks. Nice maneuver, but if you think you won't manage to do this (small
window), always be ready to launch Samurai Knee. This example is not a 
buffer, but a funny way to use Meditation Forward properties.
And remember:
To approach opponent from Meditation forward you press "b"
To turn around in the spot you press "f"

 - 3+4, b~3+4, f~D/B+2,2.. => Meditation Forward to Spin Backwards
Show off! Nice way to begin fox step techniques. Try it!

 - 3+4, b~3+4, f~4~3        => Meditation Forward to Roo Kick Backwards
You can also do a "b" version, doing a sway to your opponent, and 
immediately a Roo Kick backwards... funny move, mainly to avoid high
attacks and laugh at your opponent, also after evading you have always
Yoshi's BT options: low punch, BT Kick...

 - 3+4, b~3+4, f~u/f+4      => Meditation Forward to Avoiding the Puddle
This Keep-away is slower than Samurai Knee and doesn't evade high attacks...
but it evades the low ones! Use it with caution, though.

 - 3+4, b~3+4, f~u/f+1+2    => Meditation Forward to Deathcopter
 - 3+4, b~3+4, f~u/f+1+2~D  ===> Meditation Forward to Deathcopter Slash
 - 3+4, b~3+4, f~u/f+1+2~B  ===> Meditation Forward to Deathcopter Trick
What can I say, show-off! The most useful is Deathcopter Trick: not only you
suprised your opponent with a Deathcopter, but you flied behind him! ^_^

 - 3+4, b~3+4, f~U/F+4      => Meditation Forward to Jumping Hopkick
Good move! Yeah, I like all these Yoshi's jumpkicks... but if only they had
even better recovery time... let's say: [ -5 Badv! ]. PLEASE?! ^_^

 - 3+4, b~3+4, f~U/F, N+3   => Meditation Forward to Stun Kick
 - 3+4, b~3+4, f~U/F,N,d+3  => Meditation Forward to Low Kick
                            => ... and all jumping stuff...
Fun, fun, fun! Show your opponent that you're not afraid of him/her! Yeah, 
Yoshi is a sort of a character that fears NOT losing energy. :) 
Of course it's not all what Yoshi can do from this stance... experiment!

==============================================================================
= [7] :: Advanced Strategy & Tricks ::
==============================================================================

  == Intro: =Do not part Manji Arts to "stances, special arts, etc." ==

We love to name things and treat them as separated items, but everything is
important and works well only if put together. That's why the "Advanced 
Strategy & Tricks" section is mainly a summary, enriched with more examples,
uses and in-depth destination of each of Yoshimitsu's techniques. Also, you'll
have to incorporate the walls and the knowldege about each of Tekken character
to be as much efficient as you can. Sounds difficult? Naaah... ^_^

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Arenas breakout ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JUNGLE 
Well, it's Yoshi's arena, so it must be listed in the first place. :) It has
the awesome slope, so fight badly to have your opponent above. Yoshi, being
slightly on the lower level, can score awesome juggles using the slope:
d/f+2, b+1,(1),(1),1, d/f+1,1,1,1 - as a nice example!
Also, the walls are really rough and sometimes your opponent won't have any
chance to walltech a wall combo... yeah, you don't have to hurry with the
Pogo Charge-Cancel-Pogo Run Combo. Water looks nice, but try to travel with
your opponent up the slope... and beware above: some nasty juggles can be
done near the upper-lewel walls due to their curved structure...

HON-MARU
Well, a very simple and rectangular arena, the most desired position is of
course "opponent in the corner" one... but even being near the wall you can
score awesome wall juggles, especially being in the middle distance of each
wall, slightly facing the corner (at an angle to the wall).
Being in the middle of the shorter wall you can do any blow that results 
into wall stun (e.g. SideStep to Yoshi's left and 3 roundhouse), and begin
a crazy juggle (made by Tenshi :P)
wall stun 3, f+1, b+1, f+1, b+1, f+3,4!
After sidestep Yoshi must be at an angle slightly less than 90 degrees to
the wall, with his left hand closer to the wall than right, facing right.
This will juggle the opponent to the corner, and a whole Zig-Zag will hit
since the 3 roundhouse will result into a side-type stun in the next wall...
Delicious juggle, and not so hard to do... but you have to catch the 
occasion. :) Also, being near the corner with your back to the wall, you
can take the risk and try to score SS+4~3+4 on CH. Then the spinning
juggle after Meditation Hopkick will not only send your opponent on the 
wall, but many times you'll be able to juggle even longer, scoring even up
to 100 points of damage! 
In general: all your spinning juggles may travel with your opponent up the
wall, depending on distance. :) If you're sure your opponent will try a
wall tech, you can try my b,b+1 set-up. Just do as much spins as you think
that after them and a d/f+3 finisher, your opponent will hit the wall
and tech, at the distance slightly more than one lying opponent far from
you. Start b,b+1 just after d/f+3. Your opponent will lose his time doing
the wall tech, and won't manage to hit you before the unblockable 
connects! ^_^ This can be done near any wall, not only in Hon Maru.
Also, 4~3 and spins are awesome here... :) You can travel really far!

ARENA
A very dangerous stage, many of your opponents have here simple and
infinite (!) juggles called "around arena". You also can travel with your
opponent at least through 4 or 5 walls, but for Yoshi it's in fact very
difficult... You have to juggle your opponent slightly at an angle to
the wall to catch a side-type wall stun... then you'll have to time the spins
and jabs right to have more side-type stuns on each of the wall. I saw on
Inca's vid the sequence:
(wall stun, side-type) f+1, b+1, f+1, f,f+4 (run up for the next stun)
...but it can be done only if you align your opponent right... hard stuff.
Well... you better stay away from the walls if facing around-arena easy
characters...  

UNDERGROUND
The true Hard-Core arena! Everybody is great here, and Yoshi is no exception,
heh heh! If you land a SS+2 near the wall or even f+2 or 4~3 wherever you 
are, your opponent can kiss even up to 100 points goodbye!
SS+2 is a tricky combo. Heh heh, as your opponent gets juggled in this way:
SS+2, f+1
... if he's near the wall, feet forward the obstacle, he won't fly away
from Yoshi... and so you can unleash the truly damaging spinning combos, 
which take usually about 60 points, but if you're good at predicting the 
spinning pattern, you can do a real, painful around arena juggle with this!
My personal record is 119 points of damage. :)
Even starting with simple d/f+2 at an angle (you must be lucky to align
your opponent right in the heat of the battle, but anyway, it's possible!)
you can start the around arena. See Inca's vid. He then repeated the pattern:
(wall stun, side-type) b+1,1, b+1,1, b+1,1, b+1,1... etc.
As for 4~3, you'll have to watch the spacing. Go to the other side after
launch and spin to the wall with your opponent. Many times you'll have the
opportunity to juggle him longer due to rough walls. :)
Great arena! I didn't mention Pogo Rush combos after any push or wall stun!
And don't forget the miraclous CH SS+4~3+4, 3+4 spinning juggles. :)

SHINJUKU
Well, I don't fight here too often... it has phone boxes which you can
spoil... it's quite narrow, and one wall is worth paying close attention.
It's curved, which means you can score there the side-type stun more
easily and juggle your opponent further. You'll have to act spontaneously
depending on the distance and the point of the wall where you scored the
side-type stun... so I can't give you examples.

AIRPORT
Very wide arena... has some walls, but they're not worth mentioning. Also,
watch the place where the airplane stands... the 4~3 Roo Kick juggles won't
fit there since your opponent will hit the plane flying up. :)
Old-school days, Yoshi must count mainly on his flat ground juggles.

PARKING AREA
Well, quite a narrow arena, with many bugs and glitches to exploit. :)
You can see two columns and a car between them: here you can juggle your
opponent for a long time if he lands backturned to the wall, especially if
he fits into the car-column corner. Painful!
Also, the last round column is extremely cheap. :) You can create there an 
infinite juggle since your opponent can't tech roll from the round surface!
As a nice example, this easy juggle:
CH SS+4, f+1, d/b+1, WS+1, f+1, 4,4, d/b+1, WS+1, f+1, 4,4....etc, etc...
You can create your own! ^_^

MALL
Well, another nice slope (stairs) which you can exploit. :) Just run away
from your opponent if you start on the higher level, go down the stairs...
and now you can hunt for your favourite juggle starter. If you start below,
just gradually run away to the stairs... the fastest "means of transport"
(heh heh!) is of course Meditation Step 3+4, b,3+4, b,3+4...
Nice columns to hide from your opponent... you can trick him into run
and start the b,b+1 unblockable. Many, many times your opponent will be
stopped in the spot by the column! If you're lucky, he won't finally go
through but will score the unblockable. :) The same goes to every
obstacle as you're on the other side (like Phone boxes in Shinjuku...)

BUILDING
Oww, a nice slope again! But this one is more flat, not to mention a 
rough surface... be careful with your combos here. Many statues to
spoil, many corners... nice arena. 

STATUE
A true challenge: it's narrow, has lots of columns, and LOTS of corners
which you can exploit! Sometimes you'll juggle somebody from column
to column and end in one of the corners... for infinite juggle! It's
but very difficult and requires extremely spontaneous acting.
Not to mention a slope, hah hah. :) But this one is quite flat...

BEACH
It's quite wide and has many interesting walls... you can't (fortunately!)
be juggled near the tree, you'll just pass through the pixel chaos of a poor
plant. :) Nothing interesting to mention... just act as you usually
do near the wall or in the open area...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Approach, Retreat... that is: positioning again! ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why am I constantly coming back to this topic, huh? Just to make you remember
that positioning is very, veeeerrrryyyy important. I'll make here a short
summary for you, listing all Yoshimitsu's approach/retreat tools:

 == Approach tools: ==

dash forward. :P - it's the simpliest and most effective tool! Chain it with
SS and it will work like a charm. :)
B+1,(1),(~3+4) - safe approach
D/B+2,(2,2..) - medium/close distance, sets up guess-up game
f+2~D/B+2 - from medium distance, sets up guess-up game or semi-guarantee
D/B+3,3~(f+4_or_d+3+4) - medium/far dist., works best after SS, hard to see
                     best used: spinning kicks whiff and only last f+4 hits
d/f+1,1 - (works best on hit, follow up with custom string, sets up guess-up)
d/f+1,2~D/B+2 - (can be good... but I'm not quite after it)
(buffer)~D/B+3 - Sweeping kick, you land close, use with caution
u/f+3+4~d+3+4 - as a nice example
f,f+1+2 - closes a HUGE gap

## psychological approach (let your opponent come to you, encourage him!)

SS+1, d/b+1 (on any rush-in)
d+1 (irritates and encourages to attack)
D/B+1+2~any (opponent will 80% attack from the distance or rush in)
Whiffed WS+1 (encourages)
Whiffed WS+4 (encourages)
QCF+2 at the distance (cautious!)
Flash 1+4 at the distance :)
3+4 Meditation variations
Indian Sit at the distance
Flea at the distance
Whiffed d+4 (follow up with WS+4 on rush in)
u/f+3+4~d+3+4 at the distance. 90% of moves will whiff!
being near the wall :P (wall jump anybody? ^_^)
etc, etc...

 == Retreat Tools ==

Simple SS
Simple backdash
SS+1 (great reach)
d/f+4 (great reach)
a couple of "1" jabs in a row
b+3+4
d/b+1, WS+4, (d/f+4) (you land in medium distance)
Flash 1+4 (you have disadvantage!)
1+2+3 (rarely used, slow comparing to 1+4)
d+3+4 Indian Sit, and mainly teleportation.
3+4 Meditation variation, start at the distance
etc, etc...

It's a summary, which will be repeated over and over. :) Even in the next 
setion you'll find the "go-away" custom strings... heh heh :)
Positioning is also extremely important in connection with walls. They can be
your worst nightmare, but also the best friend: in fact Yoshi becomes really
powerful only if he has a wall somewhere nearby. ^_^

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Custom Strings: Yoshi's first MUSTLEARN! ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Custom Strings" - "A custom string is a series of quick moves in which, when 
used together, make it very difficult for your opponent to do much of anything
besides blocking." - It's a "Custom String" definition from the ever great 
Tragic's "Yoshimitsu Manual" FAQ... Here I'll explain the idea of Custom 
Stringing and the very basics of this Art as well as the in-depth analyzis.

A good Custom String must have three features:
 - FLOW, VARIATION and DESTINATION.

 == Flow in custom strings ===

Unfortunately, Yoshi has been much toned down and the disadvantages he has
don't allow him to constantly keep a pressure on experienced opponents. 
(I mean: constantly keep a pressure without any stress that you can be 
interrupted... in fact experienced players will hit you out of strings many
times before you'll learn that not only moves and its properties counts...)
Every player knows the power and priority of jabs, and if he fits a single 
d/b+1 into your string, he'll gain the advantage and begin his stringing 
nastiness. Hard thing... that's why you count on tricking your opponent
into certain behaviour to gain a hit: after hit you have the required 
advantage to continue a string with little chance to get interrupted. 
Some of your strings has the flow and speed, but they can be evaded... you 
have to catch the moment in which your opponent may want to retaliate to either
come off with your next set of moves or use one of the destination finishers.

Also, note that your basic jab has little approach attitude. Comparing to
Paul's jabs, Yoshi pretty much stays in the spot... that's why Yoshi must
be more cautious, his jabs can be easily backdashed! Only two or three
Yoshi's jabs in a row still connects on opponent's block.

Moreover, in Tekken 4 Yoshi's custom strings must be very fast, reaching their
destination just after a couple of moves. Only if you actually hit somebody
with a move that closes the gap, you can continue "keep-a-pressure". 
Otherwise, if your opponent blocks the move that closes the gap (but has
a disadvantage), if you use a fast follow-up: you are likely to be outpoked.
If you think you are likely to be, use your guess-up techniques or just
block and use opponent's small but visible disadvantage. :) 
(e.g. you blocked d/b+1 : do d/b+1 by yourself! Opponent won't manage to
do any WS follow-up :) BUT beware a parry! )

Also, you can implement the nose-to-nose movement, SS and backdashes to
make your custom strings even more efficient. More about this: later on.

These features build the most safe way of custom stringing. 

Here are the moves which can be done with little chance to be interrupted:

a move:          speed:          recovery:         your opponent lands:
1+4           ultra fast!          poor             in medium distance
1              very fast         excellent          close/medium 
f+1            very fast         excellent          close 
d/b+1          very fast           great            close/medium 
WS+4             fast            very good          medium 
WS+1             fast              great            close
2              very fast         excellent          close

(close/medium: depends on the point where you used a move and what moves
were used before you followed them up with this hit.)

Mixing these moves will bring great results, but it's not all. High jabs
can be ducked, d/b+1 can be parried, WS+4 can be interrupted if somebody
is also in FC position and starts his/her own WS move... but in fact these
moves are one of the fastes moves Yoshi possesses!

Moreover, keep in mind that:
1. 1~(1)~d/b+1 can't be interrupted. (only blocked or parried)
2. d/b+1~WS+any can be interrupted by jabs if d/b+1 is blocked. If d/b+1 
   hits, any While Standing move cannot be interrupted.
3. it's best to continue a string if WS move hits.
Remember this while examining the custom string I'll give you. ^_^

And here's the next set of moves. These moves are mainly moves which push
your opponent away or again close the gap between you and your opponent,
some of them also set up a little guess up in the higher level of play.
Continue a string if they hit. Otherwise: block or try a guess-up...

a move:          speed:    recovery:   properties: 
throw            fast      excellent   catches everything if timed properly
d/f+1            fast        poor      SS-catch
d/f+1,1          fast        good      natural combo, approach, guess-up
d/f+1,1,1,1      fast      excellent   guard break, closes the gap
D/B+2          semi-fast     good      SS-catch, FC, approach, guess-up
D/B+2,2...     semi-fast     poor      SS-catch, FC, approach, little guess-up
b+1              fast      excellent   ~3+4, travels far, recovers close
b+1,1...         fast      excellent   ~3+4, travels far, recovers close
b+1~D/B+3,3      fast        poor      natural combo, SIT or f+4 finisher
d/f+2          average       great     JG on hit, good reach, approach, ducks
                                       high moves, sometimes can continue
f,f+1+2        average   average/poor  closes huge gap, BT, ~b+3+4, ~d+3+4, 
                                       go-behind on opponent's SS, guess-up...

And here you are with custom strings finishers. They either push your opponent
away or are a set-up for more damage (or next custom string):

a move:          speed:   recovery:    properties: 
D/B+1+2,any     average     great      evades high moves, starts juggle
u/f+3            fast       poor       evades high moves, starts juggle
FC,b_D/F+1    semi-slow     poor       evasive, starts juggle, UNblockable
d+1           semi-slow  average/good  linear attack, encourages to attack,
                                       gain advantage before this, best
                                       used in medium distance
d/f+4            fast       average    pushes away, SS-catch, advantage on hit
U/F+4         semi-slow  average/poor  linear move, continue string on hit
d+1           semi-slow     average    linear move, best used in medium dist, 
                                       encourages to attack on hit.
SS+1           average   average/poor  highly evasive, JGc, pushes away
SS+2           average   average/poor  highly evasive, JG, you can't continue
SS+4           average   average/poor  CFSc, evades linear attacks, SS-catch
d/b+4          average      average    evades lots of attacks, Yoshi lands
                                       far away, safe.
d/f+2          average       great     look above. ^_^
f,f+1+2        average   average/poor  look above. ^_^
any stance     depends   depends       depends

Just to answer any possible questions: the moves above are the most often
used in custom strings, in fact you can use every single move Yoshi possesses!
It's all about creating your own style of play, taking into consideration
your knowledge about each move's recovery. For example:
d+3 to WS+3
It's not a wise string since d+3 leaves you at disadvantage, and WS+3 takes
time to be executed.
You can use every move, but not every move after every move in every 
situation. :P That's why we're talking all the time about set-ups, 
follow-ups, etc... I think you got my point. :)

 == Variation in custom strings == 

Best variation property is "guess-up", and best guess-up is a choice between:
1> LOW or MID move (jugglestarter mostly)
2> FAST move and UNBLOCKABLE move
3> MID jugglestarter and HIGH move/random throw (tricking into duck)
4> (higher level) tricking into LOW parry and MID jugglestarter/UNBLOCKABLE

Examples to the 1> point:
 - d/b+1, WS+4 <-or-> d/b+1, FC,d+4_or_FC,d/f+3
 - 1,1, d+4 <-or-> 1,1, d/f+4
 - 1,1~D/B+3 <-or-> 1,1, u/f+3

Examples to the 2> point:
 - 1, d/b+1, WS+4 <-or-> 1, d/b+1, FC,b+1 (sword sweep)
 - 1, d/b+1, FC,d/f+3 <-or-> 1, d/b+1, FC,b+1 (this is also good because
people will wait for the Lunging Sweep hoping to block it and juggle poor
Yoshi, and: SUPRISE! Sword Sweep will hit them for juggle :) )

Examples to the 3> point:
 - 1,1,1, u/f+3 <-or-> 1,1,1 QCF+1+2
 - 1, QCF+1+2 <-or-> 1, d/f+1,1 ( + string continuation,e.g. ~d/b+1, FC,b+1...)
 - d/b+1, u/f+3 <-or-> d/b+1, 2+4
 - dash, throw <-or-> dash, u/f+3 ( try to see how your opponent acts on this
sudden approach... ducking is very often used. :) Or: use throws a lot, and
then switch to throw-u/f+3 guess-up. :)
etc... etc...

Examples to the 4> point:
 - 1, d/b+1, WS+4 <-or-> 1,~D/F+1 (opponent wants to parry d/b+1, BUT! :)
 - d/b+1, d+4 all the time :) <-or-> d/b+1, u/f+3

It's all about knowing all possible extensions or combinations out of
normal stance and FC/WS. I think you already got my point. :)
(just keep in mind that u/f+3 is a risky finisher in a higher level of play.
But anyway, it's a great extension, best used after SS and against SS :P)


 == Custom string and its destination (sample custom strings) ==

- Constant keep-a-pressure, approaching opponent

# 1,1, d/b+1, WS+4, d/f+2 (be careful here), d/b+1, WS+4...
  [ here you'll have to figure out if your opponent is smart enough to start
  a series of jabs. If yes, then you can be hit out of d/b+1]
# 1,1, d/f+1,1 (continuation on hit!), d/b+1, WS+4, d/f+2...
# [optional: b+1,1~3+4 (approach)], b+1, d/b+1, WS+1, 1,1, b+1~3+4, 1...
# D/B+2 (continuation on hit!)~d/b+1, WS+1, 1,1...
# 1, SS~f+1, SS~d/f+2, d/b+1, d+4~D, WS+4, d/f+2... (*)
# 1, d/b+1, WS+1, 1, f+1
# 1,(1), SSR~D/B+2, (and D/B+2 mix-ups)

(*) In this string hold on D after d+4 just a little to gain FC position,
you'll then be able to 99% duck high jabs and score WS+4 on CH. Dunno
why, if done straight d+4~WS+4, high jabs will hit you... use it also
in other WS strings. :)

- Go-away custom strings

# 1,1, d/f+4
# 1, d/b+1, WS+4, d/f+4
# 1, d/b+1, WS+4, SS+1
# 1, d/f+2, b,b~SS+1
# 1,1, b+3+4, SS+1
# d/b+1, WS+4, b+3+4...

- unblockable set-ups

# 1,1~D/F+1 (Sword Sweep, you count on "I wanna block low move" reaction :)
# D/B+2~FC,b+1 (Sword Sweep again)
# b+1, d/b+1, FC,b+1 (Yeah... I love this move! ^_^)
# 1,1,1, D/B+1+2~any (you count on "jab-for-jab" reaction, irritating! :)
# 1,1, SS~f+1,1, D/B+1+2~any (as above :)
# d/b+1, FC,d/f+3, then do d/b+1, FC,b+1... it WORKS! (try to block it, hehe!)
# 1,1, d/f+4 (on hit), d+1
# d/b+1, WS+4, D/B+1+2~any (my favourite, connects suprisingly often :)
# 1, d/b+1, FC,b+1

- jugglestarter or combo set-ups

# d/b+1, WS+2 (counting on retaliation try inbetween)
# d/b+1, WS+4, SS+2
# 1,1,1, d/f+2 (any jabs or quick parry, please? Will duck or evade! :)
# D/B+2~SS+1 (on hit is the most safe)
# b+1,n, 1, b+1~3+4, d/f+2
# 2, 1, (2), 2,3 (you wanna hit me, huh? But you score a foot in YA FACE! ^_^)
# d/b+1~SS+2 (*)
# d/b+1~SS+1 (*)
# d/b+1~SS~u/f+3 (*)

 (*) A series of these fast customs is incredible. It must have only one
condition: d/b+1 must hit or be blocked slightly at the distance. Then it
works like a charm versus jab abusers, no matter low or high jab!!! SS
will awesomely evade jabs, not to mention evasive SS moves or u/f+3...
Use SS+1 under a longer series or jabs to juggle on CH ^_^ 

- throw set-ups

# dash, throw :P (mix with dash, u/f+3)
# 1, d/b+1, throw
# 1, QCB+1+2
# 1, SS+1 (normal hit), QCF+2
etc, etc...

 - reading your opponent

# All guess-up custom strings mentioned somewhere above


 == Final words ==

Custom stringing is not only the matter of moves, follow-ups etc. There are
also other major factors of efficient custom stringing:
1. Movement, positioning (again :P)
2. Timing (as somebody once said: "TIMING IS EVERYTHING!" Close to the truth.)
3. Deception (will be also described later)

MOVEMENT
A couple of jabs can be only a couple of jabs, but in connection with ever
present positioning and movement it can be even more efficient. 
Theres a huge difference between:
1,1, d/b+1, WS+4, d/f+2
and:
1, SS~f+1, d/b+1, WS+4...
1,1, SS~d/b+1, WS+4...
1,1, d/b+1, SS~d/f+2...etc, etc...

... As a nice example. Not only because sidestep or backdash can evade some 
moves thrown at you, but it also makes any possible parry/reversal whiff,
and it sets up an element of unpredictibility into your gameplay. Not to 
mention powerful u/f+3 if you have just evaded a move... :)
I don't claim that you have to move all the time, it will only cause a mess,
not to mention that frustrated opponents can feast you with a series of fast,
tracking jabs... it's quite painful, you know :P.
Well, you have to experiment and experience it by yourself, it's the only
way. You'll then feel when to do what. ^_^

TIMING
It's very easy to understand and at the same time: very difficult to do.
To unleash a blow just in time, not to early, not to late: it's the best what
you can do in Tekken. ^_^ It also requires other feature, that is: simple
calculation. Sometimes it's better not to end a string with desired finisher
but just back up (for example: you want to do a WS+4 after blocked d/b+1,
but you see that your opponent does a backdash: doing WS+4 would be unwise
because yor opponent will surely hit you during WS+4 whiff recovery time.)
Moreover, sometimes it's better to stay in the spot than SS... (due to SS
tracking moves some of your opponents possess...). Sometimes is better to just
press a block just after a move than do a backdash. (due to some moves' reach)
Timing is extremely important, and you'll gain the ability to time your moves
right together with the game experience. Just patience! ^_^
And do not confuse the timing with reading your opponent. These terms are
connected with each other, but it's not the same. 

DECEPTION
It can be all-present in your gameplay, like simple acts as sudden SideStep or 
unexpected u/f+3 just after you came closer and ducked. The "haha, I did this,
not that" words should never abandon you and be your aim in custom stringing.
Experiment! ^_^

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Juggles & Combos: Yoshi's second MUSTLEARN ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, you already know a lot of juggles, I think you wonder why I made a 
section for it now. :) It's a summary after all... heh heh. :) Also, I would
like to show you how a juggle can change its destination in connection with 
the Arts listed above: that is:
in connection with positioning and custom strings. 
You have already learned how to set-up a jugglestarter using a custom string,
also keep in mind that a lot of jugglestarters Yoshi possesses doesn't 
neccessarily have to have a set-up. Just to list d/f+2, SS+2 and CH SS+1. 
You can throw them here and there, without any fear of being punished (OK, 
maybe SS+2 has somewhat poor recovery time :P)
In next section (Oki-zeme) you'll read that opponent's troubles don't end
after you finish a juggle: he may be tricked into one of Yoshi's many
set-ups for more damage!

1. The art of Juggles and Combos
To start with the basic but underestimated facts... I'll list for you all
jugglestarters Yoshi possesses, and also present you main rules in building
your own juggles, not only the ones you can do every time, but also the
ones you'll do spontaneously, seeing where flies your opponent and how
much time you have to input next command.

Here are the most often used jugglestarters Yoshi possesses:
d/f+2
SS+2
u/f+3
FC,d/f+3
d/b+1+2,any(FAR)
4~3 (and all Roo Kicks from stances)
(3),3
(3+4),3+4
(u/f+3+4, b+1), 4
BT u/f+4
CH SS+1
CH WS+2,
CH (1+2),1+2,
CH U/F+4
Lying on ground (b+3+4), 1
Lying on ground 3 (CLOSE)

And here are the combo starters (stunners or low-jugglers)
CH SS+4
CH (2),3
d/b+1+2,any(CLOSE)
FC,b_D/F+1
f+2
BT 2
(d/f+1),2
u/f+3+4
U/F,N+3
f,f+4 (wall stun)
3,4 (wall stun)
all jumping kicks (wall stun)
all jugglestarters near the wall - (wall stun)
WS+1 (guarantee starter)

Pretty good arsenal, don't you think? ^_^ Not to mention jugglestarters Yoshi
can steal from his opponents!!! O_O

Now the juggle fillers:   speed:        travel:      damage:      recovery:
b+1,1,1,1,1               high          medium       good         excellent
f+1                       high          short        poor         excellent
1                         high          short        poor         excellent
f,f+4                     high          medium/far   good         poor
U/F+4                     medium        medium/far   great        quite good
u/f+1                     high          short        poor         quite good
d/f+2                     medium        farther m.   very good    good
1+4                       ultra high    very short   none!        excellent
d/f+1,2~D/B+2,2           medium        far          very good    average
D/B+2,2...                medium        far          good         average
d/b+3,3,3...              slow          medium/far   quite good   poor
B+1,(1)~D/B+3,3...        high          medium/far   good         poor
etc, etc... these are most common used.

And: juggle finishers:    speed:        travel:     damage:     where used:
d/f+1,1,(1), ~D/B+3_d+1   good          upclose     excellent   upclose
f+3,3                     average       medium      excellent   upclose
4,4,4                     good          medium      great       upclose
2,3                       very good     very far    great       upclose
d/f+3,1                   average       upclose     excellent   close/medium
d/f+3                     average       upclose     good        medium
u/f+4                     average       medium      great       medium
f+3                       average       medium/far  great       medium/far
f,f+4                     excellent     medium      average     medium/far
f,f+2                     quite good    far         good        very far
f,f+1+2                   slow          very far    good        upclose
f,f+3+4                   slow          very far    great       upclose/slope

Now juggle patterns: (to make you life easier! Match the finisher looking at
the "where used" table above. Remember that for e.g. "upclose" rating, all
finishers work, whereas for medium: only finishers from medium to far...not
to mention these charts will help you evaluate the distance Yoshi covers while
executing each juggle... it's essential in using walls to inflict more damage)

After d/f+2                                 where you travel:
b+1,(1),(1),1                                   upclose (all)
b+1,(1),(1),1, b+1                              close/medium (from d/f+3,1)
b+1,(1),(1),1, b+1,1                            medium/far (from d/f+3)
b+1,(1),(1),1, b+1,1, b+1                       very far (only f,f+2)

 - light opponents:

 - d/f+2 in opponent's back:

b+1,(1),1, b+1,                                 medium/far
b+1,(1),1, b+1,(1),1                            medium/far

b+1,(1),1,(1),1, b+1                            medium/far
b+1,(1),1,(1),1, b+1,(1),1                      medium/far
 - vs Kuma (lifts only on CH!)
b+1,(1),1,                                      close
b+1,(1),1, b+1                                  close/medium
b+1,(1),1, b+1,(1),1                            medium/far

After u/f+3                                 where you travel:
f+1, b+1,                                       upclose
f+1, b+1,1                                      close/medium
f+1, b+1,1,(1),1                                medium/far
f+1, b+1,1,(1),1, b+1                           very far
 - u/f+3 in opponent's back:
f+1, b+1                                        medium/far
f+1, b+1,(1),1,(1),1                            medium/far

After SS+2
f+1                                             close/medium
d/f+1,1                                         it's a finisher!
d/f+1,2, D/B+2,2                                far, far away (no finisher)
(Near the wall, your enemy at the distance of one lying opponent from the
wall, start the juggle:
SS+2, f+1 (opponent feet forward the wall)
...and b+1,1,1,1(...) spins are possible (!!!), huge damage! ^_^ )

After CH SS+1
f+1                                             upclose
f+1, b+1                                        upclose/or!/medium (depends)
f+1, b+1,(1),1,(1),1                            medium/far (hard!)
[in this starter also the launch distance counts. If hit upclose, you have
more juggle possibilities. See SS+1 Table in Move List Analysis.]

After (3+4), 3+4
~f, f+1,                                        close

~f, f+1, b+1,1,(1),1,                           medium/far
~f, f+1, b+1,1,(1),1, b+1                       far
- vs Xiaoyu (hit f+1 early, if you want above juggles: wait a milisecond :)
~f, f+1, b+1,1, b+1,1                           far
~f, f+1, b+1,1,(1),(1),1, b+1                   far
~f, f+1, b+1,1, b+1,1,(1),(1),1                 ultra far (nothing hits)

After 4~3
(go behind) b+1,1, b+1,1,(1),(1),1              medium/far
(go behind) b+1,1, b+1,(1),1,(1),1              medium/far
[ two versions possible, figure out which one will appear during juggle ]
(go behind) b+1,1,(1),(1),1                     medium/far
(go behind) b+1,1,(1),(1),1, b+1,(1),1          far

- vs Xiaoyu, Julia
~b,b, b+1,1, b+1,(1),1                          far
[ anyway, I recommend 4~3~D/F, WS+3 versus small characters, the camera
acts really crazy against them. >_< NAAAAMCOOOO! ]

After CH WS+2
f+1, b+1,1, b+1,                                medium/far

etc...
More combos are listed in each jugglestarter's table, in Move List Analyzis
section. Why do I list these patterns? Well, it's useful in connection with
walls. If you evaluate the distance correctly, you can use the pattern which
will travel to the wall and end in spins+wall hits, or you can use the traps
after opponent's walltech (like my mentioned b,b+1 trap, which mostly hits due
to opponent's shock :P). You can also use spinning pattern that will end up
near the wall with the juggle finisher d/f+1,1,1: near the wall all three hits
are very likely to connect, not to mention Pogo Rush. :)

And now...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Oki-zeme - Yoshi's third MUSTLEARN ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yoshimitsu's Oki-zeme options has been much ripped off guaranteed stuff. But
still, you have plenty of options available. :) Of course, if you want to 
start oki-zeme techniques, you'll have to chase your opponent or just be close
to him. That's why the oki-zeme oriented juggles are those which end up with
your opponent close (like juggles ended with d/f+1,1,(1)), or which are ended
with a move that retracts very fast and travels far (f,f+2, d/f+3, etc.)

Yeah, opponent's troubles don't end as he lands on the ground after a juggle.
Heh, heh... and that's fine! ^_^

Here are most often used OKI options ( I call it "mind oki-zeme": only one
trick is guaranteed here, the rest: depends on your opponent's behaviour! ):

[ After juggle ended with d/f+3, f,f+4, f,f+2, (1+2),1+2, (1+2)~3+4 ]

(#1) It's guaranteed if done fast enough.
(#2) Can be blocked on reaction, mostly... :)
(#3) Automatic low parry in the initial phase. Later: Sword Sweep, juggle.
     The recommended juggle is simple f,f+4 to mess up a little and even
     CONTINUE your OKI options! (guaranteed u/f+3 on backroll, etc.)
     Also, you're slightly off-axis, opponent will be quite confused :)
(#4) Here you end your OKI options
(#5) ...or just anything after D/B+2, string, parry, etc... in general
     stand up is maybe the worst thing your opponent can do. :) The
     worst for Yoshi since he must be very careful with follow-ups. :)
     Anyway, D/B+2 mix-ups are the best you can do, it puts in a pressure.
     The same goes to quickroll: great way to approach an opponent with
     little chances to get hit.
(#6) Risky, can be blocked, you count on a pressure. Used if you expect
     somebody stand up or duck after roll. The same goes to ~D/F+1.
(#7) Pretty much guaranteed, catches also ~b backroll after sideroll.
     You end your OKI options, but still: chase your opponent. :)
(#8) Jump over tricks are awesome! You just run very close and jump over
     quick rolling opponent, and hit him with BT 3 as he tries any move,
     which will whiff if not timed properly. Later on your opponents
     may chose to duck your high kick, so do d+4, hopkick or jumping
     hopkick to hit any duck attempts. ^_^ Flashy! Of course you end 
     your oki options, but it's the best solution if you run too far
     after a finisher and you noticed a quickroll...
SSR  Sidestep to Yoshi's right will avoid all kicks from the ground.

     The same goes to quickroll: great way to approach an opponent with

     d/f+1,1,1 will hit. :) 
(*)  Sidestep to Yoshi's right will avoid all kicks from the ground.

More hints:
# Sideroll is very unpredictable: your opponent can do pretty much everything.
  You have no choice but chase him... or if he does it frequently, 
  immediately follow up the finisher with u/f+3+4, u+1+2, 1+2... many times
  they'll Quickroll after being stomped and hit the sword for CH damage...
# Stand up and quickroll are also very much naughty... just keep a pressure.
# Not only after juggles you have a knee guaranteed on backroll. Watch this
  characteristic animation during every backroll, in general: chase your
  opponent on every KD :) You'll learn it quickly. :)

There's also d/f+3,1 ending... it's one of the most powerful Yoshi's
juggle enders, but also one of the worst to be followed with Oki-zeme
techniques. Your best bet is to SSR and use one of the OKI options, my
favourite is the "immortal" SSR~D/B+2 + mix-ups. :P But well, your opponent 
can hit you out if it more easily.

Other juggle enders either knock your opponent far away, too far to keep a
pressure on lying opponent, or retract slowly.
Just one note: After juggle ender f+3,3~d+3+4 (Indian Sit), you have SIT->1
mostly guaranteed, it's rarely escaped! ^_^
Also: it's all about mind game. Your opponent may not attack or just block,
or he can wait and attack one second later... only the u/f+3 on backroll is
guaranteed here (and the FC,d/f+3 and f,f+2 stuff is also pretty much 
guaranteed...), the rest is up to you. Try to read your opponent. And don't
forget about low parry as you expect low jabs, or Bad Breath... a lot of
options! Experiment. :)

 == Other OKI moves ==

# d+1 - great oki-zeme move, will hit in most situations. Great reach!
# d+3 - good move, but if your opponent blocks it, you're pretty gone :)
# ~D/B+3 - as the d+3, adding that this one is faster
# u/f+1+2~D - on opponents staying on the ground, huge damage! I use it from
  time to time after d/f+3 - ended juggles, as I'm sure my opponent will
  stay on the ground. :) Great, just great, I adore it. :) I even like it
  more than Poison Wind: the Deathcopter Trick hits straight get up and
  even Quick roll (but not Quickroll-Sidestep!) and backroll (but not
  double backroll or backroll-sidestep!). Anyway, I love it, it's cool!
# d/b+3,3,3,3... - done at an angle can lift your opponent for a small 
                   juggle. Great especially in connection with wall hits.
# u/f,n,d+3 - great damage, but if you have it blocked, then big "OUCH!" :)
# u/f,n,d+4 - mix up with u/f,n,d+3 to hit opponents blocking low or trying
              any kick attack from the ground. If whiffed, you can block
              or parry easily. Also hits backroll attempts.
# Flea jump or run - great damage, especially near the wall, go for it
                    whenever you finish your juggle near the wall, especially
                    after the d/f+1,1,1 - ended juggle. 

Of course it's not all about Oki-zeme, you can also start your OKI options
after any move causing KD (like f,f+4). Anyway, if you have any other tips
and tricks to share, I would gladly add them here, credit for you of course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Unpredictibility [ deception, (false) rhythm... ] ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I mentioned it a lot of times before. To be unpredictable is the greatest wish
of all Tekken players. :) You can be unpredictable with Yoshi, too. :)

1st degree of unpredictibility is to adandon your custom string patterns. We
all have our favourite customs that we do on reaction in tight situations...
it's good to some extend, but advanced player will surely exploit it at the 
end of a round and, e.g., parry your low punch... At the beginning of your
Yoshi-adventure, make your favourite customs. Then try to be creative in 
every of your fight, work on this hard... 

2st degree of unpredictibility is your ability to implement guess-up game 
into fight. It's quite difficult since Yoshi risks almost everytime he tries 
something what's called a "set-up" or "guess-up"... he has just many 
disadvanages (that maybe aren't punishable, but successfully disable any
safe follow-up) and he doesn't have any handy stunning move. (like Jin's or 
Steve's stunning moves... would Yoshi be too good with such moves? :) Maybe 
except last Door Knocker hit, but it's hard to get a whole series on block. 
You risk, OK... but after you get used to it, you'll often see through 
opponent's intentions and guess right. :) You'll use more and more guess-up
as your experience will increase and you'll understand the physics of the 
game. (Anyway, you can always block if you're not sure, it's also a kind of
suprise for your enemy. :P Really! ^_^)

3rd degree of unpredictibility is doing all what you can NOT to repeat the
same juggle or technique all the time. Yeah, even a different juggle may
make a "oww, what's next?" thought in your opponent's head. The amount of
juggles I listed in this FAQ should be enough, you can also think of some of
your own. :) Also, "not finishing a juggle" (e.g. doing alone d/f+3... heh
heh, we know it's for oki-zeme purposes, but your opponent doesn't know :P)
is a great "what the h*** is he doing?!" thought-maker. :P Also, you can cut
your spinning juggle short or whiff a spin ON PURPOSE just to SSR any kick
attempt and score u/f+3 and next juggle... jump ovet tricks also cause a real
mess on the screen, you can use them after your juggles. :) Many times they
succeed, it's also a crowd pleaser. ^_^ Yupee, Yoshi must be rewarded for his
efforts, neh? 

4th degree of unpredictibility is enhancing your style of moving. Yeah, again
this positioning and movement, huh? :) I mentioned it already somewhere above.
The simple custom string changes its properties dramatically as you add SS
and/or dashes to it, depending on what you want to do. Sometimes a single
SideStep in the middle of a string can work like a charm and allow you even to
score a free juggle, sometimes it will be better to block, backdash or duck...
Always be opened on opponents' behaviour and try to predict what they're going
to do... but even better is to SEE what they're doing. ^_^ (more about it in 
the "Purpose" section below...)

5th degree of unpredictibility is using the false rhythm technique. Sounds
very much advanced, but in fact it's not. :P There's something in Tekken what 
I call "the rhythm of play". It's the time between sets of moves, and the 
individual speed of unleashing techniques... Many times you beat your opponent
completely after a few fights just because you have just learned when to 
interrupt him or when to attack during his pause... This is it: his rhythm. :)
You also have your individual rhythm, and it's good. :) But it's even better 
to break it from time to time. :P Especially as you feel that your opponent
magically knows where to attack. :P It should be spontaneous, just pause for
a moment where you usually do an attack, or do one or two SideSteps, dashes
or backdashes more... don't end your favourite custom string... duck for the
second time... leave the upclose position just to attack from the medium
distance... immediately shorten the distance... rush in and immediately stop..
I think you know what I mean. It will help you win many times, it causes a 
real mess, can help you evade opponent's moves or parry/reversal...
Also, changing the rhythm is switching to offensive from defensive and
vice versa. :) 

6th degree of unpredictibility lies in your personal intelligence. ^_^ Just to
put everything together and use it wisely, as you see an opening (or not :P).
Don't forget about the Flash Stealing Tool, it's also great to make a real
mess on the screen. ^_^ Yoshi is a tricky ninja after all :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Purpose [ seeing openings, reading opponent, using walls... ] ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unpredictibility and purpose are not the opposites. You might want to do 
something and be unpredictable in reaching your aim. Just a single thought. :)

The purpose of your gameplay should consist of the following features:
 - concentrate on opponent's gameplay.
 - use openings, opponent's disadvantages.
 - use your techniques to read your opponent.
 - knock down or/and juggle.
 - keep a pressure, don't let your opponent think.
 - make use of walls and slopes.
 - be spontaneous, mobile, unpredictable.

1. Concentrate on opponent's gameplay.
I know that we all love Yoshimitsu's appearance, his cute wings or superb 
demon armour... but we should really track opponent's movement and do not pay
attention to what Yoshi does on the screen... Sounds simple, neh? Well, if
you can't stand watching your opponent all the time, just record your fights
and then have lots of fun watching Yoshi. :) 
Opponent and his movement should be all your world during the fight, only in
this stance you'll see his moves and evaluate his disadvantages. Second place
belongs to surrounding, third: to Yoshimitsu and his alingment. :) But I do
not mean the concentration in a common sense: well... you have to see 
opponent's actions but at the same time be awared of the surrounding and
your positioning. Also, you should react quickly only if you actually SEE
and RECOGNIZE the move. Do not act on single duck or SideStep, because 
it can be a fake. 

2. Use openings, opponent's disadvantages.
If your opponent has a disadvantage, why not to exploit it? Well, but you
have to know for sure that he has it... some moves look as if opponent was
defenceless, but in fact he can e.g. enter a highly evading stance (like 
Xiaoyu, Lee). Some moves seem to be safe due to huge stagger, but in fact if
you're quick enough, you can punish your opponent... You just have to know it,
and I'll try to make a list of opponent's "guaranteed" disadvantages after 
blocking a certain move.
The rest depends on many things, like the distance at which you blocked a move
or done justframe version, etc.... 
As far as openings: you'll see more and more of them as your experience will
raise. You'll have to beware of opponent's traps, though, he may make you
think he's defenceless and, as you attack, quickly retaliate or parry... of
course, their own fake openings are the double edged sword (as well as your
own ^_^), you can wait, SS, make them whiff... mind game, indeed.

3. Use your techniques to read your opponent.
It's not only all about guess-up techniques... you can notice opponent's 
favourite reaction on almost every move Yoshi possesses! Even against your
movement. :) Just examples:
 - as you quickly shorten the distance: what's a favourite opponent's reaction?
 - as you SideStep after this or that move: how does he act?
 - What is he trying to do near the wall?
 - What's his favourite way of standing up?
 - How does he act if backturned?
 - As you do this or that move: what's his reaction?
 - After he does this or that move: what's his favourite follow-up?... etc.
 - In which situations to expect low moves?
 - Does he try any guess-up?
Of course he'll try to read you, too... In the higher level of play you won't
see two similar sets of moves during one round or even fight. :)

As you try a guess-up, mind that (judging from my experience...):
- if somebody is intermediate, he'll fall prey to the same technique about
  three times or more.
- if somebody is advanced, he'll not be fooled for the second or third time
  with the same trick.
- if somebody is highly advanced, he'll know that what you're trying to do is
  a guess-up and will try to see what's coming. Sometimes doing the same for
  the second time succeeds. :P LOL... but only sometimes!!! ^_^ 

My favourite moves destined to read my opponent:
D/B+1+2~any 
D/B+2~SS at the distance
D/B+2 upclose, block, watch... ^_^
SS+1 
3+4,b (pause) 3+4 (highly encouraging... they'll be awared that next 3+4 may
come and hunt for the occasion... well, you don't have to do the second 3+4,
your opponent most likely will approach you gradually, waiting for the second
Meditation... heh heh.)
d/b+3,3, f+4
Indian Sit
SS, dash in REALLY upclose, watch opponent's reaction.
Oki-zeme after juggles is all about watching opponent's reactions!
1,1,... jabs, including SS and pauses: do they duck? Retaliate? Try a parry?
d/f+1,1 - duck? backdash? SS? Retaliation try?
throw (escaped) - what do they do?
u/f+3+4,d+3+4 - 90% of moves will whiff :)
dash~b+3+4 (whiff-maker ^_^)
b+1~b+3+4 (whiff-maker ^_^)
duck, stand up with block, SS, duck again... - any mid move?

etc, etc... you can read your opponent constantly, even without thinking about
it much: it will be automatical. :P

4. Knock down or/and juggle.
Yoshi is NOTHING without juggles, the damage he inflicts by his "on the
ground" moves is close to nothing. ^_^ Throw your safe jugglestarters here and
there, and make set-ups/see openings for the more risky ones... try to counter
your opponent with stunners, evade his jabs/throws by Bad Breath, SS a lot
and use basic uppercut randomly, with different timing. Due to Yoshi's strong
game in the medium distance, switch to close distance to:
- begin a custom string (good way to stop your opponent's techniques for a 
  moment and even try little guess-up)
- set-up Sword Sweep FC,b_D/F+1
- set-up Samurai Knee
- throw
You don't have to hurry much. :) Stay in the medium distance and use your
powerful SS moves, d/f+4 far ranging poke, f,f+4, Basic uppercut, Stances,
etc., juggle your opponent if you connect a jugglestarter... use oki-zeme and
chase your opponent to keep a pressure... and as you have a good mood you can
start your upclose warfare. :)

4. Keep a pressure, don't let your opponent think.
Yeah, we talked about keeping a pressure after juggles or during custom 
strings... but you should also constantly attack from the medium distance.
Constantly doesn't neccessarily mean "blow after blow", don't forget about
little motion fakes and false rhythm, and of course about your disadvantages. 
Anyway, even sitting in the Indian Sit and standing up keeps a pressure. :) 
Your opponent is concentrated on your movement and tries to build the way to 
attack in his mind... but as he sees more and more moves and no pattern at 
all, he can become quite frustrated. :) Also, as he doesn't attack but wait,
you can chose to encourage him to attack or close the gap by yourself.

5. Make use of walls and slopes.
Of course. :) You can use your environment to:
 - make more powerful juggles (spins + wall hits, Door Knocker on the slope..)
 - use walls for your walltech traps
 - push somebody on the wall and take some damage
 - predict your opponent's behaviour (he can constantly sidestep from the
   slope knowing your damaging techniques, he may chose to run away from the
   wall...)
 - keep a pressure 
My favourite wall techniques are all about juggling my opponent to the wall
and either connect with even more spins enriched with wall hits, or knock
my opponent to the ground near the wall and keep a pressure (usually by using
unblockable Sword Sweep, parry or mid-low guess-up). Also, connecting f+2
if your opponent is near the wall or even at the distance, but with his back
turned to the wall, is extremely devastating. You can try f+2 after successful
SideStep (opponent whiffs) or after far push. See f+2 Section far above :)

6. Be spontaneous, mobile, unpredictable.
... and the most important thing: be YOURSELF! ^_^ 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Why I didn't bothered with offensive, defensive strategies... ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why? The answer is simple. Firstly, Yoshi can be played both offensively and
defensively with ease, he's extremely well balanced. Secondly: the way you'll
play Yoshi depends on your feeling. If you are doing better being defensive,
I won't force you to play at the offensive... :) Also, I think that the terms
"offensive, defensive" aren't very clear. Sometimes you won't be able to tell
one style from another... 
Anyway, in my opinion the way you play should depend on situation or on the 
character you're playing against. Being only offensive or only defensive is 
definitely not good since you won't be prepared for every situation, and 
sometimes one style of playing will not be enough to win a match. Well, it's
so much basic... :) At the beginning of this FAQ I said something about 
"defensive" style of playing, catching the occasion, etc. It's good, but you
will see that "defensive" is not all what Yoshi can do. 
In previous Tekkens Yoshi was all-about-attack man. :) Changing the properties
of his 1+4 flash made him be a bit more defensive, not to mention weaker
damage and priority of f,f+4 and extended defensive stances. But still, I 
would give Yoshi this rating:
 - Yoshi is 60% attack, 40% "defense"
Heh heh, I wrote "defense" because Yoshi in fact attacks even if he actually
evades something. :) Or: evasive maneuver can be a set-up for more damage.
Just to mention Bad Breath, Roo Kick, u/b+4, u/f+3, SS+1 or SS+2... (in 
general a lot of moves ducking under high ones!). His keep away game is also
great (d/b+1, d/f+4, f,f+4, even 1+4). He's well balanced, and that's what
I love in his style. 
Anyway, I would like to give you some pieces of advice. :)

1. Playing offensively gives you plenty of advantages. You are at the attack
   and, if you're really good at it, you're controlling the match with your
   fast moves and pokes. It's also a good way to read your opponent. It brings
   best results if your opponent isn't turtling much. Yoshi is a counter-man,
   heh heh, he has a lot of moves that duck something, juggle or stun on CH...
   Anyway, against turtlers you can also try your offensive strategies, but
   use the most safe fakes and fast-recovering moves. (I'm talking about 
   advanced turtlers, who know the physics of the game very well... in fact 
   standard turtlers will eat even your suicide without any sophisticated 
   set-up. :) They're very easy to defeat, but well... I want you to be 
   prepared for the worse). Use Side Step moves if only you're sure they'll
   at least connect on a block, and try your guess-up :) Especially parry
   traps... firstly try to see their reactions, (do not hurry much ^_^,
   you have at least one round for it! ^_^ Repeat two or three (or more) 
   situations to use them later and exploit just as they should be :P) then 
   (if they use low punch mostly) go for parry little strats. :)
   Anyway, I think that playing offensively with Yoshi is really a great fun,
   he has a great arsenal of moves that are quite safe. Just use them. :)
   Judging from my experience, playing in this style really helps you win.
   After two or three correctly used guess-up traps in a row or even just 
   a few right connected jugglestarters or combostarters, your opponent
   already doesn't have about 60% of his lifebar! It looks really like a 
   merciless boom-slash-slam chain of moves, with fast pokes and deceptive
   strings that your opponent must be awared of adding that he can't do
   much anything besides blocking and watching... :) I have such situations 
   as I concentrate deeply and use all what I know. Remember that Yoshi must
   land more blows to win than e.g. Paul. The damage he takes on the flat 
   ground is average if not poor. :) Not to mention it looks very scary from
   the eyes of your opponent as he falls prey to that massive chain of hits.

2. Yoshi at the defensive is also a very good fighter. Just to mention Bad
   Breath, fast pokes, far ranging pokes (d/f+4), keep aways (like f,f+4),
   opponent repellent (1+4), b+3+4, Indian Sit, etc... af for me, this style
   of playing is not the opposite of offensive: it's a supplement! You should
   know where to retreat not to be hit, when to wait for opponent's move to
   avoid it, block (and hopefully use the disadvantage)... of course sometimes
   you'll be forced to play a whole game defensively... or sometimes you'll 
   just feel like playing defensively all the time. ^_^ It's good to run
   around your opponent and wait for openings for d/f+2 or u/f+3... but well,
   is it that satisfying? Because it is in fact efficient especially if your
   reflexes and ability to SS are brilliant. You'll be bored after some time.
   In my opinion it's much better to mix up offensive and defensive strategies
   for maximum unpredictibility and efficience. You can wait for the occasion
   also while attacking. :) Not to mention it encourages your opponent to
   attack (especially if he sees your pseudo-openings), and here you can make
   use of your "defensive" maneuvers to exploit opponent's actions. All your
   defensive tools can be also used at the offensive. :) (e.g. beginning the
   round with Bad Breath is in fact playing offensive, don't you think? ^_^) 
   Well, to stop making a real mess: everything depends on the point of view.
   As for me, defensive is only waiting for your opponent. And Yoshi shouldn't
   be played in this way. He must take advantage from the very beginning!
   If you don't know what to do: throw in a random juggle starter. If you miss,
   SS and throw, if you miss: d/b+1, WS+4, then SS... and hey! You'll suddenly
   find yourself at the offensive :) Just don't wait for your opponent in the 
   spot. Attack, dodge, bait, attack...and encourage him to attack. :) Dance!
   Encouraging is also your initiative, so I consider it to be offensive
   technique. :) Attack and dodge fluently, encourage and forestall... this is
   Yoshi! The mix of all the good (which just wait to be discovered!). 
   The perfect balance!

 Remember:
  - Great positioning + Good custom strings = annoying Yoshi
  - Annoying Yoshi + Juggling = frustrating Yoshi
  - Frustrating Yoshi + Oki-zeme = scary Yoshi
  - Scary Yoshi + Deception = monstrous Yoshi
  - Monstrous Yoshi + Unpredictibility + Purpose = Manji Fighting Demon :)
  - Manji Fighting Demon + knowing opponent + wall game = ...
                        
                ... The unstoppable, marvellous Yoshimitsu! :P

Heh heh heh... anyway, the most important thing is to have fun with Yoshi. :)
Do never get frustrated or discouraged from uncovering his mysteries. He's
really a cute type and will surely give you many exciting fights in exchange!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================
= [8] :: Know Your Enemy!!! ::
==============================================================================

By having the Soul Stealer, Yoshi wants to teach us that other characters are
very important to reach the ultimate victory. In fact Tekken is all about
using your skills to see through opponent's game style, and defeat him using
his own habits or impulses. If you'll look at Tekken in this way, it will be
the never ending pleasure. :)

I'm awared that my own experience is not all what we, Yoshi players, can tell
about other characters... :P That's why I ask you for support. I don't play 
versus all characters, and even if: not versus players who have their char
learned up and down. There's still much to learn...
I also would be glad to add here any nice "after-steal" juggles or set-ups.
I don't use flash too often, mainly as a shield, and anyway: my opponents also
use "false rhythm" techniques. :)

But first, I'll make a list of types of players. Well, we all love such
a summaries, huh? :)

MASHER
This player doesn't know a game at all. He either mashes all buttons possible
or has just discovered a nice blow (e.g. There were a lot of Heihachi mashers
in Tekken 3 times: just b+2 all over the game. :P). Sometimes you'll find also
"intelligent mashers" that will mash only if they see an opening. Anyway, they
are quite easy to defeat. BUT if they're Steve punch-mashers, you can have 
some problems. :P Especially if they mash directions together with punches and
sometimes hit kick buttons by mistake. :P They're quite unpredictable. :P
Defeat from the hands of a masher is a dishonour, heh heh. :) 

BEGINNER
He knows some blows of a character, but doesn't know what's the custom string,
usually doesn't use basic punches, and usually uses the hits that are in his
opinion good and mix them together. More "advanced" beginner will already
know hit ranges and have a nice mix-up up the sleeve, but they're very much
predictable. Sometimes you'll find a throw-abusers in the beginner group...
They're maybe easier to defeat that mashers, they're VERY much predictable.
Beginners often fall prey to Yoshi because they think that Yoshi is weak, 
judging from low CPU Yoshi AI... heh heh HEH. :) (sorry, it's only my
Yoshi-like always-good-mood-and-humour :P)

INTERMEDIATE
This type of player still may not know that if a player picks Kuma, Combot or
Yoshi, he may be highly advanced. :) Intermediate already knows which chars
are the strongest in the game, you can see the beginning of what you can call
"game style". Intermediates know characters' movelists but lack in experience
versus many characters, and still may not know the power of jabs and custom
strings. They of course read some FAQs, but they're in the middle of learning
how to use the FAQ information in the heat of a battle.
Also, they may use some combos after launchers, they also know the char's
guarantees and use them in the battle. They use SideSteps only sometimes, e.g.
as you approach them (and usually the SS ends up with a throw).
You shouldn't have much problems against them, but well: they can already
know a lot of dangerous mix-ups from the just-read FAQs. ^_^

ADVANCED
You can see if a player is advanced or not judging from his behaviour and
movement on the arena. Advanced players will move smoothly using dashes and
sidesteps, all the moves they use have a destination, they use a wide amount
of combos and also their own set-ups. They don't fear being near the wall.
Also, they can make a guess-up out of almost everything they can: strings,
oki-zeme, combos, wall game... they can play both pitt-bull offensive game and
turtle defensive one, depending on situation. They like experimenting, and if
you allow them to do so, they'll be in fact very dangerous and unpredictable.
They don't have any patterns in custom strings (although there may be some
that are their favourite), have great reflexes and learn your gamestyle very
fast. If they're also cold-blooded and don't lose hope, they're extremely
dangerous. Many times they'll win having only 10% of a lifebar, beware!
As they read you well, they'll soon or later score perfects. :) 

MASTER
This player knows every character and is always hungry to know more. His
reflexes and ability to learn are marvellous, he's able to read you just after
one round! His gameplay is all about guess-up and guaranteed stuff, he'll
constantly force you to the wall to finish a round quickly. He suprises, and
smashes, and gives you no mercy. Sometimes you won't be able to even tack a 
single jab if he's upclose. :P Masters have perfect timing and do not commit
mistakes more than once a round. :) You can't beat them out of concentration,
they're the machines programmed to win. Advanced players will take one or two
rounds, but a final fight is always theirs. :P They're incredible, you should
play with them frequently to learn their gamestyle and the way of moving.
Only if playing with people better than you, your style will improve.

Now some types of gameplay:

PITT BULL
Attack, ATTACK! This kind of player has offensive style of playing down. He'll
use fast jabs combined with fast mid pokes to prevent you from ducking, he'll
constantly lower your lifebar, point by point. You have not choice but stop
his string and play pitt-bull by yourself, using your custom strings. Many
times they won't allow you to use more sophisticated guess-up game due to
abused d/b+1 low punches. Try to low parry them. Also, pitt-bulls love using
parry and hopkicks, so beware... their defensive game is mainly d/b+1 go-away,
SS evade to jugglestarter/throw or parry. The rest is attack, attack...
To sum up: stop his custom string with jab/low jab/flash (beware of parry!)
and give them no chance to start their offensive techniques again...
Also, Yoshi is a "counter man", so you can use a lot of SideStep moves here.
All of them have high priority and cause stun/juggle, so it also can be
your cure. Just do not allow the Pitt Bull come close to you, and you should
be fine... Anyway, always a nice player to fight with, to learn things...

TURTLER
AAAARGH! I hate them! JUST HATE! They have great reflexes and SideStep, 
backdash game down, they'll just wait for you, SS to make you whiff or just
block and use your disadvantage to start their guess-up or offensive game.
Their go-away game is extremely frustrating, they'll most likely d/b+1 any
approach attempt, or SS (whiff)+ jugglestarter, or throw (mainly 1+2 escape),
etc. You have to encourage them to attack or use their own turtling techniques
to show them how much irritating their gamestyle is. They'll then most likely
call you "cheap", but don't worry: you only used their own techniques. :P
Encouraging to attack... you can try WS+1 or WS+4 whiff, Indian Sit (beware, 
they will most likely dash~backdash, so be careful with teleports), b+1~3+4, 
Meditation Step (cautious!) ... You can also chase their SS with D/B+2,(2) or
quick d/f+2, or u/f+3 (the Samurai Knee hits sidestep very nicely, but don't
become predictable). You can also run-up~low parry if you face d/b+1 abusers.
Also, "dash ~ SS ~ do-nothing" is a nice encouraging tool, heh heh heh. :P
Single hit by d+1 should also encourage them to attack, just beware SS. Also,
Sword Sweep FC,D/F+1 works like a charm against them, especially if they
expect FC,d/f+3. Do the lunging sweep a couple of times, then switch to this.
A very tough fight... this type of player is highly frustrating. :) I wish
the "chicken" mark would come back in Tekken 5!

MASTER-STYLE
All in one, that is offensive mixed up with defensive, depending on opponent's
behaviour. But offensive is always better than defensive style of playing. 
They use offensive to read you well, learn your reactions, experiment... then, 
usually in second round, they start the massacre. :) You must not repeat used
techniques, and if you happen to repeat something two times, don't do it for
the third time... well, mind game is here on the highest level. The best is to
make them think you're not advanced. ^_^ Hard to explain... but if a master
knows you're advanced, he'll be extremely hard to defeat. As he thinks you're
not, he'll be more relaxed and likely to fall in the patterns... You can 
try the bread-and-butter repeated guess-ups to make him feel comfortable, and
then switch to more aggressive, random style. Shock is good. :P
Anyway, you have to learn as quickly as your opponent does to win. If he 
escapes your guess-up for the third time, try something new... if your 
low-mid guess-up fails, do the unblockable... try to be smarter than him. :)
If you win with a master, it means that either he had a bad day or you're 
at least a highly advanced player. LOL! "bad day" :P Hey, "shit happens!" ^_^


                And now: VS CHARACTERS Strategies and tips. :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Yoshimitsu, baby! ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oww, tough fight! If you're taking part in the tournament, and somebody picks
Yoshi, remember that actually in Tekken 4 he must be either an expert or a
total Yoshi-maniac, who doesn't care about lost. It's a "who's better" fight!
Be awared that he can use his suicide, his unblockables at the end of the 
round, and in general: be smarter than him. :) Observe his gamestyle, there's
always something new to learn. I've seen many Yoshis, and each duel taught me
lots of things... 
Yoshi versus Yoshi is also a fight of honour, :) just do your best! ^_^ If you
happen to lose, don't give up: you'll lose HUNDREDS of matches to master him, 
it's the only way to be more and more better. And: Yoshi is such a characer
that you'll never stop learning... nice, huh? :)
Because this is Yoshi FAQ, I won't list here his disadvantages... try to
find them by yourself! The expert player knows them for sure...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Jin Kazama ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jin - overpowered again... why does Namco love this guy so much? Heh, he's so
'pretty' that he looks artificial. He doesn't have a "character" at all.
But his fighting arts must be respected and well-anticipated.
"Three flats" Jin possesses :) [b,f+2,1,2] has now a justframe, which you must
see. It's an unblockable, well.. but it can be SideStepped to either of Jin's
sides. I recommend SS to Jin's left, not only because the JF will miss, but
also ALL endings will miss. And that's fine! Just hold the direction to Jin's
left as he does the second punch, and you should be fine. As you perform a SS,
and Jin does a JF, you can even score a free backthrow. Nice, huh? :)
Good Jin players love doing parry to d+3+4. Just make them think that after a
parry they have it guaranteed, and after you block d+3+4, do f+2, b+1, 2+4.
It has GREAT disadvantage if blocked. E.g. Parried d/f+2 or d/b+2 has little 
recovery time. (and all blows up to Badv -6)
Also, you can steal his moves, especially his 1,2,3 string, which is good as
a juggle filler. :) Flash immediately after 1,2 to steal a move. Don't worry,
if Jin does 1,2,4, Flash either won't come off or will steal it too. Just do
NOT mash the flash command.
What else? After his low parry, most feared is b,f+2,1:2, because it's mostly
guaranteed... in fact Yoshi and Xiaoyu can escape it. Flash immediately after
b,f+2,1 to stop the justframe. (Just why can't Yoshi steal this move, huh?)
Jin's blows are safe, has many staggers and are strong. That's what Yoshi's
blows don't have. (just wonder why the H***?! Yoshi is a ninja after all!)
You have to play a mind game if fighting against Jin. As he does parry: do a
throw instead, as he tries 2,4 (most overpowered series ever): do a Bad 
Breath... Try to Roo Kick him inbetween his high strings, if he will be
dumb enough to start b,f+2,1,2 at the distance, do u/b+4 to kick him back,
for example. Try to see his low moves, and you should be fine... and beware
near the walls: his JF is deadly since you can't escape by SS!!! (you can
escape it by 1+4 flash, but what if Jin does a "normal" ending? If you'll
flash, it will hit you... you can do a flash on reaction: that is - block
at first, and as soon as you see this blue shine: flash. Well, it's very
difficult to do in the heat of a battle, but possible. :) Just as you see
this little delay, lasting about 0,5 second, press a flash. You can still
hold B, it doesn't matter, flash can be done by either 1+4 or b+1+4.

Summary and Guarantees:
Jin: 1,3~3, 3(blocked) - you have f,f+4
Jin: WS+2(blocked, not whiffed!) - you have f,f+4
Jin: d/f+1,4~4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 and juggle
Jin: 2,1,4~4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 and juggle
Jin: d+3+4(blocked) - you have f+2, b+1, throw or d/f+2 juggle... etc.
Jin: b+3,4(blocked) - you have u/f+3, juggle
Jin: d+3,3(blocked) - you have u/f+3, juggle
Jin: d/f+4(blocked) - you have f+2, b+1, throw or d/f+2 any juggle... etc.
Jin: d+4(blocked - you have u/f+3, juggle.
Don't forget to predict 2,4 and duck it: you can do everything with Jin :P
1,2,3 and 1,2,4 : Flash is your cure.
b,f+2,1,2: if you score this on CH, don't forget to escape a stun pressing ~F.
b,f+2,1,2: during 1 press and HOLD a direction towards Jin's left to SS the 
ending. After this immediately u/f+3 for a juggle. Easy as pie.
Watch his low moves, you can either parry them (and u/f+3) or block-u/f+3.
Block any moves after his staggers or try to d/b+1 them (in case of 1,2,3), or
do a 1+4 flash to break Jin's rhythm.

Often used techniques:
# Jins love their parry, just be cold-blooded and do a throw instead. :) :P
# b,f+2,1:2 after low parry: do as I told you above.
# b,f+2,1:2 near the wall after push: flash is your saviour. :)
# After any stagger expect his u/f+1+2 throw, jugglestarter, laser scraper or
  jabs. You can try either u/b+4 (if not followed with jabs), or sit down and
  teleport. You can also try d/b+1, but jabs will hit you if done fast enough.
  Also, a low kick (e.g. d+4) may come. You can try to immediately SS to your
  right after stagger. Nice thing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Ling Xiaoyu/Miharu Hirano ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another good character... if we compare Yoshi and Xiao, we'll see that the 
average of speed/mix/strength/priority is way, WAY higher for Xiaoyu! Just
"What the F***?!" - I may ask. She can land in her AoP just about after ANY
blow, making all what you want to throw at her MISS completely, even your MID
blows! Only u/f+3, SS+1 tend to hit her most often, but it's too slow if she
does her Rain Dance variations. Also LOW blows will miss her AoP, beware! She
does a tiny step aside, nothing can hit her during this animation, is it a bug
or something? You can beat her out of it by d/b+3,3... at a small distance, or
be smart, do a 3+4,b or a simple backdash, and attack with the Deathcopter. 
If you're out of her reach, feast her with your d+1... do a lot of Spin~evade
if you think she'll fall prey to this, and be the ONE who encourages HER to
attack. :) Use more f,f+4 than before, and stay at the medium distance... 
there's not match with her mid-low custom strings upclose.
Anyway: beware. Expert Xiaoyu players are extremely dangerous. Play a safe
game and sidestep a lot. :) Don't get mesmerized by her movement just in 
front of you, don't hold "B" all the time because it's the worst thing you 
can do. Attack with high-priority moves or sidestep... and use flash 1+4 to 
beat her out of rhythm. If a Xiaoyu player falls into fighting passion: 
you're gone :P On the other hand: if Yoshi falls into fighting passion... :P

Guarantees:
Xiao: f+3(blocked) - you have u/f+3, but it's better to do 1,2,1 since 3 and 
f+3 are almost the same in animation, but different in frame recovery.
Xiao: d/b+4(blocked) - you have WS+4
Xiao: d/f+3(blocked) - you have f,f+4
Xiao: 1,d+2,1+2(blocked) - you have 4,4 or 1,2,1...
Xiao: d+3,4(blocked) - you have u/f+3, juggle
Xiao: BT 4(blocked, in any series) - you have u/f+3, juggle.
Xiao: B+4,4 - it's good to do d/f+4, but it's not guaranteed.
Xiao: Rain Dance f+3+4~3+4(blocked) - do u/f+3,f+1, b+1, f+3 or d/b+1, WS+4
Xiao: Rain Dance 4(blocked) - you have also d/f+2 and juggle.
Xiao: Rain Dance d+3(blocked) - you have u/f+3,f+1, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, f+3
Xiao: Rain Dance 3 (blocked) - you have f,f+2, which can hit on CH as she 
tries something, and on normal hit follow up with d/b+1, FC,d/f+3
Xiao: Art of Phoenix 2,1(blocked) - you have 1,2,1
Xiao: Art of Phoenix ~1+2(blocked) - you have 1,2,1 or 4,4 (+10-string? :). In
case of 1+2 (not immediately after AoP), only 1,2,1 is guaranteed.
Xiao: Art of Phoenix u/f+3(blocked) - 1,2,1 or u/f+3... but beware the 4 or 3
follow-up kick!!! It will hit you if you try to punish Xiao.
Xiao: Art of Phoenix U/F+3(blocked) - anything! u/f+3 +JG or FC,d/f+3 +JG...
Xiao: Art of Phoenix 3+4(blocked) - you have 4,4
Xiao: Art of Phoenix 4(blocked) - you have d/f+4
Xiao: Art of Phoenix u+4,4(blocked) - you can beat her out of the second 4 
with d/f+1,1,(1), ... or d/b+1 will stop anything. The same goes to 1+4.

Often used techniques:
# try to anticipate her old-school "BT low punch" custom strings, she has a
lot of set-ups to do it. Try to parry her low punches to break her string and
make her lose her calmness. Anyway, you can always backdash and retaliate
with fast, mid move such as d/f+4.
Here are most often used low strings:
2,1, BT d+1
d/f+1, BT d+1
1,d+2, BT d+1
u+1, BT d+1
You can also chose to immediately SS after these strings and retaliate as soon
as Xiao whiffs her low punch. E.g. you can use SS~u/f+3 or SS+1. 
# Rain Dance f+3+4~3+4(blocked), she loves to continue it with another f+3+4,
which makes 99% of your moves whiff... the u/f+3 immediately after blocking 
the kick is your best option, it's pretty much guaranteed.
# Expect her Aop after any hit that may seem to leave her at the disadvantage.
# After 4~3 SHE has the ADVANTAGE, and so often used is low punch or WS+4.
  Low parry the punch, or SSR (important! SS to the other side won't help) as
  you expect WS+4. Or just SSR any time and punish whiff with a move of your
  choice, SSR~u/f+3 as an example. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Paul Phoenix ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Paul is really too strong! Return of the Tekken 3 times? Yeah, but why
didn't the old strength return to all the characters? >_< You're forced to
play defensively versus expert Paul players. Upclose he has just too strong
jabs which he can mix up with hopkick or just d/f+1. The jabs have just about
too good reach comparing to Yoshi's ones. The priority is also overpowered.
In the medium distance Paul will try to evade/Sway everything you may want to
throw at him, with this special movement art he'll often succeed... and land
a free Deathfist after you whiff something. The Deathfist can be punished 
only sometimes, don't be fooled with -17 disadvantage, it pushes you far, far
away and only in certain situations you can punish it with d/f+2 or f,f+4...
you'll have to feel it, to know different types of this back stagger by 
yourself. Paul will never do the deathfist without purpose (because it can
be easily SideStepped). He'll wait, and bait, and poke you out... and d+1
you to death near the wall, just as Heihachi...
Not to mention he has a lot of throws with great priority and combined escape.
Learn his throws, the way he shouts in each animation to break them well.
Don't forget about his reversal, as well... I still think that the gain/lose
parameter of the reversal is too high, he can score a whooping 30 points 
and lose about 10 in case of chicken, that's unfair. Everybody should have 
such reversal, Yoshi used to have even a better one... (*sigh...*)
Also, some of Yoshi's standard jugges don't fit Paul, LOL! (tend to whiff)
Fortunately, Paul has some disadvantages.
You can punish his d+1+2 by your d/f+2 and juggle. Yai! Goodbye d+1+2-happy
players! If Paul player relies on this mainly, it will spoil his strategy.
The justframe d+1,4,2:1(+2) also has a great weak point. You can d/f+2 under
the upcoming justframe blow!!! It's a marvellous trick, looks also great. :)
Not only d/f+2, but also u/f+3 fits there nicely. And you have a juggle!
You can steal his moves, especially Deathfist recommended. You can whiff WS+4
or WS+1 almost at no risk, and follow it up with a Flash to steal the upcoming
deathfist. Also, the spins~evade move is great to make the Deathfist whiff,
well.. it makes most of Paul's moves whiff. :)
Do a Bad Breath a lot, especially under jabs, and try to trick him into parry.
Indian Sit will also evade Deathfist, just don't sit for too long because 
Shredder u/f+3,4 or d+1+2 will beat you down... note that if you manage to
teleport Shredder, you'll most likely score a Backthrow. :)
d+1,2 can be outpoked inbetween by a low jab d/b+1, or sidestepped to Paul's
left.... or even right. :) But I recomment the jabbing out.
Good luck! heh heh heh....

Guarantees:
Paul: d+1+2(blocked) - you have d/f+2 +JG
Paul: d+1+4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 +JG
Paul: QCF+2(blocked) - you have d/f+2 +JG, but only if blocked upclose
Paul: WS+2(blocked) - you have d/f+2 +JG, but only if blocked upclose
Paul: d+1,2(blocked) - you have d/f+2 +JG, but only if blocked close. You can
also interrupt the 2 with d/b+1 inbetween, no matter the ending. It can be
SSed to both Paul's sides.
Paul: d+1,4,2(blocked) - you have d/f+2 +JG, no matter Paul tries the JF
blow after it. Uppercut will duck the JF blow. Also u/f+3 possible...
Paul: d+4:2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 +JG or 4,4, no matter JF or not. But if
Paul tries a JF 1 or 1+2 after it, you'll most likely get hit. Just wait.
Paul: f,f+2(blocked) - you have d/f+2 +JG or f+2, b+1, 2+4...
Paul: f,f+2,1(blocked) - you have d/f+2 +JG. Also possible after these elbows
in other Paul's series, like from FC or Sway to Low Kick...
Paul: 2,3(blocked) - you have 1,2,1, but who'll use this?
Paul: 2,d+3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 +JG, but who'll use this? Do NOT think
it's 1,4 reverse PDK, because Paul will block your knee. :)
Paul: d/b+3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 +JG
Paul: d+4(blocked) - you have ...just about anything! ^_^
Paul: u/f+3,4(blocked) - you have 1,2,1, mostly guaranteed :)
Paul: f,f+3,4(blocked) - you have 1,2,1 after it and you'll interrupt any 
ending. Also, 1+4 flash to steal the shredders. :)
etc, etc... the above moves are most often used by players.

Often used techniques:
# Some Pauls use Reverse PDK a lot: just parry the low kick, wherever you have
  the chance. It's clearly visible.
# DON'T whiff any move or you'll be feasted with Deathfist. 
# As Paul is in trouble, he'll 95% use his jabs from the distance, hoping
  to close the gap and massacre you in the fast custom string. Bad Breath it!
# Pauls love using d+1+2, but after a few guaranteed juggles you'll most
  likely never see this move again. :) So: as Paul is in trouble, it's even
  more probable that he'll use jabs instead.
# against Sways, dash forward but don't attack. Or: dash forward and do D/B+2
  spins, which will hit any Sway technique or even the Sway itself.
# Pauls love buffering throws into their jabs, beware! Most often used is the
  f,f+1+2 throw. Also, it's the most probable throw if done from the distance.
# Be cautious near the wall, you can duck for a second to trick Paul into
  doing his d+1+2 or any other mid move, immediately stand and block it, and
  juggle him... Don't raise with a kick near the wall! Make some room with 
  your jabs and try to escape from a corner with a wall jump, anyway...
# Paul usually starts his match with d+1+2... block and exploit the disadv.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Julia Chang ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, she's all about her elbows, and some guess-up after d/b+1 (hopkick or
FC, d/f+4,3?)... she can be dangerous in right hands, though.
A nice techinque of hers is also Sidestep to 3~4 (SS+3~4). It evades a lot of
moves and juggles, leaving her at the considerable disadvantage if blocked 
(enough for some jabs, but only if you're fast enough. This move pushes away)
Julias also use a lot of throws and will surely try to fit in f+1 flash upper
under your jabs. Your guess-up D/B+2 is pretty much useless against f,f+1
abusers...After her f,f+1 your d/b+1 is faster than her, but beware parry.
As you think Julia may do parry, switch to Sword Sweep...
Many Julias I fought against use the "Mad Axes" throw near the wall. Just
push, jab and Mad Axes... but anyway, it's not that sure, because a stunning
hopkick may come... not to mention this hopkick takes 25 points of damage! O_O
Adding the wall hit and 25-point follow-up... well, heh heh... huge damage.
Also, after b+3 or d+4 may come the MID skyscraper kick, it's a nice mid-low
guess-up, but quite easy to anticipate.
Learn her series to see where comes a low kick, and parry it. It's quite easy
to spot. After her WS+2 she will often do that JF stunning 2: you can out poke
it easily between WS+2 and 2 by d/b+1. But if she does a normal WS+2,2... oops!

Guarantees (often used blows):
Julia: WS+4(blocked) - you have d/f+2 or u/f+3 + JG
Julia: f+1(blocked) - you have f+4,4 or u/f+3 + JG

etc... 

Often used techniques:
# elbow, elbow, elbow (yaaawn!), elbow...
# f,f+1 and hopkick for your d/b+1 attempt. They also like parrying your low
  punches, beware. Also, after some successful parries, they do f,f+1, d/b+1
  by theirselves.:P
# They will SS your move and do a guess-up: throw_or_SS+3~4.
# Near the wall they'll very likely try the 1+2 escape throw which sends you
  on the wall.
# they may try some series ended with low kicks...
# WS+2:2 JF, a lot... beware mid-throw guess up. 
# lot's of punches, elbows, etc... after she turns you with her b+2 nasty
  thingie, immediately duck and crouch away: ("old" D/F notation, because you
  are on the other side.). It should evade many things.

 == Lee Chaolan/Violet ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have much experience against this guy... I ask for support :) He's but
very well-balanced and can juggle you long, long around the arena... till the
K.O. Not nice. :P The 1,2,4 series is also not very nice, since all hits are
guaranteed if 1st connects... Yoshi also should have something like this. :P
He has a lot of guess-up and is in general a very strong character... and he
requires much skill to be played at higher level of play. The effort put in
him is worth it. :)
You can Sidestep to Lee's left his WS+3,3 and continuation.
Beware customs with d/f+1: it has advantage on block, his jab will hit you
earlier than yours.
Do NOT attack after his f,f+3!!!
Beware his b+3,3:4 Mist trap throw! As you see familiar animation, duck :)

Guarantees:
Lee: d/b+3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Lee: b+1,1,2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG, after b+1,1 they often enter 
                        Hitman stance, you can also try to u/f+3 them :)
Lee: 1,F+2,2<2 (blocked) - you have 1,2,1
Lee: f,f,N+3,4...(blocked) - any ending can be stopped by 1,2,1
Lee: FC,(u/b_u_u/f)+4 (blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Lee: d,d/b+4(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Lee: u/f+4(blocked) - you have 1,2,1 (Yoshi's knee also should have such a
                      small disadvantage >_<)
Lee: f,N, 3~4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Lee: D+4>4>4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG, but it rarely happens.

Often used techniques:
# Eeh... I don't have much experience against him... He'll often enter Hitman
  stance for sure, don't think he can't block low moves: in fact he can! And
  hey! You can Bad Breath him out of his stance, LOL. :)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Heihachi Mishima ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This old type actually still can fight? o_O ^_^ Heihachi is strong and quite
fast, loaded with some interesting stuff...
Advanced opponents won't lose any chance to reverse your attack if you're near
a wall, and finish you with d+1 punches. Especially if you have less energy
than Heihachi... also, be awared that your suicide and in general ALL your
unblockable attacks can be reversed by him, even Sword Sweep! (but in case of
Sweep, the drawback is very small, you lose about 10 points? )
His Deathfist is tricky because your "guarantee" depends on the blocking 
distance... You can have various things guaranteed, but if blocked far away,
you'd better simply try the approach, but CAUTIOUSLY! His 1+2 stunning move 
may come and f,f+2 guarantee after KD!
(the same with your SS game: 1+2 will beat you out of every movement upclose)
Learn to defend his hellsweeps, and after you block them, usually Sword Sweep
is good... but you can also try mid-low guess up game. 
As Heihachi ducks, beware: his WS+2 has awesome priority and on CH he has many
guaranteed juggles or combos afterwards. 
1,2,4 series can be sometimes annoying, anyway... watch it, sometimes Heihachi
may miss due to game bugs and you'll have some nice guaranteed stuff after it.
Also, his cancels in the middle of Executioner are very interesting.
Anticipate them well. Usually throw or d/b+1 comes after that SS cancel.
Moreover, his f,f+2 has awesome priority, ducks high moves... beware!
Afrer WS+2 your jab will hit him earlier, although it doesn't look so.
Solid type, and lots of fun to play against. It's "who's smarter" fight...
and remember: "You have to defeat Heihachi at any cost!" :P

Guarantees:
Heihachi: 1,2,4(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Heihachi: 1,1,2(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Heihachi: 1+2(blocked) - you have 1,2,1, in any series.
Heihachi: d/f+1,2(blocked) - anything! Even f,f+1+2! ^_^ Recommended f+2. ^_^
Heihachi: f+1>b+2,1(blocked) - anything! Even f,f+1+2! Recommended f+2. ^_^
Heihachi: f,N,d,d/f+1(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG (FAST!)
Heihachi: QCF+2(blocked) - depending on distance: u/f+3, f,f+4...or nothing :P
Heihachi: f,N,d,D/F+4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Heihachi: WS+4,4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG, or f,f+4...
Heihachi: f,N,d,D/F+3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG

Often used techniques:
# Expect Deathfist everytime you whiff a move
# d+1 to death near a wall, his d+1 is faster than Paul's and hits more often.
  Mash a techroll to escape this, sometimes you can, sometimes you'll be 
  trapped, especially in the corner... >_<
# They'll defend against Sword Sweep with their reversal
# Nice custom strings!
# Good Heihachis will use their WGF's and EWGF's, beware at the distance.
# Anticipate the Spinning Demon low sweeps... and don't rely too much on a 
  guarantee, because great Heihachi player could do a JF version.
# Don't rush blindly after blocking f,f+2 or Deathfist... fast keep-away may
  come, such as 1+2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Kazuya Mishima ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fast, strong, dangerous! He can beat the hell out of Yoshi in two juggles,
his wall game is deadly, his custom strings are good, he's quick and solid, 
and his moves are strong compared to yours. It's a killer in right hands, but 
fortunately: he has some disadvantages. ^_^
His low moves can be easily spotted if only you don't lose your cool. That's
all about it. Block high, and anticipate/parry/block/whatever :P low moves.
He has but one combined throw, f,f+1+2, it's often used after Wave Dashing.
As you get thrown by this, and you know your opponent is highly advanced, DO
NOT QUICK ROLL after it, or you'll get nailed on the guaranteed stunning kick.
Be cautious as you SideStep, Kazzy has a very strong anti-SS game. His EWGF
will hit you while doing any SS move if you don't time them right. 
Beware near the wall, because Kaz is ultra strong here... you must be the one
to use walls for your own profits. :)
4~3 can be used from time to time, Kazyua seems to fall prey to this most
often. Of course: BEWARE!
Don't get smashed by his custom strings, he has the very fast ones, he has a
plenty of options available... remember to parry or block 1,2,4, beware of
b+1, be careful as he does 1,1, because a throw may come... You can out-poke
him with your jabs or d/b+1, Kazzy doesn't have any parry, he's a highly 
offensive character. Also, don't attack after f+4, you suffer disadvantage.
Anticipate his Wave Dashes by your simple d/b+1, flash or u/b+4. Use Bad
Breath a lot to keep him away or even to score a juggle as he tries EWGF. 
You can steal his moves, most desired is of course EWGF. :) Try to make some
juggles with it. :P

Guarantees:
Kazuya: WS+2(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Kazuya: 1,2,4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Kazuya: 1,1,2(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Kazuya: 1,2,2(blocked) - you have 1,2,1
Kazuya: f,N,d,d/f+1(blocked) - immediately juggle with 1,~f~f+3,3 Guaranteed
                               no matter the ending.
Kazuya: WS+4,4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Kazuya: d/f+4,4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG or f+4,4, depending on distance
Kazuya: f,N,d,d/f+4,4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG

Often used techniques:
# do NOT attack after being hit by d/b+4! The gut punch may come.
# Strong game in all distances... do your best!
# Don't stand up with any kick, it's too much dangerous. :)
# Don't use moves under which Kazuya can duck... ouch!
# Be careful with FC,d/f+3, if you have it blocked... OUCH!
# Stop his Wave Dashing by flash or d/b+1 punch, or u/b+4 kick away...
# Do NOT quickroll after their f,f+1+2 throw if you think somebody is advanced
# Remember that your jabs actually are faster than his!!!
# beware while SideStepping: Kazzy has a very strong anti-SS game.

 == Lei Wulong ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have much experience against this guy... I ask for support :)
Well...
He has stances, a wide amount of throws, very good custom strings, etc... 
As he turns his back to you, expect fast low punch: very often used, and its
range is great. Anyway, after you block some of his punches, a mid JGstarter
may come... Lei also loves his hopkick :) be awared. 
You can stop any stance switch after his Razor Rush punches by hitting d/b+1.
And anyway... interesting character. But I haven't played him for a long time.

Guarantees:
Lei: d/b+4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Lei: BT 2(blocked) - you have 1,2,1
etc... heh, too lazy to find more, sorry :) More in next version of this FAQ

Often used techniques:
# Well, Lei is the king of Mix-up, he'll use all what he has. At least good 
  Lei... well, don't underestimate him.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Bryan Fury ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have much experience against this guy... I ask for support :)
But...well...
He kicks ass near the wall, so beware. His custom strings are good, but well,
I haven't played many good Bryans... Beware his punch parry. :) Bryans often
use f,f+2 Mach punch, try to predict when it's coming and Bad Breath it.
They often use d/f+3 low juggling kick, especially after high punches...
Well: do your best. :) 

Guarantees:
Bryan: d/b+3(blocked) - you have WS+4
Bryan: d/f+3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG (FAST!... and upclose)
Bryan: SS+1~(2)(blocked) - you have 1,2,1 (both... just watch it close!)
Bryan: d+1+2(blocked) - you have d/f+4
Bryan: WS_QCF+1(blocked) - you have d/f+4 or d/f+2 + JG, just watch the
                           distance. :)
Bryan: QCB,2(blocked) - you have d/f+4
Bryan: f+4,3,4(blocked) - you have d/f+4
etc.

Often used techniques:
# Eeeh... can't remember. :) Waiting for support! ^_^
# OK... maybe u/f+4 kick to safe low punch and custom string...
# They often try to connect their low sweep after tricking you into high jabs.
# Mach punch often used...
# BEWARE NEAR WALLS! That freaking taunt is incredible...
# f,f+4 him out of his slower moves, like b,b+1...? ^_^
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Kuma/Panda ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Teddy bear is in fact dangerous! I bet that every player playing Kuma 
will hunt for f,f+2~ JF Low Salmon Hunter Unblockable. It's absolutely 
killing! All what you can do is desperately hold "B" while in the air and 
pray your opponent did the Salmon Hunter one frame too late. :P It's in fact 
the only what you can do... not to mention if you have a wall behind, 70% of 
your lifebar is gone for sure. Huh... also, backroll reduces the damage from 
120 points to about 80, it counts. :) 
What else? Well, Kuma is all about hunting for this action, with addition of
her Hunting stance (low moves are easy to spot), and far ranging jabs to keep
you away... use Bad Breath a lot and SS with caution not to be hit with f,f+2.
Also, it's good to attack with d/f+4 after his d/f+1 or d/f+2 single uppercuts
because he has much disadvantage here. He can only block.

Guarantees:
Kuma: WS+1(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG, no matter he tries ~2 or not
Kuma: FC,d/f+1,2,1(blocked) - you can d/b+1 him between 1st and 2nd hit
Kuma: FC,1,1,1,2,d+1(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG (and similarly after any
                                series ended with this low punch
Kuma: 1+2,1+2(blocked) - you have f+4,4, or f+3. After f+2 little guarantees,
                         you must be close to do b+1, throw.
Kuma: WS+1+2,1+2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Kuma: f+1+2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Kuma: b+3+4(blocked) - you can try suicide after it! Many times hits!
Kuma: Sit-punches(blocked) - you have u/f+3+4,1+2,1+2 pretty much guaranteed
Kuma: Hunting, 2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG

Often (ab)used techniques: :)
# Graah! f,f+2, Salmon Hunter JF: you'll have nightmares about it at night :P
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Eddy Gordo/Christie Monteiro ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overpowered, that's my opinion. Her/his juggles are very strong, he has 
just great mid-low game and custom strings, his attacks have great priority...
Yeah, he can easily win matches using only a couple of moves. :) But real,
"dancing" Eddy is very suprising and damaging. He'll trick you to attack and
then score one of his many damaging juggles, which eat a half of your energy
bar! You can't do much as he lies on the ground, upclose it's too risky due
to his fast jugglestarting series from this stance. You can back up and try
a Deathcopter :) hehe... Try to see and block/parry his low kicks: they're
strange... fast and long-ranging... well, you'll have to anticipate them,
you have no choice. And don't attack as he does his elbow attack, you suffer
a big stun. :)

Guarantees:
Eddy: 1+2~3(blocked) - you have f,f+2 (shorten distance)
Eddy: FC+1+2~1>2(blocked) - f,f+1+4 SUICIDE GUARANTEED!!!
Eddy: f+2,1,4(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Eddy: QCF+3(blocked) - you have d/f+4; or 1,2,1; or 4,4
Eddy: b+3>f(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Eddy: u/f+3~3(blocked) - you have f,f+2
Eddy: d/b+3~3(blocked) - you have f+2~d/f+2 + JG
Eddy: d/f+3+4(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Eddy: 3~4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Eddy: 4~3(blocked) - you have f,f+2 (sometimes hits on CH if followed with 3)
Eddy: d/f+3+4(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
etc, etc... it's easy to see disadvantages in his stances.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Steve Fox ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have much experience against this guy... I ask for support :)
Anyway...
Learn to anticipate his low punches, and you should be fine. :) You can then
wait for occasion to attack him... because he's really dangerous. His punches
are fast, have great priority and track your SideStep, you'll have to time
your SS moves right not to have them countered. If you feel that there's no 
way to stop his punches: Flash, and even steal something :P He has little 
disadvantages, and a lot of staggers. He's pretty much overpowered. :) 
Wish all characters had such a power... only some of them actually have...

Guarantees:
Steve: d/b+2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG (FAST!)
Steve: 1,2,1,d+2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG (FAST!)
Steve: 2,1,d+2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Steve: 1+2, 1,1,1,2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
...
and that's pretty much ALL!!! O_O >_< Overpowered !!!

Often used techniques:
# block and see his low punches: and you should be fine. Flash from time to
  time if you get bored with quick jabs. (thanks for Maddon for reminding
  me this... well, I don't play VS Steve too often :P)

MaDDoN's strategies against Steve (thanks!!!)

"VS STEVE FOX
When I play against Steve I play a strictly turtling game and rely very much 
on the flash. My brother plays Steve alot and when he starts with his evil 
mix-ups it's extremely hard to get out of them (guard stagger, turns you to 
the side on block, stuns and so on). It is also very hard to bulldogg Steve 
so I normally don't. Steve also has some low start mix-ups that start with 
d+2,1, and he has the cheesy 1,2,1,d+2 which hits low on the last hit. I 
find it easy to block both of these lows on reaction and therefore I usually 
just active block when he's throwing punches at me. Ducking, sidestepping 
and even duckjabbing can be extremely dangerous against Steve. I flash him 
almost as much as possible and everytime i expect the d/f+1+2 which is 
extremely fast and damaging, I then throw some punches/kicks (d/f+4) to buy 
some time before unleashing the stolen move (the d/f+1+2) back at him. I 
never play a distance game with Steve which i find to be very dangerous when 
beeing Yoshi. If I'm at a distance I simply let him get up in my face to 
throw punches at me. Be patient and simply block them all until you get an 
opening for the flash. Play boring and cheap. Let him use so many moves that 
he just don't know what more to do and then retaliate or flash him. If he 
gets in his flicker stance I never attack or duck or duckjab. Simply block 
and wait him out until he's finished, or flash and steal the flicker stance, 
or do nothing at all and wait until he get's out of flicker by himself. 
Attacking Steve when he's in flicker is asking for trouble. Going low can be 
successfull at times since many steves have a hard time blocking low. 
Everytime i see Steve ducking (not much) or swaying (more often) I do the 
Fubuki or the samurai knee to punish him.
My three main rules VS steve:
1: Active guard
2: Flash him
3: Don't duck"

I also find somewhat useful to try a throw after his d/f+1+2, use FC,d/f+3
at the distance for his Sways, do SS+1 wherever you see an opening (CAUTION!
He awesomely hits out of SS!) because it hits even his Sways.
Anyway, listen to Maddon! He plays VS Steve a lot. :)

 == Nina Williams ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have much experience against this girl... I ask for support :) 
Anyway...
she's dangerous upclose and also has a good game in the middle distance...
Watch her 1+4 cause she has a guess-up: throw (1+2 escape mostly) or 
guaranteed kick series (if first hits, of course :). Her custom strings are 
extremely fast. Beware the crouch dash, try to see what's coming. She can do 
both a MID move or her multithrow starter. Anyway, her low moves are easy to
spot, you but have to get used to them :).
But I haven't played any very good Nina, unfortunately.

Guarantees:
Nina: b+1(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG 
Nina: SS+1~F,3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG

 == Craig Marduk ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strong and really BIG guy, nasty type... he can be dangerous in right hands,
he has many interesting juggling moves, a JUGGLING throw, and these hated,
nasty tackles... the escape from his tackle is 1+2. It's a justframe, hit it
AS SOON AS you hear a cracking sound of Marduk's body impact.
Also, don't escape by throw command because experienced Marduks will feast
you with a reversal. Watch his hands: As he rises right hand: tap left punch
button. As he rises left hand: tap right punch button. You can do your best
by fixing your eyes somewhere near his head: as you see a left or right elbow
raised there, tap the indicated button. :)
Anyway, you can try d/b+1 or simple jump as you see Marduk charging at you 
with his tackle... (do stun kick after jump, yeah :)
The throw he may use is most likely the juggling one, escape with 1+2.
Use a lot of f,f+4 here, and fight in medium/to upclose distance... manily
upclose, because Marduk is strong in the medium distance, too.

Guaranntees:
Marduk: WS+3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Marduk: d/b+4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Marduk: 1,2,3,1+2(blocked) - you can u/f+3 him between 3 and 1+2, or punish
                             1+2 with 1,2,1
Marduk: d/f+1(blocked) - you have 1,2,1, or d/f+4, or 4,4
Marduk: f+1+2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 or f+4,4, watch the distance!!!
Marduk: d+1+2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Marduk: d/b+1+2(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG, backhand doesn't hit well.
Marduk: d/f+3,1+2(blocked) - you can u/f+3 him between 3 and 1+2, or punish
                             1+2 with 1,2,1
Marduk: f,f+3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Marduk: b+4(blocked) - many things, none of them hit well... try to duck it,
                       or f+4,4, or d/f+2 and spontaneous juggle
Marduk: FC,d/f+4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG

Often used techniques:
# Expect a tackle everytime you get up from the ground. Try a d/b+1 or...
  jump! ^_^ (and land with a stunning kick, hehe!)
# Often used are high strings mixed with d+1+2 which will duck under any of
  you jab attempts and juggle... learn it, block, juggle by yourself :P
# Stand up immediately after any KD, a powerful ground-hitting follow-up
  usually comes... it's better to be kicked with a low kick than by this 
  massive move... anyway, they soon may become predictable with these low
  kicks... :) and off course, always be ready that a tackle may come.
# If Marduk tries any throw, it will be 80% that juggling one, beware. Later
  on he'll try a mix-up...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == King ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have much experience against King, but in fact he's a very solid and
strong character. Don't even think of upclose fighting, he has a wide amount
of damaging throws, and also great poking abilities. At the medium distance he
is also very dangerous, his kick attacks have great priority. Beware if you
get a guard break due to his elbows, a damaging throw may come... but also
King's hopkick and juggle. Don't rely on kick attacks too much, because a good
King player will reverse them... and they can't be chickened. 
Most of players don't have respect for Yoshi, so teach him a lesson. You have
to have a good start to beat him completely and make him lose all his 
strategy... it's not only against King, but against all characters in general.
"We gonna fight for our right" - as one song says. :)
Also: check his throw breaks and multis... it's very important.

Guarantees:
King: b+1(blocked) - you have 1,2,1
King: f,f+1(blocked) - you have d/f+4 or 4,4
King: 1+2,1(blocked) - you have 4,4
King: f,N,d,d/f+1+2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG, DON'T misrecognize with
                               the f,N,d,d/f,f+1+2 version!
King: WS+2 and FC,d/f+2(blocked) - you have d/f+4, or 4,4, or 1,2,1
King: f,f+2(blocked) - you have d/f+4, or 4,4, or 1,2,1
King: f,f,N,2(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG

King: f,f+4(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
King: d+3+4,any follow-up(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG

Often used techniques:
# Jab to throw, especially that highly damaging one... ( f,b,HCF+1? ). Anyway,
  if you happen to fall prey to this, MASH a quickroll! ^_^
# Elbows, poking strings, interrupters... a real challenge. Do your best!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Marshall Law ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, the Bruce Lee-like character is now very powerful! I even like him, he's
very well balanced, has effective juggles and nice guarantees... his gameplay
upclose is what you should fear, he has awesome custom strings and also high
priority jabs. Beware his punch parry because it can hurt you very much. :)
The 1,2,3 series is abused by most of the players since they have little
disadvantage after it, and can follow it up with some nasty tricks. You can
try a low punch for 1,2,3-happy players that are NOT advanced... if they are,
they'll parry you for sure, or just SS and hopkick you for more damage. It's
all about a guess-up. Be smart! You can always delay a jab/punch or SS by 
yourself and u/f+3 Law for some juggle damage. At the distance sometimes 
you'll be able to duck the initial jabs and jab Law before the knee comes off,
also you can flash after the knee to stop all possible follow-ups. Not to
mention you can steal this series, lots of fun! ^_^

Guarantees:
Law: b+1,2,1(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Law: b+2,3,4 - parry the second kick!
Law: d+2,3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Law: SS+2,1,2>1(blocked) - you have even f,f+1+2! I recommend dash in and f+2
Law: 3>4(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Law: d/f+3(blocked) - you have f+4,4
Law: FC+3,4(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Law: d+3+4(blocked) - you have f+2, b+1, 2+4 (time it right!)
Law: FC, U/F+4(blocked) - you have 4,4, or d/f+4 
Law: d/f+4,3(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Law: d/b+4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Law: f,f+4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Law: (d+1+2),2~1(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG

Often used techniques:
# Parries of all description: use a lot of fakes, don't be predictable...
# 1,2,3 to either another 1,2,3 or d/b+1, SS~hopkick... anything! Beware...
# high punches to massive low sweep, much suprising... try to see it.
# They'll try to trick you into using jabs and then parry them: be smarter
  and use one of your unblockables... or u/f+3 / f,f+4. ^_^ Your knees can't
  be parried by him :)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Fan Hwoarang ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fan is his name, LOL. I'm not a fan of Hwoarang :) Anyway, this character is
amazing if in right hands, and can custom string you to death in a couple of
seconds... not to mention around arena juggles, mid-low guess up, fast juggle
launchers and plenty of set-ups to finish you in a couple of juggles :) Just
two syllables: RES-PECT! ^_^ It's the right word. Don't give him any chance to
controll the game, or you'll quickly lose.
Duck quickly 2nd hit of d+3,4 and d+4,4, best choice is Bad Breath.
Don't attack after f,f+3

Guarantees:
Hwo: f,N,d,d/f+3~3(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Hwo: f,N,d,d/f+4(blocked) - you have 4,4
Hwo: d/f+3,4(blocked) - try d/f+4, hits on any move attempt
Hwo: u/b+4(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Hwo: b+3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Hwo: BT 4, that juggling one(blocked) - you have d/f+4
Hwo: f,f+4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Hwo: 4,4,4,3(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG
Hwo: RFF 2,4,3(blocked) - you have d/f+2 + JG
Hwo: RFF f,f+4~3(blocked) - duck under second kick, u/f+3 + JG
Hwo: LFS d+4(blocked) - you have ... anything! ^_^
Hwo: RFS 4(blocked) - you have d/f+4
Hwo: RFS d+3(blocked) - you have ... anything! ^_^
Hwo: f,f+4(blocked) - you have u/f+3 + JG

Often used technigues:
# Well, I don't have much experience against Hwo... he'll try to use his 
stagger kicks to turn you to the side and launch in the air. You can press 
b+3 to do a BT kick which will hit him if he tries any move... anyway, these
kicks can be ducked under. Just try to be familiar with the animation and
Bad Breath them :)
# Awesome custom strings... watch all these low kicks! Learn his high kicks 
to quickly duck under them and do WS+1 +follow-ups
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Combot :) ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a random character, a mechanical Mokujin... you should recognize the 
character by the pre-fighting animation or the movement, eventually his arts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah... ther's a lot to add to the next version of this FAQ... There's a 
tournament to be held at the end of February, I hope I'll bring some fresh VS
Characters stuff. :) Also, I ask you for support! ^_^ Let's make our life be
easier. :) My e-mail is at the beginning of this FAQ: you're welcome!

==============================================================================
= [9] :: Finally... ::
==============================================================================

 == Mental Preparation ==

Playing Tekken is not all about techniques. Even if you master the game 
completely, but can't stand the pressure and lose your calmness in the battle,
you'll commit stupid mistakes, you won't see even most visible openings or
opponent's fakes and... you'll just lose. It often happens if you play in
a tournament. Yeah, the stress and pressure are great. :)
I prepared for you some nice quotations and words from experts of Fighting
Arts, and also I'll share with you my own experience and give you some 
useful pieces of advice. :) 

1. Concentrate on the nearest fight while waiting for yours
....you won't have time to become nervous. :P What for losing time in useless
"oh my!" thinking as you can learn something new from other fights? Myself, 
I anticipated many set-ups and fakes exactly because I watched my opponent's
previous fights. :)

2. "Overconfidence is your greatest enemy!"
Actually, these words belong to no one but Yoshimitsu! Just be modest. It
will surely help you maintain a calm and stable stance, will make you feel
comfortable, and won't allow you to uncover any of your techniques. There
are many players that love sniffing around, asking "Hey, do you use throws?
Who do you fear the most? How do you use walls?" etc, and they pretend to be
beginners... if you'll boast about your skills, not only you can accidently
reveal some of your strategies, but also it will put a shame on you as you
will lose. :) 

3. If you're a great Yoshi fan: Meditate. :P
Hah hah, I do not mean sitting on the floor and bouncing with a broom stick
or something. ^_^ Just try to focus. :) My favourite words I repeat in my
mind are Yoshi's "shiki soku ze kuu, kuu soku ze shiki...". But you can repeat
in your mind anything you want, even your favourite song or "Mickey Mouse is
great! Mickey Mouse is great!". LOL. ^_^ 
BTW, Yoshi repeats "namu, namu, namu..." to reach full concentration. :P
After some time you'll feel that fear vanishes out, and you'll be ready to
fight. :)

4. Eventually, warm up your fingers
...if you really don't know what to do with yourself. Also, it will surely
help you win. :P Especially if you want to make use of Meditation buffers.

5. Some nice quotations to think about. :)

"Victory is for the one
even before the combat
who has no thought of himself"
                   ~Shinkage Ryu adage

"Be shapeless, formless... Be like a water, my friend"
                   ~Bruce Lee

"What does Victory really mean? I would never have mastered taijutsu if 
I had clung to that concept."
                   ~Takamatsu Sensei

"First off, things ain't as hard as they seem. They are only as hard as we 
make them. Second lesson is that you have to learn to relax, 'cause when you
do, everything becomes easier'. And finally, number three, don't be so hard
on yourself. We all have good days and bad. Remember both but don't put too 
much weight to either. Just keep training and growing."

                   ~Joe Maurantonio [www.kihon.com], "Obstacle course"

"There is timing in everything. Timing in strategy cannot be mastered without
a great deal of practice. 
      Timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music, for they are
in rhythm only if timing is good. Timing and rhythm are also involved in 
the military arts, shooting bows and guns, and riding horses. In all skills
and ablilities there is timing. 
      There is no timing in the Void. 
There is timing in the whole life of the warrior, in his thriving and 
declining, in his harmony and discord. (...) All things entail rising and 
falling timing. You must be able to discern this. In strategy there are 
various timing considerations. From the outset you must know the applicable 
timing and the inapplicable timing, and from among the large and small things 
and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing, first seeing the 
distance timing and the background timing. This is the main thing in strategy.
It is especially important to know the background timing, otherwise your 
strategy will become uncertain. 
      You win battles with the timing in the Void born of the timing of 
cunning by knowing the enemies' timing, and thus using a timing which the 
enemy does not expect."

                   ~Miyamoto Musashi, "The Book of Five Rings (Earth)"

"In strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal. 
Both in fighting and in everyday life you should be determined though calm. 
Meet the situation without tenseness yet not recklessly, your spirit settled 
yet unbiased. Even when your spirit is calm do not let your body relax, and 
when your body is relaxed do not let your spirit slacken. Do not let your 
spirit be influenced by your body, or your body be influenced by your spirit. 
Be neither insufficiently spirited nor over spirited. An elevated spirit is 
weak and a low spirit is weak. Do not let the enemy see your spirit."

                   ~Miyamoto Musashi, "The Book of Five Rings (Water)"

"THE GAZE IN STRATEGY
The gaze should be large and broad. This is the twofold gaze "Perception 
and Sight". Perception is strong and sight is week. 
      In strategy it is important to see distant things as if they were 
close and to take a distanced view of close things. It is important in 
strategy to know the enemy's sword and not to be distracted by insignificant 
movements of his sword. You must study this. The gaze is the same for single 
combat and for large-scale strategy." 

                   ~Miyamoto Musashi, "The Book of Five Rings (Water)"

"In the Way of strategy as a warrior you must study fully other martial arts 
and not deviate even a little from the Way of the warrior. With your spirit 
settled, accumulate practise day by day, hour by hour. Polish the twofold 
spirit heart and mind, and sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight. 
When your spirit is not in the least clouded, when the clouds of bewilderment 
clear away, there is the true void. 
(...)
In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence, principle has 
existence, the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness."

                   ~Miyamoto Musashi, "The Book of Five Rings (Void)"

SWEET DREAMS & WISHES FOR NAMCO TEKKEN TEAM (for the upcoming new Tekken :P)

1. Old b+1+4: COME BACK! Or at least this version together with Soul Stealer!
2. f+2~D/B+2,2 and d/f+1,2~D/B+2,2 - come back the 5-spin version!
3. 30-point 3 roundhouse, please!
4. Return of the D/B+2,2,2,2,2,2 old damage rate! And B adv -4 each spin :P!
5. d/f+2 truly duck high moves! (better sway!)
6. Return old damage rate of all his moves!
7. Bad Breath: more extensions from Bad Stomach D/B+1+2! Please add the 
   possibility to enter FC mode after D/B+1+2!
8. Less disadvantage after blocked f,f+1+2! Any stagger, like in Soul Calibur?
9. f,f+2 to be safe move, let's say -8 disadvantage!
10. Return of the old f,f+4 properties and damage!
11. Do something better with QCF+2 throw!
12. Come back guarantees after throws!
13. Faster d/f+1,2 move! ^_^ 
14. Do something with standard jumping 3 kicks!
15. Better move coded as WS+1+2!
16. Do something with WS+3! It's the worst move!
17. Do something with d+3 kick! (like in SC 2) It's pretty much the same as
    WS~D/B+3! Don't you think?
18. Kangaroo Kick: fix the bug with turning around after juggling small chars!
19. Fix the bug with d+1+2 or even give Yoshi a better move instead of this
    =cough, cough!=, or at least give it better properties!
20. More guard breaks, anybody? :)
21. Why Eddy's u/f+4 is better than Yoshi's u/f+4? EXPLAIN!... please? ^_^
22. Make the Pogo Stance be more effective! Fix the bug after 3 or 4 Pogo SS,
    it would be better if Yoshi faced his opponent after this, no matter the
    previous position. :) Any Pogo Teleportation, please? :) Even if doing
    Pogo SS or duck, it's still very dangerous.
23. Make a u/f+3+4, b+1, d+3+4 (to Indian Sit) or u/f+3+4, b+1~b+3+4 (to 
    Evasive Sidespin) extension :) And in general more extensions! And do 
    something with Big Poison Wind, please, it's not guaranteed after
    anything!
24. Is the b,b+1~1+2 some kind of JOKE? :) Useless! Too much disadvanage!
25. Make the "Confusion" move duck high moves! (f,f, 1+4,n)
26. Make the FC,d/f+3 truly duck high moves!
27. BT recovery from Yoshi's spins, please? :) (e.g. B+1~u/b) 
28. Faster Indian Sit Levitation!
29. Why d/b+1 Smid punches hit Yoshi out of Flea? It looks unreal! It makes
    nearly all Yoshi flea guess-up game fail! It would be great if only
    high and some mid moves hit him from Flea...
30. Give Yoshi the ability to cancel his unblockable b,b+1!
31. Give Yoshi the roll forward like in SC! [ 4,4+K+B ] Make him more mobile!
32. Heyy? Where's the clean hit property? :) Why Yoshi doesn't score a clean
    hit frequently? Just compare with Paul or Xiaoyu!
33. Add the ability to enter FC position after Roo Kick! (Yoshi exits it...)
etc, etc... 

                             GIVE HIM MORE POWER!
If he's destined to be a character "for fun", he must actually kick ass, or
soon non-Yoshi-obsessed users will get frustrated and give him no chance...
As a character so much skill-oriented, it must be worth learning his skills...
Not like now, where a single d/f+2, f+3,3 is nearly as powerful as his 
spinning juggles! So what for taking effort? &%)&!!$%#*&&^! <-curses

Even now he's in fact a very solid character, but he should take more damage 
when fighting in the open area... without walls the damage he takes is weak...
and "Hello Namco!": everybody is great near walls!!! >_<

= [11] :: Info :) ::
==============================================================================

 == Yoshimitsu's Story ==

As the leader of the Manji Party, Yoshimitsu dedicated himself to providing 
food, medical assistance, and shelter to the ever-increasing number of 
political refugees around the world. Unfortunately, with a constant lack of 
necessary funding and manpower, Yoshimitsu was unsure about the future of his 
organization.When Yoshimitsu heard about The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, 
he envisioned a union between the Manji Party and the Mishima Zaibatsu. With 
this dream in mind, Yoshimitsu decides to enter the Tournament immediately. 
He must defeat Heihachi Mishima at any cost. 

(So...? No mercy for Heihachis! ^_^)

 == Yoshimitsu Bio ==

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Outfits ==

# 1 or 2 button [ left or right punch ] - Yoshimitsu in a bug-like outfit 
( my personal favourite in this Tekken ^_^ )
# 3 or 4 button [ left or right kick ] - Yoshimitsu: red haired demon-samurai
( nice hairdo... and armour in general! But I prefer wingy Yoshi! :) ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 == Pre-Fight/Winning Stances ==

Pre-fight stances are random... what the h***?! I want to CHOSE what Yoshi 
will do before the battle, Namco! I have some favourite animations! Groan!

#1.) Yoshi spins around and bumps on the ground with his... end :), 
dissappears and appears again, ready to fight.
#2.) Yoshi exposes his sword in a Soul Stealer-like movement: GREAT! ^_^ And
a nice warm-up for him for sure... :)
#3.) Our beloved stealthy ninja does a reverse backflip and lands in front 
of the opponent, ready to fight. Nice! ^_^
#4.) Yoshi does a Sword Sweep-like move. Scary! Wish Yoshi had this move! :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fortunately, we can chose some of his winning stances. :) You can chose your
favourite stance by pressing a button during Replay. Well, you can't directly
chose two of his stances: these are random:

#1.) Random: [neutral controller]
 - famous Yoshi dance! Yoshi hops on his right leg, laughs and poses in a 
funny way, saying "Gusha ittoku". :) I think it means "Even a fool can 
sometimes propose a good idea". :) What a sense of humour!
#2.) Random: [neutral controller] 
 - Yoshi waves his sword, does a backflip and sits on the ground, exposing 
his sword. He says "Jigou jitoku", which means: "You deserved what you got",
"You now pay for your mistakes", "You asked for it". :)
#3.) Press 1 [left punch]
 - Yoshi moves his hand along exposed sword and says: "Jigajisan!" Highly 
taunting, it means "self-praise". :) Naughty! ^_^
#4.) Press 2 [right punch]
 - Yoshi salutes with his sword just as he did in his Tekken Tag ending. 
I can't hear what he says, I think it's "Ansha horin... sho-jinsei!", but 
it's only my supposition. NAMCO!!! Write subtitles in next Tekken, PLEASE!!! 
Anyway, it's a very polite winning stance, Yoshi honoures his opponent.
#5.) Press 3 [left kick]
 - Yoshi Waves his sword back and forth [ very elegantly! :) ], stands still 
and poses. He says "shiki soku ze kuu, saraba!" [ meaning: "The form is 
itself emptiness, goodbye" ]. It's a part of great buddhist Heart Sutra... 
it's a philosophical thought, go to Yoshimitsu Obsession Team to read a whole 
paragraph about it. :)
#6.) Press 4 [right kick] 
 - Yoshi does double somersault, lands and poses with his sword, saying 
something like "rakuchi seikon"... but I'm not sure here, so I won't 
translate things that may be wrong... SOMEBODY HELP! heh heh... or maybe 
even the Japanese can't understand a word of this? :)

invite there all Yoshi fans, and especially you! It's because not me but YOU 
in fact keep this site alive with your appreciation, strategies and even 
criticism. :) YOT is for you, not for me, although I keep this site up.
Why it's the greatest Yoshimitsu Shrine?
I didn't think up this title by myself, this is what I heard from our visi-

 - YOT co-webmaster, for great dedication and help in updates :) Geez, if
   not you, there wouldn't be so many visitors watching YOT's development!
   Also, being a fan of Japanese culture, Kiri helped me with translations
   of Yoshi's words, and now he's our second multimedia provider, and also
   a very talented CG artist. :)

Agnieszka Blaszczyk: 
 - my best friend... whazzup?! ^_^ I miss french fries!  
   Biology Studies RULE! Hey, I think I will buy these Nereis parapodia... :P
   [ she will know what I mean... what? You don't know?! ^_^ @_@ Heyyyy! :P ]

Qoora, Grey-FoX, Odin, Taisho, Qba, Naimad, Griever, Saturn ...
 - and a whole Tej-City Team for exciting nights spent on hard-core 
   Tekken 4 sparrings :) Thanks to them I made so detailed anti- Paul, Jin,
   Heihachi and Julia strategies... and also a "vs-turtle-player" strategies. 
   Heh heh heh... ^_^ (If they read this, I'm gone! :P)

Maddon:
 - For his great "Yoshimitsu - THE COPYCAT" FAQ! ^_^ Good work! And for 
   very nice e-mail correspondence and experience exchange. :) Heh heh,
   we will never stop our efforts to master Yoshi, don't you think? :)

Tragic:
 - For greatest ever "The Yoshimitsu Manual FAQ"! I have great respect for
   your knowledge. It is my favourite Yoshimitsu FAQ, I still like reading
   it from time to time. :)

Namco & Tekken Team: 
 - for creating Yoshimitsu... but I would be really happy if you make some
   subtitles in Tekken 5! I can't decypher Yoshi's words! In SC2 there are
   kanjis listed, why not in next tekken? :)

My computer: 
 - it didn't break down, being so much exploited during the process of making 
this FAQ :P OK, maybe it broke down only once! :P

All Yoshimitsu fans:
 - who were with him when everybody shot him down and gave him no chance...

                       == The legend will never die! ==
                             YOSHIMITSU FOREVER!!!
