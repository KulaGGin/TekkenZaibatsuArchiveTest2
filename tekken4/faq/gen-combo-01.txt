     XXXXXXXXXXXX
I).- INTRODUCTION
     XXXXXXXXXXXX

¡Welcome to the Ironfist Tournament 4!. I think that the first objective in any 
game is to beat all your opponents and hence defeat the “final boss” (whom by 
the way in t4 is Heihachi). Ok, your vision is clear but your mission can vary 
depending of HOW you may to accomplish your final objective. In resume, you can 
do it the “hard way” (winning your opponents with fancy/new movements) or you 
can do it the “easy way” (by using the FAQ that you are reading this precisely 
moment). 

I mean “easy” because if you accomplish the movements that are presented here,
 your opponent will tend you say some words like this: “¡you’re so cheap!”, 
“that is not fair! (allowed)” or simple “damn you fu***”. This will turn 
especially true to those Tekken players that tend to Tech-roll (hit any button as 
soon as they touch the floor after being attacked) as soon as they get hit with 
a Juggle Starter (JG). 

In the overall, in this FAQ you will find the following staff:

*  How to beat the CPU with the best Time Killing Record at your local 
Tekken4 arcade center (you will “immortalize” your initials at the game’s 
Credits Name), as well as the usage of these techniques with some human 
opponents.

*  New movements attached to T4 as well as their usage in your new game 
strategy plan. Note I didn’t copy ALL the movements because I am sure that you 
already have an excellent printed version of the characters movements.

Now, ¡it’s time to kick some bad asses!.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


      XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
II).- BUTTON CONVENTIONS
      XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

I’ve borrowed this Tekken convention from the Zaibatsu folks. Please note that 
these movements are assuming that your character is FACING TO THE RIGHT.
(If they are facing to the left, reverse all b, f, B, F, SSL, and SSR 
commands).

///////////////////////////////
KILLING JUGGLES (KJ) TECHNIQUES 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

What does “Killing Juggles” means?. Is it some kind of new movement invented 
exclusively for Tekken4?. The answer my friends is: NO. It’s just a fancy name 
that I have decided to include in the Tekken gallery properties because it has 
attributes in order to drain a lot of energy from your opponent. If you read my 
previous FAQ´s for T3 and Tekken Tag Tournament you will be able to recognize 
the following explanation; and as we are talking now about Tekken FOUR, we will 
add another Step to the sequence in order to perform 1-2-3-4 steps for the 
Killing Juggle:


STEP-1) POSITION: As the name tells itself, it means the stance position you 
have to be in order to begin the KG. For example, if you read in S-1 that you 
have to be in the “Crouching Position” at the beginning of the round, hence you 
have to be full duck (D/B). In other cases you may not required to being in an 
specific stance, buy anyway its important that you have some critical distance 
between you and your enemy.


STEP-2) KILLING JUGGLE (KJ) STARTER: In this title, I present you the kind of 
attack that you have to perform against you opponent. This movement has changed 
drastically since other Tekken versions. Why? Because in Tekken 4 some of these 
fatal juggle starters have changed for some guys e.g. Kazuya´s WGF attack not 
only now it can be ducked but also it doesn’t have the attribute of float your 
enemy at the air with his (her) facing down to the floor in the air (remember my 
previous FAQ which detailed how Kazuya tend to rip off his enemy’s energy).


STEP-3) JABS: Now it’s time to lure your enemy, so you can “heat” its 
expectations that you are going to continue the Juggle Started with a combo 
meanwhile your opponent is defenseless in the middle of the air. Be sure to do 
this attack no matter how simple it can look up (most of the times it will be a 
pair of jabs), because the difference from Tekken Tag Tournament is that ¡the 
CPU won’t Techroll automatically after being juggled!,.


STEP-4) FINISHING: This means literally what its written ¡Finish your opponent!. 
How?, the answer is simpler ¡execute your enemy with an Unblockable movement!. 
Notice that T4 has introduced smarter CPU´s in order to avoid the KG´s but for 
some characters, these “bugs” (as one of the Namco dudes said in an interview) 
works perfectly in Tekken4.

Confused?. Don’t worry, and will explain in specific detail what these 1-2-3-4 
Steps involve and how you can use them in your game’s benefit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       XXXXXXXXXXXX
III).- PAUL PHOENIX
       XXXXXXXXXXXX

He is the first character in this FAQ because Paul was the source of my 
inspiration to continue my “nutjob” (since T3 and TTT), after I played Tekken4 
with the Phoenix and prove that some techniques of my Fast Time Killing Records 
STILL work in this newest version of Namco’s King of Ironfist Tournament. Why 
these “BUGS” weren’t removed in T4, well I have a couple of theories in mind 
that you will be able to read in a special section of this paper.

Yeah boys and girls, Paul is back in T4 and a good Tekken tradition ¡he is the 
easiest player to start with!. I mean this based in two considerations: first 
the game play of the King of Ironfist 4 demands that you have a reliable level 
on managing the diagonals of your control. Lets remember that in Tekken Tag, 
NAMCO first attempt to include the blocking down attacks (d/b) has an important 
significance in terms to just don’t pull the joystick all the time (technique 
sometimes called “turtle stance”). 


///////////
KJ for PAUL
\\\\\\\\\\\

Well, now it have became fundamental that you are a master in the crouching 
diagonals (d/b_D/B) in order to avoid the low starting juggle start attack. So 
remember Paul’s bitching kicking technique?. Yes, the infamous Falling Leaf 
(d+4,2) combo attack comes back very useful again. The difference? You have to 
be very close to your opponent to execute this movement, so the Elbow attack 
becomes guaranteed. 

Anyway, if you remember the Time Killing Records that I wrote for the Tekken3 
and Tekken Tag versions I have good news for all you that wants to become 
immortalize in the Time Records credits: ¡Paul still has some moves to kick ass 
the CPU in Tekken4!. 

Are you ready in toned-down the actually ridiculous record minutes?. Well, as a 
fan fanatic of oldie Paul these secrets are revealed now:


STEP-1)POSITION: One of the obvious differences in Tekken 4 is that before you 
start a round  you can move freely in the screen but without any attack button.
Anyway, here is the trick: before the referee yields “Round X … fight” you must 
be in  the CROUCH  DOWN position (D/B). This means that you really must excel 
your  diagonal  technique if you want to survive in the world of T4.


STEP-2) KILLING JUGGLE (KJ) STARTER: Now that you are crouching down, you must 
be really fast at the  beginning of  the round to execute the Thunder Palm 
(WS+2), so recommend that  you move far  away before the match begins from the 
CPU. This attack Juggles you  adversary  into the air and the most important 
property of this is that you opponent floats in a Facing Down position. 


STEP-3) JABS: Now it’s time to hit some jabs to your floating opponent (1_2). I 
don’t recommend you hit too much to your adversary because this course of action 
will tend to distance both characters, and believe me that this will work au 
contraire to you (for example, I kwon some guys that after their enemy has being 
juggle started, they tend to make automatically 3 or 4 jabs and the –for the 
worst- the hit ´em  with a Deathfist. ¡Ridiculous for our purposes!.
	

STEP-4) FINISHING: It’s time the moment of true, but with Paul this is the 
easiest part. After S-3 you just have to execute your enemy with the Unblockable 
hit (b+1+2).  The name of this movement is called “Burning Death Fist” and in 
this new version  of Tekken is still an insanely powerful attack. If you have 
perform successfully  Steps one trough four the last think you will have to do 
is take the last  remains of energy left from your opponent. In the particular 
case, Paul’s  opponent will fly away (very away) from you, so to finish him 
(her) once for all  you just have to run (f,f) and the sway (4) or jump towards 
your “about to die” enemy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

      XXXXXXXXXX
IV).- YOSHIMITSU
      XXXXXXXXXX

He is a “Bug” itself … ¡so what!. He is back and now ¡He’s more mysterious that 
ever!. The video showing Yoshi executing Paul’s Deathfist (QCF+2) opens and 
interesting perspective of Yoshi´s new beating Time Records. I will keep you 
informed about this strange movement in latest updates.


STEP-1) POSITION: And advantage of Yoshimitsu at the beginning of the round is 
that you can move backwards of your opponent simply by doing the Backflip 
(u/b~b). By doing this sway away you can keep an interesting distance from you 
and your opponent, specially when the CPU is obsessed to be nose-to-nose in 
front you. 


STEP-2) KILLING JUGGLE (KJ) STARTER: If you read my previous paper for TTT you 
might know what the move is about. Remember, in Tekken 4 there is just one 
special movement that can represent your victory from “GREAT!” or a sad but true 
“You loose”. This movement is of course the Shrine Lift (SS+2), why? Simply 
because when you connect this attack to your opponent they will get juggled just 
as you wanted to be: floating in the air and facing the ground. 


STEP-3) JABS: As we discussed previously, it’s imperative that you hit some jabs 
(1_1) to your flying and helpless opponent in order that the CPU automatically 
tech-rolls, so ¡do it!. One more thing, in T4 the inclusion of walls has made 
the game more interesting, the borders can be your friends or they can a hideous 
enemy in your strategy moves. So, for Yoshimitsu I recommend that you never try 
to do this movement closer to the wall edges because your enemy will suddenly 
tech-roll and be close to you to make any attack he (she) wants to. It’s vital 
that you start these KG techniques at a middle distance from the end of each 
stage, because Yoshi´s sword is very long.


STEP-4) FINISHING: Ok, you have your opponent surrounded next to the wall, so 
what now? ¡finish him!. Yes, the cherry at the top of this KG I to execute the 
Sword Impale (b,b+1), which will drain the 90% of damage to your furious 
opponent. Once again, you must notice in which stage you are fighting in, e.g. 
if you are at the “Fight Club” stage, then you must consider that in this Stage 
is really easy to get surrounded; but if what you want is space room, then the 
“Airport” stage is your best choice to move freely and make your sword shine in 
the sky.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     XXXXXXXXXXXX
V).- MARSHALL LAW
     XXXXXXXXXXXX

First at all, let me tell you that I am tired to repeat to the ignorant people 
that says “Yaahh, look at Forrest Law, he looks thinner and oldie…”. Once for 
all ¡it’s Forrest’s father and his name is MARSHALL!.

His arms may be shorter than his son, but once clear that point let move to the 
core of your attention, the “killing technique of Law”

Step-1) POSITION: As you may be aware, you can move any direction before the 
match begins (except that no button will work until you hear “fight”). So my 
recommendation is that you move backwards to avoid an annoying CPU that tries to 
get over you as quick as it can. Then move pull down backwards the joystick to 
stay in the ducking Stance (D/B).



Step-2) KILLING JUGGLE (KJ) STARTER: Law has quiet more opportunities to juggle 
his opponent is a convenient way than other character. Let me start with a 
similar KG Starter similar of his buddy Paul: use the Dragon Upper (WS+2) after 
S-1 and rumble your opponent to the sky. An inconvenient of this KG Starter is 
that it doesn’t place your enemy in the convenient “mid/air facing down 
position”, so you must not expect a 100% of effectiveness every time your 
perform this killing technique.

An alternative KG Starter to the mentioned above, is to use the Junkyard Combo 
(b+2,3,4). This attack represents of course a more difficulty to pull-off in 
order to hit your opponent, because it’s just the third move that interest us, 
Why? Simple because it contains the property that we were looking for: the 
opponent’s Facing Down Position. 



STEP-3) JABS: Now it’s time to make the CPU think that you are going to perform 
it serial attacks while its in the middle of the air floating. So, in stead of 
smashing your opponent, just hit one jab (1) or two jabs (1_2). Be careful of 
the distance you want to be with your opponent, if your are close to the wall 
you don’t want to connect 2 or more jabs. 





STEP-4) FINISHING: At last, it’s time to unleash Marshall big punch: the Dragon 
Fang (d/b+1+2).This Unblockable move is comparable as Paul Burning Death Fist 
because it almost leaves your enemy at a flat linear point. Depending of your 
choice in the Step-2 (S-2) your probabilities of connect this super hit to your 
opponent will vary. So the most probable it’s that it will be connect an air/mid 
Facing Down opponent. 

One more thing, I know that sometimes it's hard to do S-4 because it needs to 
press TWO buttons (1+2) at the same time making it a hard move to pull off 
properly for beginners, so listen, an important difference about Tekken and 
other games (like Street Fighter X-version) is that if you want to press more 
than one button at the same time. You can  just press one button then HOLD that 
button and press the other and so on; in  the previous example it means (1) –
hold it-, (2) -hold it-, (3) -hold it-,and  finally press (4). This can become 
very handful in many characters multimoves, and Heihachi its no exception: you 
may noticed that sometimes Step-3 means connecting a couple of Jabs (button 1), 
well ... which button you need for the next Unblockable move?, Yeah! The 
(d/b+1+2)!, so if the buttons seemed to be very whacked out simple Jab the 
floating opponent with Left Jabs (1_1) and HOLD the first button (1) and 
immediately finish the Unblockable Dragon Fang (d/b+2).It will work perfectly 
and without any whiff surprises!.

Well my friends, that's all for now ... but don't worry I will update this FAQ 
with other interesting characters like: Steve Fox, Jin Kazama, Heihachi Mishima 
and other interesting competitors.


About the last epilogue in Tekken Tag Tournament: 
WILL THE FOLKS OF NAMCO ELIMINATE THESE “BUGS” IN TEKKEN 4 ???

I have an answer for this million question: No. First at all, the techniques 
presented in this article cannot be considered as “bugs” because this words 
means “malfunction”. IF you have read carefully this text you may noticed that 
in certain occasions the CPU tends to wake up (tech-roll) as soon as it hits the 
floor ... ¡just as some nervous dudes I know!. Well, technically it can happened 
as a machine as an intelligent human being. 

But, for my satisfaction I can say that I KNOW that some people of NAMCO have 
read my last paper, How do I know? Simple because most of the Killing Juggle 
Techniques that worked beautifully in the previous Tekken series, now are gone 
for good and just a few remain intact. 

Anyway, I think that in Tekken Tag Tournament 2 (yes, TWO ... ¡just imagine the 
possibilities!), we’ll still discussing this issue. 


I would also like to salute some good friends of mine: my brother Franz and of 
course my Mom Gladys Martha for being so supportive all the time, my "compadre" 

Luchin (LFSG) with which we started to enjoy the Tekken games playing thousands 
and thousands of hours with the PSX at home; my "padawan" learner Jusseff and 
his family; and finally to all the Tekken Players here in La Paz (Vladi, Andres, 
Ariel, Felix, and all the guys at the Arcades) ... This one goes for you boys!
