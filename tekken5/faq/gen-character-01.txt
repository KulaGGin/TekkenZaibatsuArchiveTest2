Nine char faq by Freeman (Rokas Balciunas)
0.5 beta version
In future version - will be corrected mistakes,
some chars more in depth

	This faq is dedicated for all tekken players. Even masters
will find some interesting info. I am fanatic tekken player (5+ years
of playing) from Lithuania and i am responsible for all info in this
faq. If you are new to tekken you will find out which char is more
usefull for start and which char has good perspectives but hard to
learn. You must spent some time for practice if you want to win.
Tekken is all about psychological war amongst two players,antcipation
and movement plays pretty big role in this great game. Every move has
purposes in variuos circumbstances. Tekken is most complex fighting
game ever. There are seven types of attacks in Tekken.
	For defensive purposes  there are kick, punch reversals,
various parries, you can simply block an attack or evade it with
sidesteps.
	Advanced movement can add bonus to your playing style, can
serve to offence and defence also helps to mess your opponents mind.
E. g. high attack can be blocked standing, ducking and you won't
break guard with it - sounds pretty useless, but remember high
attacks commonly are the fastest strikes in the game. High hits can
be used in custom strings, you can counter majority slower moves and
your char recovers very fast. Very few tekken players can escape
throws on reaction, if you are beginner and don't know how to perform
juggles then go for a throw.
	Some chars have an attack reversal, it requires skill and
looks cool but you can be chickened out of it. Don't learn very hard
juggles because you can screew with them in high pressure matches.
I advice to use not more than two simple juggles from each starter.
Very hard, complex and cool looking juggles are mostly for show.
Walls play big role in almost every match. Some chars have lethal
wall juggles and if you know them and have skill, it will win lots of
matches.
	Okizeme (Oki) it's Japanese term that means - art of keeping
opponent on the ground. If you are new in tekken, master probably
will kill you with okizeme, if you are medicore tekken player then
you probably will lay down still and eat some hit then raising
safely.
	Tekken master is very hyphotetical and conceptual term. In my
opinion master plays Tekken many years and takes prize places in
global tournaments (such as Evo, National USA, South Korea and Europe
championships). His game-play is very flexible, he uses char in it's
full potencial, his juggles are impossible, okizeme devastating,
custom stringing lethal, "simple" pokes leads in huge damage, master
is cold blooded and forse you to pay for all your mistakes. Fight
between medicore tekken player and master reminds me laboratorical
rat vs scientist fight.

Basic conventions, which is used in many faq's, guides and forums
from all over the inernet. Without these terms you will not
understand many info about tekken. I suggest you to read theese first
then go to other parts of this faq.

1 - Right Punch
2 - Left Punch
3 - Left Kick
4 - Right Kick

First you have to separate tapping an holding. To tap you need just
fast press than emediatly release joystick. To hold you need to push
joystick during move execution.

f - tap forward once           d/f - tap down/forward once
b - tap backwards once         d/b - tap down/back once
d - tap down once              u/f - tap up/forward once
u - tap up once                u/b - tap up/back once


F - Hold stick forward    D/F - Hold stick down/forward
B - Hold stick back            D/B - Hold stick down/back
D - Hold stick down            U/F - Hold stick up/forward
U - Hold stick up              U/B - Hold stick up/back

N - Neutral joystick position (Joystick is not touched)

SS - Sidestep (u,N or d,N)
CD - Crouch dash f, N, d, df

QCF - Quarter circle forward (Circle stick from down to forward)
QCB - Quarter circle back (Circle stick from down to back)
HCF - Half circle forward (Circle stick from back to down to forward)
HCB - Half circle back (Circle stick from forward to down to back)
+ - Moves must be done together
, - Moves must be done right after the other
~ - Moves must be done IMMEDIATELY after the other
_ - Or (When used between two moves, they are interchangable)
>- Move following the > has the option of being slightly delayed
FC - Do move during full crouched position
Fast full crouch - D/B (Fastest way to go to FC possition)
WS - While standing up (Returning the stick to neutral from a crouch)
Instant while standing - db,N(Fastest way to do while standing moves)
RN - While running
BK - Back facing opponent

ADVANCED MOVEMENT
Movement plays big role in tournanment play. Alot of tekken players
use basic movement (sidesteps, forward dashess, backward dashes etc.
etc.). But to use advanced movement you need a lot of practice.
Though advanced movement seems to have larger payoff. Advanced
movement also called mind games serves for a different reasons:
a) for spacing
Creating usefull distance from your opponent, depends of
circumbstances (deffence, offence, evading purposes, your game style,
your character)
b) for creating usefull position for attacking mix'ups
c) to make your opponent afraid to attack
d) to do show (wave dash, light dash, snake dash, ha ha and
hayashida steps looks so cool)

Only downward with advanced movement is that some characters do not
have CD, Backsway and other options. Also in it isn't a rule that
characters with advanced movement is must for high level play, if you
are tekken master you probably win fights with chars without advanced
movement posibilitie.

WAVE DASH is performed:
f,N,d,d/f,f,f,N,d,d/f,f,f,N,d,d/f,f,f,N,d,df
You need to do 3-4 wave dash per second, if you perform wave dash
right - it moves you a lot faster than running. Character must have
CD option. From wave dash you can do a lot of lethal mix'ups such as
regular moves from CD, CD canceled into ws or forward dash moves.

LIGHT DASH is performed:
f,N,d,d/f,f,N,d,d/f,f,N,d,d/f,f,N,d,df,f
Light dash is quicker than wave dash, but it is very hard to do with
regular ps2 joystick.

CD and wave dash cancel into f,f moves:
f,N,d,d/f~f+forward dash comands
e. g.
f,N,d,d/f~f+1+2 - crouch dash canceled into stonehead (kazy,heihachi,
Dev Jin)

CD canceled into ws moves:
f,N,d,d/f~b+ws move (needs good timing)
f,N,d,d/f,F+ws move
f,N,d,df,~db+ws move (needs good timing)
e. g.
f,N,d,d/f~b+1,2
f,N,d,d/f~b+4,4
With kazuya you can mix'up hellsweep with twin pistons or tsunami
kicks.

Snakedash is performed:
f,N,d,d/f~f,SS,f,N,d,d/f~f,SS
f,N,d,df~SSUP,f,N,d,df~SSUP,f,N,d,df~SSUP
All two methods work, only movement angle is different.

(Chars with QCF option also can do snake dash: QCF~N,SS)

Hayashida step can perform characters with backsway option:
QCB,~SSU, QCB,~SSU,QCB,~SSU - basically it is backsway canceled into
sidestep up to 3-4 times per second, main purpose is to evade
opponents hits and depending of your char you can attack opponent
with QCB, SS or regular hit.

Ha, Ha step is performed with Lei:
b+3+4,~b,b+3+4,~b,b+3+4,~b
It is safer and faster to do ha, ha step than regular back dash with
Lei. There are alot of more commands to do ha,ha and he,he step,
though command written above you can parform much simpler and mess up
possibilitie is far lower.

RFF backstep performed with hwoarang:
b+3+4~b
I suggest to do it from medium distance, it is very unsafe to do it
from close range.

I will not write very large guides for each character it is just a
general info about each char perspectives. I wrote about pros, cons,
some my favorite juggles and short description of some usefull hits.
It is only my opinion, there are no useless hits, every hit and
movement in different circumbstances can be usefull. Don't do the
same hits over and over, because even most usefull moves done
repeatidly on Tekken Master will lead you to quick death. Tekken is
very complex game, it is all about psycholgy and unpredictibility.
Classical faq about tekken (T3) psychology is written by Catlord and
it is still can be very usefull, at least it will give deeper view on
Tekken. Also I wrote those juggles which are possible to pull at high
presure fights. Don't spend time to learn complex and hard to pull
juggles because if your opponent has psychological control over match
you probably will whiff or won't get chance to pull them. There are
variuos juggles in www.tekenzaibatsu.com, though some of those
juggles at high presure fights can perform only Masters.
There are frame data for all chars at tekkenzaibtsu site, detailed
faqs at www.gamefaqs.com and very detailed info in tekkenzaibatsu
forums about your favorite char.

DEVIL JIN
Basically it's t3 Jin. Classical T3 Jin faq which gave format for
future tekken faq's is written by Slikatel. His new the wrath of God
techniques is worthless against Master or expert type players. He
hasn't fathers ws+1,2; db+4; df+2 to play vs Steeven. Though if you
caught in your hands medicore opponent than you must show them
advantages of devil possesion.

Pros
Simple damaging juggles
Decent pokes
Good okizeme
Reversal capable
Wave dash, snake dash capable
Appearance looks cool

Cons
Weak wall juggles
Very hard against Steeve
Also limited arsenal of moves vs Hwoarang

Devil Jin tactics vs from beginner to average opponent. I will
describe some very damaging attack set'ups and interuptable points
of those attacks. Although those people who knows Dev Jins
interuptable points probably will be from expert to master level
players.

Fear the wrath of God

CD+1,UF - extended cool looking thunder god fist. Dev Jin grabs enemy
high in the air then provides painful landing. To set up this attack
you need to train your opponent to duck after Dev Jins crouch dash.
Easiest way to do that is to perform hellsweep (CD+4) from close
distance couple times with white heron juggle combo (1+4,2,4 easy
and damaging choice). If good opponent blocks thunder god fist he
will punish you with 1, 1, 1 variation juggles.

Electricity mode
Usually medicore opponent don't use much custom strings. So if you
don't see much pokes from opponent than it's time to do ewgf
(electric wind god fist) party ( ~f,N,~d,~df+2). If you have some
skill than do b,f+2,1,>(delayed)2,df+4,4 juggle.
Easier 1 b,f+2,1,2 juggle also works reliably after wgf or ewgf.
Ewgf is highly anticipating by masters and it is tonned down since
TTT.

Stun punch string b,f+2,1,[2_d+2]
If you land this combo on major counterhit it double over stuns after
second hit and it's good chance to do most damaging Devil Jins
attack. If df+1,2 connects and opponent tries to attack he probably
will eat CH b,f+2,1,d+2,1,b,f+2,1,2,
then go for oki attempt
(SSUp, delayed version of the f,f+1+2/f,N,d,DF+3 then CD+4/CD+3 - all
three methods works in various circumbstances) or simply do another
b,f+2,1,d+2,1,b,f+2,1,2 for impatient opponent.
Interuptable point in this combo is second hit, you must hold forward
to escape double over stun. Also you can counter with stun punch
string all alone without key attack from medium distance.

Flying attacks
Fly                          3+4, 1+2
Infernal Destruction
Fly                          3+4,  f+1+2
Cross Infernal Destruction

Good vs peoples which don't know that they have to sidestep to avoid
these attacks. Mutch more stylish option than  u/f+4,4,4,4 to rape
masher Eddie users witch uses stances from distance.

Sparkling corpse splitter variations [u/b_u_u/f]+2+4 is good to
punish opponent whitch is laying still.

If opponent hits wall after juggle don't do hard wall combos. If
enemy lies down still go for a df+1+2 laser shot downwards. If
opponent immediatly gets up it's best time to do unblockable Super
Spinning Godfist B+1+4. Master will watch what you are doing and
probably rolls to you to punish unblockable attempt.

Attack reversal b+1+3 or b+2+4 requires some skill. But what can be
more humiliating than to die from your own attack. Only do this if
you predict attack. Reversal is escapable with chicken.

REGULAR HITS

1,1,2 - shining fists
Mishima trademark hits. Can serve for many purposes. Good whiffed
attacks punisher at close distance. You can interupt attack with
them. You can nail opponent to wall and do easy attack to helpless
enemy (my choise is f,f+2). First two hits usefull for custom
strings. Don't try to finish last hit if first two hits are blocked.

1,2,4 - 1,2 knee
If you want quick attack that pushes opponent back and gives you
some space, this attack is right choice. If you connect this attack,
then go for some medium range hits. It is wise choise  to add this
attack in custom strings.

df+4,4/ws+4,4 - Tsunami Kick
Good whiffed attack punisher at medium distance. For poking purposes
use only first kick and then continue attacking as second kick has
frame disadvantge and you probably won't have sucsesful attack
possibility.

df+1,2 - twin lancers
Quick two middle punches which serves well in poke wars, you can
punish christie stances at close distance. Twin lancers can lead into
seriuos damage for your opponent, so if you connect them then
continue custom stringing.

f,f+2 - Demon Paw
Use it like Pauls deathfist. It is safe to do it at the end of wave
dash. Also you can punish power wall stunned opponent.

db+1 - quick sm punch
In Slikatels guide are many custom strings which starts with
df+1,2 d+1. Now d+1 is corpse thrust, so you must do db+1 to get old
d+1 punch. Interuptable point in df+1,2 db+1 is last hit, you can
interupt it with jumping attack (Ninas u+4, Pauls uf+3, Leis uf+4,
Jins d+3+4 etc. etc.)


f,N,d,d/f+3             LEAPING THRUSTKICK  (Juggles)
f,N,d,D/F+3             LEAPING LOW THRUSTKICK
Very good attacks from distance for Oki purposes.

f,N,d,D/F+4,4           Hell Sweep
Use only first hit. Against experts use it only for okizeme. Vs
medicore opponent do hell sweep from close distance and go for white
heron juggle.

d+4
Very annoying low attack. If you connect this hit often in custom
strings then it is big posibility that your opponent is angry.

Devil Jin is very weak in wall juggles. Personaly I do written below
juggle.
Wall juggle
1,2,4~1+4,2,4_(d+4)

I suggest you to do against experts wave dash with safe attacks.
Riskier
wave+ws+2
Safer
wave+f,f+2

If your enemy does not escape throws mix poke strings with throws.
Vs people which escape throws on reaction do d+4 attack.

Poke strings

1,2,4 d+4 f,F+1,1 d+4, ws+4, d+4

1,2,4 ewgf

df+1,2 1,2,4 d+4

df+1,2 db,N~ws+2

df+1,2 db+1, f,f+1+2

1,1 d+4, ws+4

1,1 df+1, df+1,2 d+4

1,2,4 f,F+1,1 df+1 d+4 ws+4,4

PAUL PXOENIX
This guy is very simple and brutal - mentaly and phisically. Paul is
good guy to lumber trees and brake walls, but he lacks flexibility,
finesse and hits variaty. If you are tekken beginer and for the start
you need some simple learned character - Paul is a good choise.
Simple performing high damage moves such as:
qcf+2;
d+1+2;
d+4,2;
d+1,4,2;
d+1,2
1,2;
uf+3,4;
1,4.
will kill mashers and unexpereanced tekken players and you will get
chance to resist some good players. But beware of tekken master.
Every tekken expert or master knows Paul very well and make you
suffer after few mistakes, in beginer hands Paul aigainst master is
just a punching bag.

Pros

Fast, high damage moves
Annoying hands
Easy to learn
Good evasive posibilities
Easy to kill masher christie
Usefull just frame attack
Simple wall game
Good tenstrings
Reversal capable
Hayashida, snake step posibility (see on advanced movement section)

Cons

Ultra predictable
Borring in beginer hands
Short movelist
Idiotic screaming
Some moves very risky

d+1+2 - Iron mountain
Hihg risk, high reward move. Useful in poke wars, to send opponent
into wall, to punish weird lei stances, good juggle ender after
uf+3,4. If good player will predict this move you are screewed,
because there are many guaranteed followups after blocked d+1+2.

qcf+2 - Death fist
Pauls visit card. Makes huge damage on counterhit, pushes far away on
block, if opponent is attached into wall and shrivelled you must to
deathfist them to end up their suffer.

d+4,2 - Falling leaf combo
Here's second annoying move after deathfist. Qcf near opponent then
pull this combo and your enemy will start to duck after qcf, it is
perfect setup for middle hitting hated deathfist. There are just
frame d+4,2,:1 and d+4,2,:1+2 but it is for experieced players.

d+1,4,2/d+1,2
Pull several times first option then setup for second part is
finished and opponent trained to duck.

d+1 - Tile splitter
Alone this move is suited to rape christie, xiaoyu low stances. If
you play against masher eddie than don't be shame to overuse this
move because eddie masher deserves it. Also it's reliable match ender
from longer distance.

db+1 - non official quick sm punch
Has weak follow'ups, sometimes useful in poke wars.

1,2 - one, two punches
Good option to presure oponent. Paul is good jabber but you need
followups after theese punches. 1,~4 and throws are good folowups,
also you can try d+1+2 if opponent wants to retaliate theese annoying
jabs.

b+1+3/b+2+4 - attack reversal
If opponent is predictable with attack you can try this. Requires
some skill but it surprizes beginners. Cool match ender. Remember
that reversal don't catches low hits, elbows, shoulders and knees.
If you try this in predictable manner against master you will find
out what the chicken is.

qcb+1 - Bounce Tile Splitter  (Bounces on CH)
Good range evasive hit. On ch it bounces and what you need is only
deathfist.

uf+3,4 - good interupter sm and low level hits such as Law's d+2,3;
Nina's d+1,~n4. Finish juggle with painfull d+1+2.

Juggles

uf+3,4,d+1+2
uf+3,1,2,uf+3,4
uf+3,f,F+1,f,F+1,f,F+1,~f,f+2,1

df+2,qcb+3,2,2
ws+2,1,uf+3,4
ws+2,1,qcb+3,2,2

KAZUYA MISHIMA
Classical mishima fighter. Electric wind godfist owner (ewgf). Has
alot of easy performed stunning moves. Not large movelist but hits
properties are very good.

Pros
High damage juggles
Good mix'ups
Lots of stunning moves
Wave dash & light dash, snake dash (see on advanced movement section)

Cons
Weak wall game
Poore movelist
Requires high skill  and tekken knowledge to play efectively

1,1,>2-Shining assault
Good attack ineterupter, poking tool and opponent will be knocked
down if last hit connects.

WS+1,2 - Twin Pistons  (Juggles)
Very good juggle starter. If first hit connects second is guaranteed.
When you predict lots of highs pull twin pistons after ducked high
hits and do painfull kazy juggle. Good to mix'up with hellsweep, you
need to cancel wave dash (advanced movement section).

f,N,d~d/f+2 - Electric Wind Godfist  (Juggles)
Mishimas trademark hit. Far better than regular wind god fist far
harder to pull it. Use it for counterhit purposes. Because it hits
high try to mix'up it with mid hitting moves (such as df+2). You can
pull very painfull juggles from it. Good wave dash ender on agressive
opponent.

f,N,d,d/f+2 - Wind Godfist  (Juggles)
Another mishima hit. If you are unexperienced with kazy than you
probably will do weaker version of wind god fist. Wgf+4 - is damaging
simple combo for beginners. Main purpose of CD - to duck and punish
high attacks.

f,N,d,df+4,1/4 - Hell sweep variations
Powerfull low hit. Don't get predictable with this because if it is
blocked you are in serious trouble. CD+4,1 - cool looking juggle ender.

d/b+4 - Low Slipkick
Annoying safe low attack. Has good range, good track and if it is
blocked it won't lead into very damaging follow'ups from opponent.
Good match ender.

1,2,4 - 1, 2 punches and low slip kick
Pull last hit only when first two hits connects. Most people will block
last hit and punish your attack.

f,f+2 - Demon cutter knife
If you opponent are predictable with ducking, pull this painfull
jugglestarter. Also has good range.

df+2 - Gut Punch (stuns on CH)
Kazuyas best stunning move. Fast middle strike to punish whiffed moves.
On Ch follow'up with wgf, ewgf, CD+4,1. Has far more damaging (with SS)
follow'ups but leave them to Tekken Masters.

ws+2 - Kazuya Gutpunch  (Stuns on Clean Hit)
Most damaging stunning move. Follow'up with ewgf/wgf juggles.

f+1+2,f+2 - Glorious Demon Fist, Soul Thrust
Sounds cool, stuns but comes out slow. Useful for okizeme. Try to pull
out it from distance.

f,f+1+2 - Stonehead
Mishimas best throw, which requires two hand escape. Could be pulled
out from canceled crouch dash or wave dash.

d/f+4>4 - Delayable Axe Kicks
Could be used and for defence and for offence and for punishing whiffed
moves.

Wave dash/Crouch dash canceled into ws+4 - cool looking match ender
(advanced movement section).

FENG WEI
The key to play with Feng - is not to be predictable. If good player
predicts your attack then you are screewed. Feng has some cool looking
thrusts which forces your opponent to fly back.

Pros
Good thruster
Easy to learn
Many stunning moves
Good mix'ups from qcf and sidestep
Good evading properties

Cons
Some moves very risky
Medicore damage perspectives
Weak wall jugles
Lacks hits vs sm pokes
WS moves aren't spectacular

f,f+2- Advancing Palm
Attack which covers long distance. Good for okizeme.

b+1- Palm Thrust
Very quick thrust vs high pokes. If opponent flies back - finish em
with b+1+2.

SS+4- Spinsweep
Low attack which juggles from close distance. Popular juggle - df+1
f+2,1 db+1+2,2 FC+3 (I use easier df+1 df+1 db+1+2,2 FC+3).

SS+1+2 - Steel Flower
Medium range mid strike from sidestep. I think enemy sees flowers after
this hit. Good to mix'up with SS+4.

df+1- Server Fist
Quick mid attack, though it won't leads in to guaranteed followups.

df+2,2 - Mid Palm, Advancing Palm
Good vs crouching opponent. Last hit pleasantly thrusts enemy.

db+1,2 - Swaying Fist, Blue Egg Fist
Reliably evades all high attacks and thrusts your enemy back. Use whole
string.

b+1+2 - Power Iron Shoulder
High risk high reward move. Use it on agresive opponent from distance
and pray that he won't block it. Also it could be used on power wall
stunned opponent (I use f,f+3).

db+3 - Low Sweep
Annoying quick low attack which covers some distance. If it is blocked
then expect retaliation, if it is not - go for WS+1,2>1 to run out from
danger.

qcf+1/qcf+2
Very deceptive attacks from qcf. Qcf+1 hits grounded.

1,2,2 - Advancing Fists
Personally I use 1,2 df+1+2/1,2,2 mix'up.

1,1 - Jab, Stomach Slug
Quick punch attack, good for Fengs game variaty.

db+1+2,2 -  Mid Punch, Low Pound  (Stuns on CH)
Evades high attacks (though db+1,2 is more reliable), stuns on CH and
could be used in juggles.

b+2>3,4,2 - Iron Series
Like all strings it is not good for your health if you overuse it.
Throw this very sparingly to finish fight.

b,f+1 - Falcon Beak (Stuns on CH)
Just like Pauls T-Elbow it evades many attacks and stuns on ch
(Pauls version doesn't stuns).

NINA WILLIAMS
Average and especially masher type players ussualy don't use Nina. Nina
has all tools to be lethal char. Her pokes, juggles, evasive properties
and wall game are serious threat for all tekken players. Get close to
the opponent anf find out what he got's. In my opinion poking is the
key to win with Nina. Multithrows are quick and damaging but them
somehow hard to land on experienced tekken player.

Pros
Poking massacre
Good juggles and wall juggles
Fast
Hayashida step capable

Cons
Weak whiffed move punishers
Vulnerable after blocked low attacks

There are endless pokes with Nina. I wrote my favorite pokes, so from
some examples you can create your style pokes.

1,2,1,4

1,2,1 db+3+4

1,2,1 d+1,~N~4

1,2,1 df+1,2

df+1,2 throw

df+1,2,N 1,2 d+3,d+4

1,2 d+1,~N~4 d+3,d+4

df+3,2,1,4

df+3,2,1 df+1,2 d+4,1 d+1,~N~4

df+3,2,3

d+4,1 d+1,~N~4 d+3,d+4

d+4,1 df,df+1

d+4,1 db+3+4

To get close to opponent from far use uf+1 or uf+4,3,4.

If opponent doesn't fight like a man and constantly tries to sidestep,
go for df+1+2 from close distance, 1+4 from medium distance and db+3+4
from far distance.

To set up multithrows first you must force opponent to afraid of
attacking. Then use qcf,2/Multithrow mix'up.

Your attacks constantly punished? Opponent overrides your hits?
Hayashida and 1+4 can be good option (beware of Stevens 3+4, 2), also
if your opponent whiffed slow recovery attack than go for db+3+4 after
hayashida step.

Nina has some mean juggles and okizeme

db+3+4, uf+3, d+4,1 f,f N d+4,1 uf+1
then use u+4(vs lying)/d+4,1(vs rising) mix'up
(d+3+4 is guaranteed after db+3+4, uf+3, d+4,1 uf+1 juggle)
d+4,1 juggles rising opponent, so do another d+4,1 uf+1+oki
(or wall hit after d+4,1) for some damage.

df+2, f,f, N 1, f,f, N 1, f,f, N 1, f,f, N 1, f,f, N 1,2 (wall hit)
then do wall combo 1,2,1,2,4,3

SS+2, d+4,1 d+4,1 uf+1 then go for standart d+3+4/u+4/d+4,1 mix'up.

HWOARANG
Master of Taekwon-Do, offensive kick machine. In T5 Bob is expanded to
some very painful juggles. If you like offensive fight style and have
time to learn this complex char - Bob is the right choice.

Pros
Sophisticated painfull juggles and wall juggles
Good okizeme
Legs kill CD moves
Stances and positions for all purposes
RFF backstep, wave dash, snake dash capable

Cons
Very few safe juggle starters (df+2, RFL df+4)
Nearly imposible to play against expert Steeve
Hard to learn

I won't go for custom string analysis because effective strings are
very circumstance dependant. You must know which hits are leading into
his stances, you must practice to do attack strings automatically and
know what to do from each stance. Don't use only legs with Bob, his
hands are also very usefull in constant attacking. Some Bob punches
and kicks offers frame advantage on block:
1,2,3 (2, 3) (+4 frames on block (Left flamingo))
1,2,4 (2, 4) (+4 frames on block (Right flamingo))
RFF 2 (+4 frames on block (RFF))
RFF 2,4~f_~b_~u (+4,+6 frames on block(RFL))
RFF 3~4,~f (+15 on block, usefull in juggles and near wall(RFL))
RFF f+3 (+12 on block (LFL))
RFF 4~f_~b_~d (+6 on block (RFL))
RFF d/f+4 ~F (+7 on block (RFL))
LFL 1 (+5 on block (LFF))
RFL 2,1 (+5,+1 on block (RFF))
RFL f+4 (+1 on block (RFL))
RFL df+4 (+2 on block)

Left foot forward and left flamingo stances are designed to brake
defence. Right foot forward and  Right flamingo - is for countering
and offence.

d+1 - quick sm punch
Use it for interuption reasons. It's quick, ducks under high attacks
and you get chance to pull ws hits.

b+3 - Lifting Leg Kick (Juggles)
Very usefull kick. Has range, hits grounded, launches for juggle and
could be used for okizeme. Though you are at frame disadvantage when
opponent blocks it.

CD+4 - Wing Blade  (Juggles)
f,N,d~d/f+4 - Electric Wing Blade  (Juggles)
One of the highest launchers in the game.
CD+4 3+4,~f,2,f+3,uf+3,4,3 - Sweet, painfull, high damage juggle.
JF version is safer on block.


db+4, ~f, RFL df+4
Guard braking attack. Don't use old db+4,4 (Second hit is high and
duckable), use RFL version istead.

LFL d+3,4
Good hits for guard breaking purposes. You can do this several times
(LFL d+3,4 3+4, d+3,4) and finsh with uninterruptable 4. Fast and safe
way go into left flamingo is 2,3.

LFF db+3
Decent low kick. Evades high hits and puts you into FC position.

WS+4,4
One of the best attack for Bob. It is safe, has good range and you are
in offensive RFF position. Safe way to finish wave/crouch dash and you
can use it after sucsesfull d+1.

b+3, 1,2,3,1 df+3+4
b+3, 3~4, df+3+4 (If you feel relaxed - use it)
b+3, f,f N 2,3,1 f,f N 2,3,1 f,f N 1,2,3,4 (Big thanks to Koreans)
b+3 2,4,2 f+3, uf+3,4,3
df+2 1,2,3,1 1,2,3,4 (Very abused)

wall juggles
LFF b+3/df+2
f,f, N 2,3,1 f,f, N 2,3,1 f,f N 1,2,4 (wall hit)
then RFL 2, RFF 4,3 (or 4,4) - (f,f, N 2,3,1 - is optional, you can do
it only 1x, if you see that opponent is near wall).

PANDA/KUMA
"It is big, slow, useless and funy looking animal which has no usefull
hits" - thats the most common stereotype of medicore tekken player. Let
me proove that you were wrong. Though if you want to win with Panda,
you must know most effective attacks and spend some time to learn this
char.

Pros
Jf power salmon huter
Style bonus
Good attacks from prowling bear stance


Cons
Impossible vs Steve and Nina
No fast medium range hits
Slow FC and WS hits
Guaranteed juggles do litlle damage

b,f+2+3  Hold Down 2+3    Power Salmon Hunter  (Unblockable)
Very high damage hit. Do this hit, if enemy hits wall after juggles and
is unable to avoid this killing hit. Also it is very usefull to do this
hit after demon bearfist (f,f+2).

f+1~1,1- Bear Cannon  (Juggles)
Use this combo, if you want to live in poke wars. Don't finish whole
string if first two hits are blocked. Guaranteed juggles after ch is
weak, so do f+1, uf+3+4, 1 for some damage.

f,f+2 - Demon Bearfist  (Juggles)
Pandas highest juggle launcher. I sugest you to learn JF power salmon
hunter and kill people after succsessfull demon bearfist.

b+3+4 - Double Mule Kick
This hit has very good evading properties. It can save your life, but
not much attack oportunities afterwards.

d/f+1+2 - Grizzly Headbutt
Good way to keep enemy at bay from close.

d/b+2 - LOW FISH CATCH
Annoying low attack.

u/f+3,4,1+2 - GRIZZLY RUSH
If you predict quick sm or low hits, lift little bit your opponent.

f,f+1+4 - Stone Head {1+2}
Decent two hand escape throw.

HCB,f+1+2 - Circus Roll {1+2}
Don't do this throw out from nowhere, buffer after decent recovery
hits.

FU/(FT_FA) d+1+2 - Spring Hammerpunch, (Sit Down)
FU/(FT_FA) 1+2 - BEAR BACKSTROKE
Use those hits on agressive opponent while getting up. Do 1/2 mixup
from Sit down position.


3+4 - Prowling bear stance
Intimidating stance, which leads into some damaging mix'ups. Do this
stance if you predict lots of high hits. Other safe way to go into
prowling bear stance - to do hits which leads into this stance.
If those hits connects - go into prowling bear, if not - train not to
go into this stance:
1+2                         Bear Knuckle
  >1+2                        Double Uppercut
    1+2                         BEAR HAMMER
  3+4                         (Prowling Bear)
---------------------------------------------
WS+1+2>1+2                  Double Uppercut
  3+4                         (Prowling Bear)
---------------------------------------------
FC,d/f+1+2                  REVOLUTION
  1                           DEATHPAW
  1+2                         ROLLING BEAR
  2                           UPPERSWIPE  (Juggles)
  3                           BUTT SCOOT
  3+4                         (PROWLING BEAR)
  4                           FLIPPER BEAR
----------------------------------------------
It is more damaging way to get up with prowling bear stance.
(FD/FA)_(FD/FT) 3+4         (Prowling Bear)

Hits from prowling bear:
1,2 - Low Hunting Claw, Bear Scratch, (Prowling Bear)
Two quick low hits. After them do 2(juggles)/1+2(juggles) mixup.

2 - Bear Scratch, (Prowling Bear)
If this hit connects go for 3+4 tackle.

1+2 - Paw lift
If you connect this lift, you are BT from you enemy. Press f then go
for b,f+2+3/b+1+2 f,d/f,d,d/b,b,u/b,u,U/F mixup.

3+4 - Bear tackle
Do this hit from distance on agressive opponent.

LAW MARSHALL
Very popular char among all types of tekken players.
He has it all - defence, offence, wall juggles, throws with damaging
follow'ups and many more advantages. Though you must use some of his
moves carefully against good player. Majority of his juggle launchers
leave him very vulnerable.

Pros
Fast punches
Best parries in the game
Good lows

Cons
Very vulnerable after majority juggle launchers


1, b+2,3,4~b~f~b~f  3 junkyard combo canceled into DSS is more useful
in juggles.

df+1,2,2,1
Annoying tenstring starter has very high priority. Go for d+2,3 after
this string if enemy tries to poke back with high attack.

df+1,3,2,2
Second low hit serves as good match ender, and rest hits adds more
annoyiance for enemy.

1~[1],[1],[1] - Punch Rush variations
Pressuring attack, which main purpose is to force opponent to do non
logical response. Use dragon knuckle ender 1~,1,1,1,f+2,>2,>2 to annoy.

1,2 f,f+3+4 (go for f,F+1, b+2,3,4~b~f~b~f  3 juggle)
1,2 df+1+2,1,2,1+2 (If you connect this throw - go for db+4/b+2,3,4
mix'up)
To set up mid attacks on turtling opp, go for throws.

1,2, uf+3 d,df,d,df+3
After fake somersault you recover in FC position so you can try slide.

1,2,3 - Punch Rush, Rush Fist, Rush Knee
Quick poking string, last hit is mid so opponent can't duck it, on CH
it knocks opponent down. Also you can use this string to "send" People
to wall, then go for 1~,1,1,1,f+2,2 wall juggle.

1,2 b,f,f+1
Very good string vs impatient opponent.


b+2+4~b,f 1
If high/mid parry connects go for guaranteed 1 from dragon stance.

b+1+2,1
(Hyah steeven) If punch is caught use tricky trap to turn opponent
around, than go for d+4,3 juggle or b+2,3,4 on backing enemy.

f+1+2
Good medium range hit whitch juggles on CH.


4,3~b~f~b~f, f+1
Throw first two hits, then watch enemy responce. If he immediately
attacks, do f+1 from DSS.

FC,d/f,d,d/f+3 - Dragon Slide
By far Law's best low attack. You get free 3 if slide connects. Mix'up
slide with WS+2 and WS+4.

db+4 - Dragon's Tail
Very risky low attack. If it is blocked - you screwed. Go for db+3 if
you connect this hit. Throw this vs Expert if you expect lots of high
hits.

df+2 - Lifting Uppercut  (Juggles)
Safe juggle launcher. It isn't that damaging like f+1+2 but it is one
of the safest juggle launchers.

WS+2 - Power Uppercut  (Juggles)
Law's highest juggle launcher. I prefer easy 4, b,f+2,3,4~b~f~b~f 3
ender.

db+3
Good recovery low attack. Very useful okizeme hit vs People which are
lying still. Juggles on CH (d+4,3) though don't overuse it.

d+4,3
Oki hit vs rising opponent.

b+3 - ROLLING RIGHT KICK
Power kick which is very useful near walls. If People likes to duck vs
Law, than they sure like to fly after this hit.

JIN KAZAMA
If you want to play effectively don't use him like T4 jin. Most popular
attacks from T4 is tonned down and he have some very useful attacks
added in T5.

Pros
High damage juggles
Fast attacks
Good pokes
Good attack interrupters
Wave dash, snake dash capable

Cons
Anemic fight style
Very vulnerable after some blocked hits
Weak wall juggles

1,2 -  1-2 Punches
3                           Axekick
  >4                          Roundhouse Kick
First two hits are very usefull quick poking attack. If you have
connected first two hits, then you must continue attack. Use >4
finisher vs agressive People. 1-2 punches and axekick is useful in
wall juggles ( f,F+1  f,F+1  f,F+1,2 (wall hit) 3, d+3+4).

d+3+4 - Can-Can Kicks  (Juggles)
Very risky juggle launcher. It is guaranteed after low parry. Also if
you opponent is very predictable with low or sm attacks this is
reliable launcher. Go for b,f+2,1 db+2,>2,3 juggle for some damage.

uf+4
Reliable, safe juggle launcher, which is usefull at medium distance.


d/f+1                       Side Punch
  >4                          Sidekick
  4~4                         HELL TRIP
df+1,>4 are fast two middle hits usefull in high pressure fights. You
will be very vulnerable if enemy blocks Hell Trip.

2,1                         Punch, Gutpunch
  4                           Sidekick
  4~4                         HELL TRIP
First two hits are not that fast as 1-2 Punches, but it still can serve
as alternate poking attack. It is very easy to buffer throw after
succsessfull second hit. Use side kick finisher to keep People at bay.

d+4 - Long Sweep
Good round finisher, though don't overuse it, bacause you will be at
serious frame disadvantage (for free ws attack) if opponent predicts
and blocks this hit.

f,N,d,d/f+1 - TWILIGHT GODFIST (Juggles)
f,N,d~d/f+1 - ELECTRIC TWILIGHT GODFIST  (Juggles)
Jins highest juggle launcher, go for damaging b,f+2,1 f+1, db+2,>2,3
juggle. Very useful from distance vs high hits and sometimes you can
mixup it with CD+4.

CD+4 - Hell Trip  (Juggles)
Decent juggling low attack. Use this to set up twilight godfist. Follow
hit with db+2,>2,3 juggle. Don't overuse it coz you are at serious
frame disadvantage on block.

f+4 - Mid Snapkick
Very good attack from distance. On ch it stuns, so you can follow stun
with f+4/CD+1/db+2,>2,3 your choice of attack.

ws+2
In my opinion it is more useful to do ws+2 instead of ws+1,2 because
it offers more damage oportunities. Use it after wave dash or ducked
high attack. I prefer 1,2 b,f+2,1,>2 juggle.

2,4 - Punch, Roundhouse Kick
One of the best attack for interuption purposes, also you can punish
whiffed hits with it. Follow attack with guaranteed f,F d+4. If this
string is blocked you aren't very vulnerable, because last hit keeps
opponent at bay.

f,f+2 - Demon Paw
Single power attack. Use it for same reasons like Devil Jins demon paw
or Pauls deathfist.

f,N,d,d/f+2                 Wind Hookfist
f,N,d~d/f+2                 Electric Wind Hookfist
Personally I use this attack very sparingly, because it doesn't have
damging follow'ups. Sometimes It is usefull to "send" opponent to wall
with this.

LEI WULONG
With Lei you have all tools to play with opponents mind. You can play
dead, roll back, stand, ha ha step, pervert step forward repeatidly,
attack from every position and stance to confuse your opponent. If you
force your opponent to be affraid of attacking, then 50% of fight you
have won already. There are no two same playing lei experts, you can be
original with this complex char. If you get chance to attack from
animal stances then your opponent must play gambling game, it means
that they have to guess which attack will strike them - low or mid.

Pros
Large movelist
Good mixups from many stances
Strong atacks from play dead position
Ha ha step capable
Versatile fighting style

Cons
Low damage
Very hard to learn
Weak wall game
Medicore okizeme
Vulnerable in stances

STEVE FOX
Here is the worst nightmare of every tekken player - master Steeven.
True delight for agressive/pitbull type players. Steeven Stifler
probably will win tournaments like Jin did it in t4. You simply don't
need to block majority of oponents hits, because you can simply counter
them. I don't want to be responsable for new Steeven users breeding,
so I won't go in to move and stance analysis.

Pros
Fast attacks from all ranges
Fast long range punches
Lethal wall juggles
Guard braking attacks

Cons
Very few low hits
Hard to learn
Some tkn players for unaccountable reasons doesn't pick Steeve

HEIHACHI MISHIMA
Poor old man. He has been tonned down so mutch times since T3 that I am
surprised how he walks witout stick. From lethal mishima character in
T3 or TTT he becames old marasmatic. Nina, Law, Steeve, Feng or other
fast chars will override majority attacks of Heihachi. But it doesn't
scares true Heihachi fans.
