| Version History |
+-----------------+

- 16/06/07: Version 4.1
  - A few minor fixes here and there. Punishment Lists 99.99% complete now
    (cleared issue on Raven's b+1+2,2 and Devil Jin's f,f+3,1,3_4).
  - Added a few small juggles (nothing too fancy unfortunately)

- 08/06/07: Version 4.0
  - Wow, I've done such a huge mistake. The "Punishment Lists" should be all
    right now. OK, Devil Jin's f,f+3,1,4 move is not punishable on block at
    all, whereas f,f+3,1,3 IS. The 4 ender is safe, but the 3 (which is low)
    can be punished with a FC,df+2. I didn't notice it before because TZ had
    the data for f,f+3,1,3 in place of f,f+3,1,4, and viceversa, but should
    be fixed now. I know, I know I'm not perfect...I should have noticed it
    before, but I have my mind too busy at times.
  - Added "Multithrows", a fairly long section within T5 strategies.

- 26/12/06: Version 3.5
  - Better specified notations in Conventions section. It should help those
    utterly unfamiliarized with the game now, also makes it clear that the
    guide can be used for both PS2 and arcade versions of T5.
  - Added entry for Sidethrows on Moves analysis section, some more comments
    on d/b+4, redone comments for u/b+1
  - Renamed "King in a nutshell" section, added Crushes in
  - Cleared comments on buffering Tombstone, added WS+4 and f+1,2 GS buffers
  - Corrected frame data for f,f+1+2 (source: inatekken web page)
  - Added "Ground damage decreased from 100% to 70%" in the "5.0 -> 5.1"
    changes section (I can't really believe I forgot to point that before)

- 19/09/06: Version 3.3
  - Redone analysis on 1,2>1 as an independent move
  - Fixed errors in movelist (FC+1 and FC+1,N+2 damage)
  - Added FC,d/f+2, ground throw combo (useful near walls)

- 05/08/06: Version 3.2
  - Added the URL of King's iSW thread in Tekken Zaibatsu forums.
  - Added Hop Rock Bottom buffer in the command throw buffers section

- 14/07/06: Version 3.1
  - Added u/f+4, f+1,2, f+1,2, f+2+4 juggle (beginner friendly, anyway)
  - Added u/f+4, 2,1, f+1+2, d+2+4 juggle (stylish, gives the option of ending
    into one of d+2+4 air multi's enders for more damage or end there and go
    straight into oki)
  - Added CH b+1, f,f+2,1, 1,2, iSW juggle on Marduk (thanks Dangerous King)
  - Added CH d/b+3, FC,d/b+(1+3)_(2+4) ground throw (can be broken but it's
    still dangerous around walls, EVEN IF OPPONENT BREAKS)
  - Added u/f+4, f+2,2, 1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,2 (w!), SSR f,N,d~d/f+1+2 (from

  - Added f+1,2, b+3 wall combo from u/f+4 and WS+1+2 wall splats
  - Changed layout for moves in move analysis
  - Added entries for air throws in move analysis

- 18/06/06: Version 3.0
  - Once again redone move analysis. All throws are in throws section, attacks
    under attacks' section. I also modified entries for several moves (WS+1+2,
    CD+1+2, f,f+2+3 and others) and added more info gathered from gameplay
    experience and other people's posts as well.
  - Added "Top 10 moves" section to make clear where's the good stuff and the
    "still-usable-but-not-as-good" moves.

| Intro to T5 King: "Not forced to throw anymore" |
+-------------------------------------------------+

TTT/T4 King: Poker-grappler
T5 King: Poker-grappler/CH hunter, random power striker

In past Tekken games, King's juggles were weak, and his command throws were
practically the only way to deal big damage with him. Thus, he had a hard time
trying to win against top or higher tier characters. Although helped by his
strong poking game, King's throws were still hard to setup and got horribly
punished via WS launchers once an opponent ducked after guessing that the grab
was coming. The fact that his u/f+4 juggles were weak turned him very throw
reliant. King's poke game was always fast and safe, but still weak damage when
compared to most characters' juggle starters.

However, those days are gone. King has become more of a bi-dimensional char,
able to survive even against the best top tiers. He has been given an actual
interrupting ability, along with stronger combo damage, which make him pretty
good at CH catching. While still retaining his trademark throw game, he's now
able to deal about a halfbar combo damage on a potential ducker, and interrupt
the opponent within setups with moves like his b+1. This gives him a double
strategy: 1) interrupt the opponent for CH damage when opponent is aggressive
and 2) play a mid-throw guessing game when opponent gets back into turtling.

This is not to say his offense is perfect, though. King still has a major hole
in his game: lack of mid-range launchers. He has poor offense at mid range as
almost all of his mid-range moves are either slow, high or punishable. Namco
also refused to give King users a Mishima-style type of wavedash to close the
gaps while still keeping reasonable offense at hand. (The fact that backdash
is toned down doesn't really help him at mid-range offense; just to return
back to close range and attack from there with less risk of whiffing.) King
still keeps his own wavedash in Tekken 5, but it's really hard to master and
often players don't incorporate it into their games for this reason.

Given that his offense is hampered at mid range (but not a lot of characters
have such a great offense from mid range, either - plus you can overcome this
weakness much easier than back in TTT days), he does better at close range
offense AND TURTLING. This is true: King has good turtling ability, he can do
decently at block-punishing, he gets a strong juggle after blocking lows with
u/f,N+4, WS+1+2 and FC,d/f+2, he also gets juggle after a low parry in most
cases, and has right punch and kick reversals, giving him an extra edge at
defense.

Where King fails at keeping them at bay, due to lack of mid range stuff - he
will do better after sidestepping, due to more damaging hopkick juggles (SS,
u/f+4 is now an actual way to go).

King's strengths:

- Good poking game
- Good mid attacks. Strong mid/throw mixup especially at close range
- Good throwing game
- Good CH and interrupting game
- GOOD juggles (finally!)
- Decent SS game
- Decent CD game
- Unchickenable kick and right punch reversals. Good low parry followups

King's weaknesses:

- Lack of good lows (the ones he has are decent at best)
- Lack of fast, damaging whiff punishers at mid range (unless opponent has
  back close to walls - b+3 if that's the case) and good mid/long range
  offense in general
- The majority of King's most damaging combos are very hard to pull off. 
  Specially the ones making use of iSW enders and ground throws by the wall

| Conventions |
+-------------+

This is the conventions' section (also known as the "you SHOULD know all this
already" section). This is all common, standard Tekken notations used to make
reference to specific character move.

Basic commands:

1   = left punch       2   = right punch
3   = left kick        4   = right kick

(In the PS2 console version, these are arranged by default on the PS2's
controller pad as follows:

Square: 1 (left punch)      (L1, L2, R1 and R2 - no use)
Triangle: 2 (right punch)
X: 3 (left kick)
Circle: 4 (right kick)

However, you can reconfigure those buttons as well as the L1, L2, R1 and R2
wing buttons as you wish at the Options Menu - which is one of the reasons
you won't see Tekken move notations involving the PS2 controller's buttons).

f   = forward          u   = up         N = neutral (no joystick or pad tap)
b   = back             d   = down
u/f = up/forward       u/b = up/back
d/f = down/forward     d/b = down/back

Capital letters in a command mean to hold down the joystick/pad in the 
required direction.

HCB = half circle back = f,d/f,d,d/b,b
HCF = half circle forward = b,d/b,d,d/f,f
QCB = quarter circle back = d,d/b,b
QCF = quarter circle forward = d,d/f,f
CD  = crouch dash motion = f,N,d,d/f

+   = Simultaneously (ex. f+4 means tap forward and press 4 at once)
_   = Or (ex: 1+4_2+3 means either 1+4 or 2+3)
*   = Hold button(s) down. (ex: u/f+1+2* = tap up/forward while HOLDING 1+2)
,   = Followed by (ex. 1+2,2 means press 1+2, then press 2)
~   = INMEDIATELY followed by (ex. 4~3 press 4 and quickly press 3 afterwards)
>   = Next input is delayable (ex. 1>2 means either 1,2 or 1 *brief pause* 2)
:   = Just frame input; precise timing required (else the move won't execute)
=   = Possible next sequence after a prior command
()  = Group different possible commands (ex. (b_d/f)+1 means b+1 or d/f+1)
[]  = Group optional command(s) (ex. [d/f+1,]2,3 means 2,3 or d/f+1,2,3)
{}  = Missing hit(s) required (ex. 1,{2},3 means the 2 must miss the opponent)

FC  = In Full Crouch, duck/crouching state (after holding down, or after moves
      that put your character in crouch. Ex: FC+1 while crouching, press 1)
WS  = While Standing (rising from a crouch - achieve crouch state, then let
      the joystick/pad return to neutral. Ex: WS+2 means go into crouch, N+2 -
      let the stick or pad neutral while pressing 2)
WR  = While Running (after f,f,f or f,F if 3 steps or more away from opponent)
BT  = With your Back Turned to your opponent (e.g. BT 3 means with your back 
      turned to the opp, press 3).
SS  = Side-Step either way (u~N into background or d~N into foreground) (Ex:
      SS+2 means while side-stepping, press 2; either u~N+2 or d~N+2).
SSL = SS left (to your character's left side)
SSR = SS right (to your character's right side)

Hit levels:

h  = high (can be blocked standing, or ducked under; misses a crouching foe)
m  = mid (must be blocked standing; hits a crouching foe)
sm = special mid (can be blocked either standing or crouching)
l  = low (must be blocked crouching; hits a standing foe)
Capital letters (e.g. M, SM or L) mean the move also hits a grounded opponent.

 !  = unblockable
<!> = unblockable, but can be ducked (misses a crouching foe)
[!] = unblockable which hits grounded opponents
*!* = unblockable which hits big grounded opponents

Throw types:

Front  = front throw (catches standing opponent, face towards King)
Left   = left side throw (catches standing opponent, left side towards King)
Right  = right side throw (catches standing opponent, right side towards King)
Back   = back throw (catches standing opponent, back towards King)
Crouch = crouch throw (catches ducking opponent, face towards King)
Air    = air throw (catches opponent in mid-air, face up & feet towards King)
Any    = catches any position except airborne opponents

Stances:

RC  = This move recovers in crouching position
RCj = This move may recover in crouching
BT  = This move ends with back turned to opponent
KND = This move recovers in the knockdown position (face up, feet towards) 
PLD = This move recovers in "play dead" position (face up, feet away)
FCD = This move recovers in "face down" position (face down, feet towards)
SLD = This move recovers in sliding position (face down, feet away)

Moves' properties:

CH  = counter hit (hitting during your opponent's move execution)
GB  = move causes guard break (opponent recovers slower when blocked)
BS  = move causes block stun (to attacking character, when blocked)
GC  = guard crouch (opponent recovers in crouching position)
OB  = forces opponent's back to face your character
OS  = forces opponent's side to face your character
KND = move puts opponent into knockdown position
PLD = move puts opponent into "play dead" position
FCD = move puts opponent into "face down" position 
SLD = move puts opponent into sliding position
JG  = juggles/launches into the air on hit
BN  = bounces on hit (opponent cannot techroll)
SH  = staggers on hit (opponent goes backwards and may fall to the ground)
KS  = kneeling stun (opponent will recover crouching on hit)
MS  = minor stun (usually no guaranteed followups)
DS  = double over stun (escaped with ~f - tap f quickly after being hit)
FS  = fall back stun (escaped with ~f)
CS  = crumple stun (not escapable)
b   = block modifier (ex. OSb: forces opponent's side to face you on block)
c   = counter hit modifier (ex. CSc: crumple stuns on CH; BNc: bounces on CH)
co  = crouch hit modifier (ex. KSco: knee stuns on crouching opponents)
cl  = clean hit modifier (ex. KNDcl: knocks down on clean hit)
[#] = causes this property on # hit of a string (ex. OC[1]: first hit forces
      opponent to crouch; JG[2]: second hit will juggle)

Crush types:
TC = Technically Crouching during the move ("crushes" highs; this move can
     duck under the opponent's high moves for some, or all, of the animation's
     frames)
TJ = Technically Jumping during the move ("crushes" lows, and some special mid
     moves, such as d+1; this move can jump over lows for some, or all, of the
     animation's frames)

Notations related to Tekken 5 King only:

JGS = Jaguar Step (on normal standing position, push and hold 3+4)
iSW = Instant Shining Wizard (f~f,f+2+4 - convention used in combos)
GS  = Giant Swing (f,HCF+1 - convention used in combos)

Moves with name in capital letters are new in Tekken 5. Unlike Catlord's move
list, I only capitalized the brand new T5 King moves and not the older ones
whose command inputs have changed (e.g. King's u/f+3+4).

#1 Also press 1 during the throw animation to break. The Arm Lock Face Buster
   cancels the Pile Driver, therefore its damage doesn't add to Pile Driver.
#2 Input the proper break during the Pile Driver animation.
#3 If the opponent escapes any of the following links, King suffers 10 damage.
#4 If King grabs the opponent's side or back, Cannonball Buster will be the 
   first part of the multithrow. If King grabs the opponent's back, then the
   Cannonball Buster cannot be escaped.
#5 Break is 1 if throw input was done with 1+3 and 2 if it was done with 2+4.
#6 Break is 1 if throw input was done with 1+4 and 2 if it was done with 2+3.
#7 Chains into Cannonball Buster links (from Full Nelson Drop series).
#8 Can be techrolled to reduce damage by 10. In Tekken 5.0, damage is 35 on
   wall hit.
#9 King can't do the Cross Arm Lock or Cross Leg Lock when tackling the back.
   Ultimate Tackle escapes:
 - Input 2 while being tackled to dodge the tackle.
 - Input 1+2 right when your back hits the floor to reverse the tackle; you
   can continue with your own tackle options afterwards
 - Input 1+2,2,2,2,2 after being tackled to escape Cross Arm Lock (King, Paul,
   Jin, Devil Jin, Nina & Marduk can reverse by tapping 2 once more)
 - Input 1+2,1,1,1,1 after being tackled to escape Cross Leg Lock (King, Nina
   & Marduk can reverse by tapping 1 once more)
 - Input 2 to block the first 1 (left Mounted Punch) or 1 to block the first
   2 (right Mounted Punch). Paul can reverse the first Punch with 1,1,2.

   Smash causes Double Over Stun on CH; the stun can be escaped, but doing
   this will not prevent the throws from happening.

#3 Throw part comes out on a standing opponent in close range from the front.

#1  This move causes CS on a front hit or JG if it hits from the side or back.
#2  Hits high at the start of the move OR low at the end. GB if blocked high.
#3  King recovers FCD if the move whiffs or is blocked or hits a grounded
    opponent. Causes MS if hits from side or back or on a crouching opponent.
#4  Does 25 damage on a close hit or 18 damage on far or ground hit.
#5  Rib Buster must make contact (hit or block) for this move to come out.
#6  King will recover in FCD if the move is blocked or whiffs.
#7  King will recover in KND if the move whiffs.
#8  Ali Kick properties:
    - First Ali Kick can also be done as FC,d/f+4; damage is 10 when no second
      kick is buffered; the third Ali Kick will cause knockdown if it hits the
      opponent's back.
    - If the first Ali Kick is a CH, the third kick does 5 damage pts instead
      of 7 (irregardless of whether you choose to do Spin Upper, Extended Ali
      Kicks, or nothing); also in this case, the third kick causes a longer
      minor stun if hits (enough for King to get free FC/WS moves).
    - Spin Upper (after 2 or 3 Ali Kicks) and Extended Ali Kicks are possible
      only if the first Ali Kick was a CH. The last hit of the Extended Ali
      Kicks causes minor stun (long enough for King to get free FC/WS moves).
#9  Hits high at the start or mid at the end.
#10 Right punch reversal. Damage in Tekken 5.1 is standard reversal damage
    (damage of reversed move plus 25 points).
#11 Left kick reversal, does standard reversal damage
#12 Right kick reversal, does standard reversal damage
#13 Dancing animation can't be cancelled, but King remains charged after the
    dance is over.

Brainbuster Suplex      [f+]2+4                    front throw      2

The basic throws, which are OK for a simple mixup. Both of them will leave the
opponent in the PLD position (face up and feet towards), nothing is guaranteed
but you have a good wakeup game. Sometimes 1+3 leaves King in BT if done near
the wall (the exact circumstance for this to happen evades me at this moment),
and 2+4 switches sides with your opponent. They are also the basic airthrows;
this kills the old tactic of doing jumping moves to avoid being thrown.

Giant Swing             f,HCF+1                    front throw      1

10 frames, long range and good damage (mad damage if King throws them into a
wall) make this one the most dreaded of King's throws. A wall hit also leads
to extra guaranteed followups if in range. Hands down, the best throw in the
game, much to the displeasure of Julia's Mad Axes fans ;)

Tombstone Pile Driver   d/b,f+2                    front throw      2

Does huge damage, but the range is kind of short. Still a good throw because
it can be buffered much like the GS. It leaves them in PLD position at close
distance, so good wakeup games afterwards. A d+4 is guaranteed on Jack-5 and
Kuma/Panda (you can also try d+3). If you're quick, a d+3+4 might catch them
just before they get up.

Muscle Buster           QCB+1+2                    front throw      1+2

King's best 1+2-break throw, if you can get it. Looks cool, and you get some
good oki after it, a free BT 3 on most characters (on male characters, wait a
split second before hitting BT 3; the kick won't hit females, Roger or Wang).
You can also get BT d+4, FC+3+4,2 for a mini-juggle if they try to move, or go
for BT 1+4 if they stay there. This throw also tracks slightly both directions
and switches sides with the enemy, being useful near walls. Its range is that
of a basic throw.

Shining Wizard          (WR_f,f,f)+2+4             front throw      1+2

Another good throw to mix up with GS, great priority, 1+2-break and its range
make it very good. Learn to use the iSW (instant Shining Wizard) to grab them
often. WR+2+4 is very obvious so mix that up with WR+1+3/GS from time to time.
It leaves them face up, side towards King, an f+3 is very likely to hit moving
opponents (it seems to hit Kuma...even if he doesn't move?) Free df+4 on bigs.
This throw also switches sides if the opponent breaks it. The command is hard
to pull out, f,f,f+2+4 is not easy to execute when King is only a dash away 
from his opponent, so you may have to spend a lot of time practicing the iSW
motion, but it's worth every bit of it.

Not very damaging, but the best throw in terms of tracking. However, it does
have slightly shorter range than basic throws, and comes out 1 frame slower
as well. All options afterwards (including N, or b+1+2 by itself) have some
guaranteed followups. A great throw against the wall, since it leads to wall
splat. Note that b+1+2~3+4 leaves you BT'ed for a free shot on your back if
escaped, so beware of abusing it.

present, but it's an actual justframe, it takes mad timing to pull it out.

V Driver                d+2+4                      crouch throw     2

These crouch throws can be used after low parry, if the hopkick doesn't reach.
But aside from that, both of them are useless for the most part, as they will
miss if the opponent does any move (unless it's a TC move, which can be crouch
thrown out of if you have enough time, or a TJ move, because they will become
the air multithrow starter). Overall, any solid mid attack like d/f+1>2 is way
better than crouch throws, because not only it does hit any ducking opponent,
but it also hits them out of FC and WS moves, and it still hits them when they
are ducking while side or back turned; both things that the crouch throws just
can't do.

Argentine Backbreaker   any throw (at opp's left)     side throw     1
Knee Crusher            any throw (at opp's right)    side throw     2

I just mention these because they do decent damage and give really great oki.
After the left sidethrow, King has a guaranteed u/f+2+4, and after the right
one, there is a free ground throw mixup or d/b+3 or d/b+4 or u/f+3. But don't
expect to nail many of these - sidethrows are probably the most broken throws
in Tekken. They always have the same escape, depending on the side which is
thrown, no matter what throw you used. If you find yourself at your opponent's
side, it's better to hit u/f+4 and start a sidejuggle.

Stretch Buster          (behind opponent) b,f+1+2     back throw     none

Major props if you can get this one against a skilled opponent. There are some
setups for this move, such as the b+1+2,1+2 Irish Whip (which will turn their
back while keeping them close to you), but it's far from guaranteed as long as
your enemy can duck before it comes out. However, it does come to my attention
that when doing the b,f+1+2 on the backturned opponent, if he/she turns around
before being thrown, the grab will become the Muscle Buster! This is very good 
indeed, since King still does great damage, if the opponent doesn't escape (I
don't know if it's escapable under this circumstance, I guess it probably is,
but I never had it broken in the few, rare ocassion I landed it) and means the
throw was positively improved from earlier games (because if you attempt this
same thing in Tekken 3, Tag or 4, King's hands would go through the opponent,
leaving him completely open to an enemy blow).

Aerial Leg Screw        (opponent airborne) [f+]2+4    air throw    none

Out of the basic airthrows, this is the one you will land the most, since it's
easier for King's right hand to make contact with the opponent's left foot. He
basically does the same animation of his right kick reversal, switching sides
with the opponent and leaving him/her in standard knockdown position. However,
there's nothing for free afterwards, although you're able to catch a back roll
with u/f+1+2 or try f,f+2+3 if they lay there, or attempt a CD or maybe a JGS
mixup if they quickrise. It's not really a bad airthrow, but given enough time
and practice, you can always replace this with air f,HCF+1 or f,f,f+2+4.

Running Jaguar Bomb     (opponent airborne) f,HCF+1    air throw    none
Running Jaguar Bomb     (opponent airborne) f,f,f+2+4  air throw    none

This move is responsible for King's new great damage juggles. Not only it does
huge damage for a juggle ender - it will also make King run forwards quite a 
distance (carrying them towards walls nicely) and leaving them at your mercy
in standard KND position right at your feet, once again nothing is guaranteed,
but you can go into your average wakeup games from there (d/f+1,2 or even f+3
pickup if they quickrise, or ground throw if they stay on ground). The air GS
version is much easier to land, it does a bit less damage, but allows for the
same wakeup games. Furthermore, in some juggles such as u/f+4, f+1+2, f+3, GS,
it's the only option for an airthrow at this point, since an iSW requires more
time and room to execute and hence it's less practical.

The iSW airthrow is one of those advanced tools able to turn the match's tide
in your favor whenever you land it, so be prepared to sit down and spend a few
weeks (or months) in Practice Mode in order to make your King truly dreaded!

= Mini Swing        = 2,1,3,4                          link         2

King's air multi can be used to finish some juggles, and as an air hit it can
connect pretty low to the ground, provided that they're close enough. It also
hits on a grounded character rolling forwards or backwards (easier to land if
they're rolling forwards, as the range on d+2+4 is very short). Basically, it
is an airthrow which hits lower than regular airthrows, and leaves you with

Use these as part of King's CD game: mix both CD+1+4 and CD+2+3 with CD to mid
hits like CD~WS+1+2, CD,u/f+4, etc. The CD multithrows are much faster now, so
they're more likely to throw them. Also, unlike other throws, both CD+1+4 and
CD+2+3 share the same grab animation (i.e. there's no visual difference before
King makes contact; in both grabs, King's hands are extending equally far). Be
warned that a CD doesn't cover that much ground and is mostly used to go under
the opponent's high attacks.

SS Full Nelson Drop [cancel]    SS+2+4[~B]         front throw      1+2

The SS+2+4~B can be used as emergency maneuver to evade most things in a hurry
(Obviously, King's big sliding SS will be nullified if there was a wall at the
side you were sidestepping to, so keep that in mind). The cancel recovers too
slow to go for a FC or WS move before they attack, and the actual multithrow
gets escaped (if not ducked) often, so it's wise to just keep it short.

Cobra Clutch            JGS 2+3                    front throw      2

Not as useful as the CD multithrow starters. It's much harder to setup and get
it to land because you can't cancel the JGS inmediately into a standing guard,
and the fact that a random jab can juggle you doesn't help either. In the rare
event of landing the JGS multi starter, 1,4,2,3 is the obvious choice, then it
gets easy, VERY EASY to break. Although you may be able to kill your opponent
by taking the longest path, most of the links will do little damage, and more
links mean more break points, so this doesn't have an extremely good payoff.

New to T5 King, d/f,d/f+1+3 is the same as d/f,d/f+2+4 but with 1 as break, so
you can now mix these two up to prevent escapes. As with the standard crouch
throws, they can be used after low parry (the low parry will act as the first
d/f in the input sequence). Besides that, they have the same flaws of regular
crouch throws which I already explained in depth before.

Figure Four Leg Lock    (opp KND) (N_FC),D/B+2+4   ground throw     2

Use these for the ground throw mixup; d/b+(1+3_2+4) is sort of weak, as they
can tech afterwards (unless you toss them into a wall). Also, notice that they
can be done out of FC in T5, plus you can also mix them up to make them harder
to escape, no matter what their grounded position is (other grounded positions
will give you different ground throws, but they're a mixup and there's not an
unique break depending on the position anymore).

Oh, and definitely use these after wall combos; if they break them, you get a
free b+3 for more wall combos or a well timed f,f,f+2+4 (iSW) for a backthrow.
The ground throw attempt is hard to get at this point, but it's guaranteed as
long as you do it right. More on this further in the combo/juggle section.

1 is 9 frames, +2 on block, which makes 1 (blocked), 1,2 uninterruptable. The
f+1 is 10 frames but does more damage, and gives the same advantage on block.
1 alone is of King's best pressuring tools, specially when it comes to beat 8
framers.

= V Driver                      = d+2+4         crouch throw     Break 2

1,2 is 9 frames, -1 on block. It's a good jail string combo, but has a bit of
disadvantage on guard, meaning you can't keep the pressure well with the 1,2
alone. However, this is the start of the 1,2>1 strings. Those throws aren't
really worth the effort (even though you can consider using 1,2,2+4 once in a
while, assuming you have mixed with 1,2, GS and 1,2 into mids properly)

Furthermore, if the 1,2 is blocked and you are sure they will beat you with
their move, you can also backdash, do a reversal, SS, etc. You don't have to
play offense all the time.

= V Driver                     = d+2+4          crouch throw     Break 2

Here is where things become interesting. As the command implies, the last hit
of 1,2>1 can be delayed. This can be tempting, because if the last 1 is a CH,
you have a guaranteed 2,1 (unless the opponent was way too far, or if they eat
the 1,2 before the last 1 hit; if that's the case, they often get pushed back)
If the last 1 is blocked, you remain completely safe; no move can punish you.

If you fear the range problem, you can go for the 4th and 5th hits of his ten
hit string (1,2>1,1,2); as in the above case, if the 3rd hit is a CH, then the
rest is guaranteed, however this comes at the sacrifice of safety - you can be
punished after the 5th hit on block by 10 frame moves. Furthermore, if you are
greedy, you can replace those 4th and 5th hits with the canned 2+4 (since they
cannot duck in this case, just break it) or a very fast GS (very hard to do it
fast before they can duck, but possible) for a good 50/50 guessing game where
you're rewarded with 40+ damage if they guess wrong.

1,2>1 can be used for pressure, since if they try to attack after the 2, the
last 1 will CH them, so you can hit 2,1 for free. Consider 1,2>1 an equivalent
of Nina's 1,2>3 or Bryan's 1,2>1 (although has arguably a much weaker payoff),
and mix it up with other options after 1,2.

Two mid-hit combo. This is what you mixup your throws with. Learn to always
delay SLIGHTLY the 2 for better frames (i.e. advantage) on hit and block. It
is good for punishing certain moves on block (Julia's 1~1,1 etc.) and duckers
in general. It becomes unsafe if not delayed and blocked by the wall. Still,
this is King's best mid move because of its good speed, decent range, damage
and safety.

Low Jab, Upper                (d_FC)+1,N+2      sm,m

Very short range high crusher. Fast, kills jabs and high stuff up close, but
barely safe on block. It whiffs often, if you're not careful about the range.
Don't be surprised if you see d+1 interrupting a TC move and the N+2 missing
completely. Also, watch out if the d+1 whiffs, because the weak push-back on 
the N+2 will vanish completely, which means you'll eat jabs on block. Be very
careful when using this move, or better yet - don't use it at all. I advice 
to use d+2 instead of d+1,N+2 (despite being 1 frame slower) because it does
more damage (than a d+1 alone I mean), it has better frames on block and hit,
it has longer reach (also slightly longer than standing jabs, surprisingly)
while still keeping the TC properties of d+1. You may disagree with this, but
it's far better to sacrifice those 8-10 extra points of damage if that means
decreasing the probabilities of whiffing your move to an acceptably low level.
This move was once a great lifesaver for King in earlier Tekkens, but in its
current form, it has been weakened so much that it's near to useless.

Arguably King's best new move. It has sheer speed, good reach and stuns on CH.
A normal hit gives you good frame advantage, thus you can also buffer throws
from here. Safe on block - overall it works much like a mid range magic 4. It
also has a secondary role of punishing your opponent's moves when you're too
far for jab strings to reach. It's one of his best moves, just don't abuse it,
or they will start ducking.

Water Parting Chop              u/b+1           h                SH

It's a wrestling slap, fairly strong on hit but slow, easily ducked and also
jab punishable if blocked at close range, but it's actually VERY HANDY against
certain characters. It's the best cure against Baek's triple SSL; it covers a
pretty wide area from King's front to his left side, thus it's useful for the
purpose of tracking. If that's not good enough, King also does a small SSL as
he does the move, you can perform it during a SSL for increased evasion effect
and even better tracking to your left side. On hit, it deals a good chunk of
damage and causes a brief stagger giving King the initiative. Aside from that,
there's little reason to attempt this move, as it comes out slowly and leaves
you vulnerable if blocked, despite the fact that most of the time King seems
to end a bit off-axis on block and therefore he might not eat some jab strings
in it's totality (f+1,2 for most characters still should work).

Jaguar Straight                 f,f+1           h                OSb KND

High strike, slow but safe on block. On hit gives free oki - d+3+4 or FC,df+3.
The positioning after it hits is really sweet, you can also pickup with f,f+3.
If blocked, it turns their right side towards King, and you can evade ANY move
the opponent tries with a simple SSL. This can be used sometimes as a punisher
for whiffs, but f+1+2 is still better, basically due to longer range, slightly
more damage and gives better oki on a far hit. The only real advantages that
f,f+1 has over f+1+2 is that it can be done out of CD, and is a bit better on
block, however those plusses don't quite make up for all the other advantages
that f+1+2 has.

Leg Breaker                     FC,d/f+1        L                JG

Very slow and lowparriable on reaction. On the good side, it does crush highs
consistently and juggles on hit. That being said, it's better to save this for
oki or post low block stun. It's good to learn those f,f+3 juggles, as this is
one of the few launchers that can ALWAYS hit after blocking Roger Jr's SS+4,
Law's d/b+4, etc. On block, this move is good bait for King's reversals...but
that's if they block it.

Straight, Upper                 2,1             h,m

10-frame jab combo, 0 on block. Good to poke, annoy and set up throws. However
it's not a jail string, meaning they might reverse or punch parry the 1 after
blocking the 2, but this happens very sparingly, if it does (it's very hard to
do, but it's possible). Good advantage on hit, plus it doesn't push them away
on hit as much as other moves, which is why you see King players buffering
throws a lot from 2,1 since day.

f+2 has decent reach, hits high but it's safe, hence is an OK poke sometimes.
f+2,2 (no delay between hits) is a natural combo, but cannot be used to poke
that often because they can block the first hit and duck the second. It's more
useful for punishing some moves that push away on block (like Mishimas' WS+4,4
tsunami kicks) or juggle filler. If for some act of God you get the third hit
on CH, the d+3+4 is free. The full string can be used an as easy juggle ender,
but it's better to stick with iSW airthrow for that purpose.

f,f+2~1 is pretty good to punish backrollers up close, as f,f+2 picks them off
ground and the 1 lands in mid air, and then you can continue juggling (a bonus
is that you're safe from wakeup kicks if you whiff the whole thing). It's also
used in wall combos, right after wall stun, but usually unreliable and/or hard
to land. A f,f+2 alone is better to force mixups on a techroller. This string
combos on CH, even if the 1 is delayed a lot, but due to the slow speed on the
first hit, the CH will never happen.

This looks different compared to his old FC,d/f+2 launcher, but it's the same
move in the end. Strictly used to punish blocked sweeps (post low block stun),
since it recovers horribly on block. f+3 hits afterwards for some nasty juggle
damage. Side note, if you do the move after blocking a sweep from max range,
it hits but then you're out of range to juggle. In these cases, the FC,d/f+1
gives you much better positioning. FC,d/f+2 does slightly less damage (21 pts
to be exact) in the 5.1 version of the game. On a side or back hit, this move
will launch instead of causing the usual crumple stun on a front hit, after a
back hit if you're not too far you can still juggle with f+1, f+2,2,2.

Decent SS poke, fast enough to punish after SS'ing an enemy attack. If you do
the sidestep to their weakest side (which you should be always doing), you'll
have even more chances to hit them. This is safe on block for the most part if
spaced out right (few characters can really punish on block), unless of course
it was blocked near walls, and even then only jabs or fast 4s can punish. On a
hit, SS+2 makes them stagger for a few frames, which is usually good for iSW
setup or maybe CD mixups.

A slow two mid-hit combo. It does solid damage by itself, and knocks down for
momentum or wall splat, allows for decent wall combos. It's barely unsafe on
block, a few characters in the game can launch King after blocking this (Bryan
being one of them), the rest of the cast gets maybe some fast long poke. This
does work better from a SS since it's slow and linear, hence they might easily
interrupt it with just about anything. It's also useful after parrying a low
kick (if their back is to the wall or if the hopkick doesn't reach them) or as
punisher after some moves on block (again, if u/f+4 doesn't reach).

One of King's weak whiff punishers. It's not as fast as it looks, but it does
have a lot of range. You can use this to punish some moves that have good push
back on block, like Baek's CD+3 or Julia's SS+3+4. On hit, it gives free BT 3
(must delay it a little to get it guaranteed), or d/b+3_d/b+4_u/f+3 or even a
ground throw attempt, depending of your positioning afterwards (if you did it
from far range, or after a push back move, the opponent usually falls right in
front of King). It can also be used to close mid gaps, and tracks slightly an
opponent's SSR. Very safe move, unless it gets ducked.

Slow oki move, more for show-off if anything IMHO. Guaranteed after both kick
reversals, the b+1+2~3+4 and the b,f+1+2 backthrow I think, but not that much
besides a followup for those grabs. It's usually overshadowed by u/f+3 (which
does a bit less damage, but comes out much faster) in most situations.

Capital Punishment              u/f+1+2         m                OCb JG

Same move from T4/TTT. Pretty slow windup, extremely SSable, and random jabs
will float King out of it. However, it gives King advantage on block, juggles
on any hit (a CH means better juggles though) and has good range. Very useful
on backrollers and for crushing lows, specially wakeup sweeps from a grounded
position (does much better than u/f+4 at that). u/f+1+2 is also the only King
move that normally doesn't hit ground, but can hit a grounded Jack-5 or Kuma,
just as it used to do in previous Tekken games (all other moves that used to
do this in the past, such as WS+4, d/f+1 and CD+4, have lost this property).

Guard Breaker                   f,f,N+1+2       m                GB MSc

An offensive push. It doesn't do any damage, but hits quickly and breaks their
guard, allowing for a free b+3 on counterhit. If the opponent's back is close
to a wall and f,f,N+1+2 connects on CH, then you get free u/f+4 and subsequent
wall splat. This move is very fast, hits mid, and tracks to King's right, but
it has really short range, so it's more useful and deadly near walls. Learn to
"see" the minor stun effect on CH, so you can get your free followups and not
get blocked or whiff if the move doesn't connect on CH. If this move connects
on regular hit, the opponent is pushed back just a bit, nothing is guaranteed,
but your foe is still at frame disadvantage, so you can buffer GS or try iSW,
or a b+1 if they try something stupid (can only be crushed). If the opponent
blocks it, you can still interrupt most moves with King's jabs.

Black Bomb              f,N,d,d/f+1+2           m                KND BNc

One of King's most powerful CH juggle starters. Black Bomb recovers horribly
slow on block so that nearly every character gets free launchers on you, but
it's fairly fast and has some good priority, thus you can actually beat other
moves with it. Furthermore, CH CD+1+2 leads to massive damage combos (about 70
or 90 damage depending on your air iSW skills) and CH'ing with this move can
really decide the round; so you should think about using it, even if sparingly
at least.

Actually, it's also possible to space yourself out of range before attempting
the CD+1+2 so if your opponent blocks, the move pushes away on block reducing
the amount of punishment to eat (for example: if you hit SS+2, u/b+1, or the
f+4 in the 5.0 version of this game - the small stagger these 3 moves create
will push them back, and here is when you can attempt a CD+1+2 without risks
of being interrupted and if blocked, they will be too far for some close range
launchers to hit you - for instance Jin's d+3+4 or u/f+4 will not reach King). 
Another situation where the CD+1+2 is usable, is against people who do wakeup
kicks from grounded, as it beats them easily for the CH bounce.

European Uppercut       (WS_f,N,d,d/f,N)+1+2    m                JG

An average WS launcher, very useful to punish ducked throws, high attacks and
those blocked lows. It also comes out of CD easily, can avoid highs decently,
and is completely safe on block. This move also has suprisingly good tracking.
I've seen King trying to follow Xiaoyu when she was doing her f,f+3+4 move, in 
which she jumps high over her opponent and ends facing his/her back, and King
literally turned 180 degrees attempting to follow her! This move can even be 
used as pickup in okizeme, because if it lands on a rolling opponent, you can
tack on a d/f+1,2, d+3+4,2 small juggle easily. The flaws of WS+1+2 are mostly
in its rather slow speed, and the range which isn't that good (even though the
move has "ghost range" in that its hitbox is larger than the actual animation
shows), thus it's far from abusable. Still one of King's greatest assets, so 
keep it in mind.

Lots of priority, but not that much reach (which is why it was dubbed "King's
flash"). This move has very good properties; on block, it gives advantage and
1,2 or 2,1 afterwards can't be interrupted or ducked; on hit, it sort of draws
them closer to King, which makes up for a godlike throw setup. Still, I'd like
to emphazise its modest range, plus it has an annoying trend to whiff ducking
opponents (unless they're big characters). Cannot be reversed.

Shoulder Tackle                 f+2+3           m                OCb KND

Shoulder charge. A risky move, but somewhat useful for closing gaps. It works
nicely vs backdash, sway/hayashida, Marduk's VTS backdash, etc. Semi-safe on
guard, depending on your distance before the move was blocked (free WS+4 if
blocked up close). An interesting note about f+2+3 is that you can actually
perform it from BT stance for a brief amount of time after ending backturned
(enter the command as if King was normally facing forwards); by doing this,
King will run away from his enemy creating a lot of space in a hurry, getting
himself out of some dangerous situations (if they try to run up and chase you,
you're still able to CH BT 3 'em out of moves). This move is very linear (but
still has good chances of hitting big chars in the midst of their SS) and has
a huge lag on whiff, so don't get predictable with it.

Not extremely useful unless it's in a guaranteed situation, or in wall combos
and such. It's still the T4 version which only knocks down on clean or CH (and
leaves you open to okizeme on block and even regular hit). This move is best
used after the b+1+2~2+4 throw since it's a guaranteed followup and does nice
damage (well, the u/f+2+4 is guaranteed too, but it doesn't do full damage if
they try to get up or move quickly - f,f+2+3 always does full damage and King
can get up faster after this move I believe).

As with the f,f+2+3, it's only viable in wall combos or guaranteed situations.
As far as I know, u/f+2+4 is guaranteed after a left side throw and b+1+2~2+4.
You can also use this (u/b+2+4 version) to escape away from some rare "deer in
the headlights unblockable coming your way" scenarios, but that looks kind of
stupid, and most of the time you could have done better things instead.

King's #2 mid. Short reach, but it has OK speed, great damage, and cannot be
punished at all. On front hit, the :1+2 (DDT) is always guaranteed. Useful in
oki to pickup (provided you're close to them) and juggle filler as well. You
can also do f+3 out of dash/CD to increase the range if needed. The DDT throw
leaves opponent face up, side towards King and if they try to get up quickly
you may get them BT'ed (either d+3+4,4,4 or d+3+4,2). A CH f+3 gives a heavy
stun in which they cannot duck under high moves for a while, nor interrupt,
but the free DDT is the jackpot.

Mid poke with good reach, much like Yoshi's d/f+4, tracks SSR. CH d/f+3,4 is a
natural combo, but if d/f+3 was blocked, you can be jabbed between the kicks.
d/f+3 alone is safe for poking, whereas d/f+3,4 is good to kill SSR moves or
if used sparingly (say, if they try to rush with slow stuff after blocking the
first kick).

King's new low, it has fairly long range, crushes highs and juggles on CH. The
small advantage you get on regular hit makes it a setup for FC/WS. However, it
is very possible to parry it on reaction. Best used on anticipation of most
highs (you should have +frames to start with if used up close).

depends on your opponent's stuff). Retaliation of choice after push-away moves
like Paul's deathfist, Hei's f,f+2 or blonde bomb. Handy whiff punisher since
it sends them flying across the screen on hit, usually for a wall splat.

d/b+4 on standing opponents, hits mid, jumps over lows for a reliable hit and
keeps King safe on block due to guard break. Nice low risk oki move.

Part of BT mixups after a successful QCB+1+2 throw (guaranteed if the QCB+1+2
landed on a big), and followup to f+1+2 on ocassions. Unsafe on block, but can
now hurt a lot on CH (dash deep enough to get the f,f+3 pickup). The stunner
afterwards is optional; if the BT 3 front hits, it's guaranteed, but you must
leave it out if you want the CH crumple stun for more damage.

King's "magic 4". Although practically replaced by b+1 for purposes of quick
CH hunter, it's worth noting that 4 is much harder to punish on whiff, and it
always juggles on a CH even if the opponent was side/backturned (CH b+1 only
stuns on a FRONT counter hit). The 4 also tracks better to King's right.

Yet another mid kick. Despite the looks, its range isn't as hot, this reaches
about as far as the standard 4. It crushes lows (not the low jabs, these will
juggle you out of it) and tracks to King's left side. It's much like SS+2 in
that it causes small stagger on hit, and if blocked you're barely safe (is jab
punishable when blocked near walls). This is one of those moves which can be
either good or bad, depending on who your opponent is: the "not-so-long-as-it-
looks" reach and hitbox detection issues are pretty annoying, and there are 
several moves that could travel under it somehow. Main use of this is for a 
close range mid instead of d/f+1>2 if your opponent likes to hit you low.

You'll probably use this more now that d+4 has been weakened in recovery since
this move is King's only safe, quick low poke. It still lacks range (in fact,
its range is shorter than his generic d+4) so make sure you're pretty close to
them before trying. Can be a bait for both of King's reversals against some WS
trigger-happy players if blocked. It's also a quick ground hit against the big
characters.

Low Dropkick                    d/b+4           L                SLD

Low dropkick. Slower than d/b+3, but much safer on block or whiff, since you
are grounded. A smart opponent can easily low parry d/b+4 and launch, though. 
Thing is, it crushes low moves and can avoid highs at the end. Actually, it's
an exceptional low crush move, because it hits low and ground, thus no matter
how low does their move crouch, King will always hit them. Plus, an u/f+3 is
guaranteed afterwards for decent combined damage. You can rely on this move to
crush other low attacks with outstanding TC property, such as Feng's SS+4, or 
Xiaoyu's SS+3, which tend to go under a lot of other low crushes like f+4 or 
u/f+4. Also, another use for d/b+4 is as tech catcher after juggles ending in
d+3+4,2, like CH d/b+3, WS+4, d+3+4,2 for instance. If they techroll, it will
catch them for the free u/f+3, and if they stay there, you will probably nail
them grounded anyway. It doesn't do a heap of damage for a tech trap, but if
it misses, you're safe.

jabs on block, but it will lead to half (or near half) life juggles, so it's a
move you can't live without. Great punisher after SS'ing or blocking moves, if
the window is big enough.

Slower than u/f+4 but does more damage. It's another post low block launcher,
like FC,d/f+2, WS+1+2 and FC,d/f+1. This one gets you the most damage, but it
is unreliable when the opponent is left is some weird position (like Roger's
SS+4, Law's d/b+4 or Nina's d,d/f+4...you might use u/f,d+4 in that case).

TGF and notorious TC moves like Jack-5's d+1+2 tend to beat f,f+4. One good
thing about this move is that you can dash and delay the 4 a lot, and still
get the kick...but please don't have it blocked.

Probably King's equivalent of Mishimas' TGF. Can't be reversed, does a lot of
damage on clean hit, can duck under highs while in the CD and crushes lows by
the end. Tracks a bit to King's right, I believe. A powerful combo starter if 
you're near walls, however the risk factor if blocked is big.

when used in combination with multis and other CD moves. Plus, it can pickup
rolling opponents off ground. No bad things to say about iWS+4/CD~WS+4, except
maybe the fact it doesn't do heaps of damage (but then again it would be kind
of cheap if it did, think of a mid EWGF).

d+3+4 alone, as a ground hit, is worthless. Stick with u/f+3 for your default
okizeme move. d+3+4,2 is still useful as juggle ender and as a (crappy) pickup
tool in oki. WR+4 is an alright move in a running mixup, if used sparingly and
mixed with the mid WR+1+2 (doing WR+4,2 isn't really recommended at this point
unless the opponent was grounded and you know the WR+4 will pick up, or if you
are really, really sure the WR+4 will be a CH). On a side note, if you need a
quick ground hit on bigs, use of d+4_d/f+4_d+3 is viable.

Long range version of f,f+3+4 minus the advantage on block. Even though this
is fairly linear, it's sort of hard to SS this move because if they do, King
grazes their body and lands BEHIND them, and that guarantees a wakeup 4 kick

High SS power shot. Used at random times to hit SS'ers at mid range or just to
gamble for a hit. SS+2 and u/f+4 do better at SS punishment, this move is too
slow to be a real danger against them. It crushes lows, is safe on block, but
they really don't block it that often.

Right punch reversal & kick reversals, respectively. Very useful to neutralize
slow moves and non-jail strings. b+1+3 can also reverse some 1+2 punch moves
in the game (a detailed list is below). Don't use the :3+4 after a right kick
reversal: it's much better to mix up the actual ground throws so they don't
break them.

Taunting Dance          1+2+3+4       Allows a CH; moves will damage on guard
= Charging Dance        = ~1+2+3+4    for a short time

King's brand new supercharger animation in T5. Now, he dances (the same dance
he does in one of his victory poses) while glowing, but after a short while,
King is able to cancel it into any move, although the charge effect soon fades
away. If you press 1+2+3+4 (or just 1+2+3) again, King can't cancel, but he'll 
end charged for a longer time after the dance. So the cancellable dance works
more or less like a taunt, whereas the uncancellable one is actually the real
supercharger.

This might be pretty evil; the taunting dance might invite your opponents to
attack, but if you cancel into a quick move (namely b+1) you may score a CH.
Reversals here are good as well. On the other hand, a charging dance ensures 
the CH, otherwise throw them if they don't attack. Make no mistake, this is
really far from any kind of high-level strategy; but it's a resource you can
use if you are feeling "dry" or in need of fresh setups for damage. 

Nevertheless, this is also a double edged sword: if you do a charging dance,
you're vulnerable to eat CHs yourself. Despite that, King's charging dance is
heaps better than the generic supercharger, as the animation has him moving
off-axis and a rushing opponent may whiff if not careful about the tracking.
Remember that, since you can't block while supercharged, your only forms of
defense in this state are 1) reversal 2) low parry 3) sidestep and 4) crush.

Jaguar Steps (JGS)      3+4*         Same as above, but falldown after 6x

Decent to cover ground quickly, but King will get dizzy and fall after 6 spins
a la Yoshimitsu so use with wisdom. Even though 3+4 does have some low crush
frames, d/b+4, u/f+4 or u/f+1+2 are generally better options (mainly because
of their consistent low crush properties). Against a standing opponent, you're
quite vulnerable when doing this (especially if you go beyond the first spin),
so real application of JGS moves is fairly limited to tech traps after juggles
and the like.

Looks the same as f,f+2 but evades lows at certain frames in the middle of the
JGS animation. This move floors them on CH just as King's CH d/f+1 used to in 
previous games. Not that bad, but I myself would prefer f,f+2 rather than this
move (because I don't use JGS that much in the first place). On CH, you get a
free u/f+3 or free f+3 on Kuma (will pick him up if he moves).

Slow, high roundhouse kick whose properties resemble those of TTT Jun's f+3;
guard break, becomes unblockable after 3 spins. Very good on guard (+12 frames
where they can't duck any highs, just block them standing. They can duck grabs
though). The problem is that it's slow, and hits high. This can be used to hit
backrollers, but there are better moves to do the job.

If you have troubles trying to pull this out, the real notation for this move
is something like 3+4~D/F>4. Just make sure you press 3+4 and hold d/f right
after that. Anyway, it's much like JGS 4 except that it doesn't hit high, but
mid instead, and it doesn't get unblockable. This covers SS very well (as does
JGS 4), but it isn't as good as the former on block because they get at least
a free WS+4 up close (you might be safer if they block at the edge, but the
disadvantage is still there). As such, it's not extremely usable because of
the slow speed and recovery on block issues.

Unblockables!

Thanks to walls, this has an use again. Can be used after most wall splats on
big opponents. But it doesn't do very well outside of that. It might surprise
an opponent after a CH f+3 stun for the first time (after a CH f+3 stun, they
cannot interrupt it, nor move out of its way), but they will catch on quickly. 
Otherwise, it is a very slow, high unblockable that should be avoided.

I really can't think of a reasonable use for this. It comes out too slow for a
BT move. If I know I am BT'ed next to them and they're standing afraid of the
mid BT 3, I almost always use the BT 1+3 and BT 2+4 (turnaround basic grabs),
but not this move. Besides, if things were not bad enough, this move tends to
whiff if King is slightly off axis. Do yourself a favor, forget this move and
use the basic BT grabs.

It's just too slow (in fact much slower than TTT Armor King's version, which
was slow already) and noticeable to be used on a standing opponent. Perhaps a
bit more useful as an oki and anti-techroll move after certain juggles, and/or
with the help of walls (actually easier to land on the bigger characters). I
myself have *moderate* success catching with this after ending a juggle with
1+2,1 on bigs. If possible, stick with the version described right below.

Quick Burning Knuckle   u/b~u~u/f+1+2           [!]              KND

This is not an actual move, but a rare glitch discovered by accident. It looks
identical to u/f+1+2* and has exactly the same properties, but executes at a
much faster speed. Note that the command for this move may be rather obscure,
however it still is something along these lines. Now, what makes it a glitch
is the fact that if you screw the move's input, you get an uber-slow version
of u/f+1+2 instead (even if this "5x-slower" u/f+1+2 hits, the opponent has
enough time to stand up and kick King's ass while he's still recovering). My
theory is that somehow, the u/f+1+2 "trades speeds" with the u/f+1+2*, so that
u/f+1+2 becomes 88 frames (which is the amount of frames that u/f+1+2* takes
to hit), and the u/f+1+2* becomes 35 frames...Truth or not, this glitch will
need a good amount of practice to perfect, but it DOES have some real uses.

Quick Moonsault Body Press  BT 1+4              [!]              PLD

By far, the best of King's unblockables. Fairly fast (for an unblockable that
hits ground anyway), has a large hitbox which likes to hit even if they are
somewhat off-axis (as it happens after techrolls). This move connects a lot
if set up properly. It's a good choice to nail someone after a wall combo as
well. Can be used in techtraps by ending juggles with b+1, it hits for decent
damage. King will end up grounded face down, so a FCD 3 sweep afterwards might
be able to float opponents for a free FC,d/f+1 or any suitable juggle.


+--------------+
| Top 10 moves |
+--------------+

Decided to build this section to make clear where are the good moves, the ones
that make the core of his arsenal in high levels of play. I decided to leave
out the throws, which are good but breakable:

Best 10 moves:
--------------

b+1 - Very fast, long range considering how quick it is. Safe on block, half
life damage combos on CH.

f,f,N+1+2 - Very fast too, forces lockdown on block and hit, on CH free b+3 in
open fields, or uf+4 for better wall splats at the wall. Short range, but hits
mid.

d/f+1>2 - Still his best mid, although not as good as before.

2,1 - Now that other characters' jab strings (like Mishimas 1,1,2) are toned
down, it's probably one of the best jab moves in the game. Not the best, but
damn near there. Setup for a lot of stuff.

f+3:1+2 - Alright mid, short range, but semi fast, safe on block, and it deals
good damage plus oki.

u/f+4 - Sure, it has short range and it's jab punishable, we all know, but the
hopkick is fast enough, crushes lows and deals up to 70 damage juggles on hit. 
Also, it's almost always guaranteed after low parry.

SS+2 - Alright SS poke, mostly safe on block, gives advantage on hit.

WS+4/CD,WS+4 - Pretty fast mid, safe on block, decent range. Generic, but it's
probably the most damaging and the longest-reaching single hit generic WS+4 in
the game. Can be done out of CD.

WS+1+2/CD,WS+1+2 - Slow, not a lot of range, but 70+ damage juggles on hit and
safe on block. Use in combination with CD,WS+4 and CD multithrows and you have
an actual CD mixup.

u/f+3 - Oki move of choice, crushes lows, safe on block and even whiff, deals
decent damage.

Honorable mentions:
------------------
(other candidates for top 10, but for some reason didn't get there)

1 - simple left jab, 9 frames +2 on block, can setup lots of things. Didn't go
into the top 10 because it doesn't do a lot of damage, and 1,2 overall isn't
as good as 2,1 is. Still very good as it gives advantage on block.

1,2>1 - nice for pressure with the last delayed 1 for a possible CH and free
2,1, however it leaves you at negative frames on block even though it's still
very safe.

f+4 (5.1) - mostly safe mid, crushes lows, good damage on CH/wall splat, and
tracks SSR decently. Didn't go into the top 10 because it's not as fast and
damaging as d/f+1,2 or f+3:1+2 on regular hit.

d/f+3 - fast mid, safe on block, tracks SSR decently and that's what it's good
for, however it does pretty weak damage unless you use the unsafer d/f+3,4 and
hope the d/f+3 counterhits.

d+1,N+2 - quick TC move to beat 8 frame jabs and such, but zero range.

1+2,1 - doesn't require directions to input so it's good after SS. Deals good
damage by itself, half life on wall splat, decent punisher (after SS). It did
not go in the top 10 as it's unsafe on block (very unsafe against a select few
characters).

f+1+2 - high, slow, but long range, good damage on hit plus oki, and safe on
block. This doesn't telegraph at all unlike f,f moves, but it isn't as fast as
it looks.

CD+1+2 - the CH launcher of death, surprisingly fast, can evade highs (thanks
to the CD) and has good priority. Also does fairly well in oki, but hideously
unsafe on block.

u/f+1+2 - another juggle starter, horribly slow and linear, can be juggled out
of, but does lockdown on block, high damage by itself (80% life on CH), long
range and crushes lows very well, too.

f+1+4 - lockdown on hit AND block, short range and a bit slow though.

f+2+3 - long range, good damage (even more on wall splat), but pretty slow,
linear and barely unsafe on block.

FC,d/f+2 - another mid launcher, 80 dmg combos on hit, fair range, but pretty
bad on block and also kinda hard to pull out.

b+3 - faster than f+1+2 and long range as well, but it's punishable on block
(depends on matchup though) and weak damage unless on wall splat. As a whiff
punisher, b+3 is actually more useful near the wall, whereas f+1+2 is probably
better in open fields.

u/f,N+4_u/f,d+4 - like u/f+4, but way more damage at the cost of being slower.
u/f,d+4 kills lows as well as u/f+1+2 does, but leads to more damage on normal
hit and can be used more up close unlike u/f+1+2, again at the cost of being
punishable on block.

d/f+4 - alright low poke, +2 on hit but has virtually no range whatsoever.

d/b+3 - long range low, weak advantage on hit, juggles on CH but can be seen
by good players. Best used as high crush at mid range.

More stuff only good depending on circumstance:
----------------------------------------------

u/b+1 - slow SS evading high move, anti-SSL useful against Baek's triple SS

FC,d/f+1 - slow low hitting launcher, can be used to evade highs

f,f+2+3 - not that good to tech catch but can do the job, better to use this
after wall splat or in oki, as it leaves you very vulnerable on ground.

u/f+2+4 - only really good after the b+1+2~2+4 throw or left sidethrow.

BT 1+4 - good as tech catch or in oki when you're BT'ed

f+2,2[,2] - juggle filler/ender; f+2,2 is also useful to punish when out of 
u/f+4 range

BT 3 - Self-defense move if you're being attacked from behind, fast and can
stun on CH but recovers horribly slow on block, it's also followup to f+1+2 or
QCB+1+2 throw.

d/b+4 - good tech catch after d+3+4,2 in juggles, free u/f+3 if you hit 'em
standing, super low crush move. Not too good because it's pretty slow and can
be punished with ground hits on block.

d+3+4,2 - juggle ender, crappy pickup tool

d+3+4,4,4 - only good if your opponent was backturned for some reason, as they
are all guaranteed on someone's back and will knock King's opponent down.

SS+3+4 - high SS move, crushes lows, tons of damage but too slow.

Nearly or plain useless moves:
------------------------------

f,f+1 (overshadowed by f+1+2 for the most part. Move is serious candidate for
a major revamp for next Tekkens because there are better choices)

b+2 (low damage, too slow and doesn't hit)

b+2* (overshadowed by u/b+1, doesn't like to hit either)

f,f,N+2 (overshadowed by d/b+3)

WS+2 (overshadowed by FC,d/f+2, u/f+4 and WS+1+2; another candidate for major
revamps)

BT 1+2 (overshadowed by BT 1+3_2+4 - whiffs a lot if just a hair off-axis)

d/f+3+4 (slow, special mid, low damage even on throw = no reason to use it)

+--------------------+
| 5.0 -> 5.1 changes |
+--------------------+

The 5.1 changes didn't affect King as much as they did to other characters in
the game, you can almost say King is pretty much the same in both versions of
Tekken 5. Let's see the changes in depth:

System changes:

- Wall damage removed: Giant Swing and Mini Swing throws (along with a few
  other throws in the game) will do normal damage if the opponent hits a wall.
  Basically, the extra damage they took from a wall hit in 5.0 isn't there
  anymore, so GS/MS will do the same damage they normally do when they're not
  techrolled. Also b+1+2 won't hurt them at all anymore, but for both b+1+2
  and GS/MS the wall splat effect still gives free extra hits.

  Naturally, the damage for wall combos is decreased too. However wall damage
  wasn't too much (just 5 points or so) so not a big loss to cry about anyway.
  It's actually more of a positive change because OTHER characters lost their
  previously mad damage wall combos, so King can survive more against those
  characters should he eat the wall.

+/- Ground damage is decreased from 100% to 70%: In T5.1 if a character is hit 
  while grounded, it will take less damage than if hit by that same move when
  standing. As an example, King's u/f+3 used to cause 18 damage points, now it
  deals about 13. Or, King's d+3+4 which did 10 points (if you didn't do more
  kicks afterwards) in 5.0, now in 5.1 it only does 7 damage (weak, isn't it?)
  It may sound pretty bad, but it's a new system change which is affecting all
  characters in the whole, so King also gets to take less damage if hit by an
  enemy move while grounded. However, I think the ground throws are unaffected
  by this change. So if you get a good chance for a ground throw, do that!

+ "Mach Punch" knockdown backrollable: this kind of knockdown used to give
  guaranteed ground hits in Tekken 5.0, now you can tap ~b to backroll after
  the knockdown and therefore avoid those formerly guaranteed hits. For King,
  it means his CH b+2 has lost its previously guaranteed followups. However,
  the change doesn't hurt him that bad since his b+2 is slow, and therefore
  unlikely to hit on CH anyway; this change should be seen as a positive one
  for King instead, because *other* opponent's moves like Bryan's Mach Punch
  and Heihachi's CH 2~1 etc. lose their guaranteed followups, and now King 
  will take less damage if he gets hit by them.

- Less vulnerable frames in techroll: If an opponent does techroll after the
  knockdown, he/she can now block much earlier in the roll than possible in
  5.0. In other words, a tech trap (hitting a techrolling opponent) is now
  harder to get, and some of them are no longer possible. However, most of
  King's tech traps are unaffected by this, either because they still connect
  in the early frames of the animation, or in the case of the ones that make
  use of his 1+4, it's an unblockable, no matter how faster they can block 
  now, an unblockable is still going to hit anyway.

King specific changes:

- After d/b,f+2 throw, opponent's recovery is decreased: no guaranteed d+3+4
  afterwards anymore. One of the biggest setbacks for 5.1 King so far. Looks
  like Namco doesn't want King to have damaging single throws anymore, save
  maybe for GS into the wall.

- Giant Swing damage in multithrows has damage adjusted: Pretty much what I
  explained in the system changes. The GS/MS enders (from d+2+4 air multithrow
  and Cobra Clutch/Full Nelson multithrow starters) will do the same damage
  on a wall hit. Followups after wall splat are still there. Considering that
  even those multithrows are already hard to begin with, (save for the d+2+4)
  hard to get to the GS enders, and that extra wall damage wasn't that much,
  you can ignore this.

- d/f+1,2 - less pushback on block if 2 is not delayed: you must use the delay
  version at all times in order to be safe, otherwise they get jab punishment
  for free on guard. Just remember, the move still combos on slight delay, you
  don't delay the 2 for too long, train yourself into getting the right timing
  if necessary, not that hard to do. On the good side, it seems that you don't
  get as much pushback on hit either, so now you can take more advantage when
  d/f+1,2 hits.

- FC,d/f+2 damage decreased from 23 to 21: In 5.1 the combos starting with the
  FC,d/f+2 move will deal their 5.0 damage minus 2 points, not too much to cry
  about.

+ b+1+3 reversal can be done out of FC/WS position, damage now depends on the
  opponent's reversed move: Self-explanatory; now you can perform the b+1+3
  from crouch and King will do his right punch reversal, not the kick one. The
  b+2+4 is still there if you need to reverse kicks.

+ f+4 causes knockdown on normal hit, and crumple stun on CH: even with the
  notorious improvements on hit, the move isn't too good to begin with. The
  problem with the crappy hitbox are still there and unfixed, some moves like
  Xiaoyu's AOP stance and Mishima's TGF will still travel under it. A CH f+4
  only gives d+3+4,2 as juggle (if you land it near the wall) for a total of
  37 damage or so.

Unimportant note:
In CH d+3+4,4,4,4, the Frame Advantage on hit for the 3rd hit is +11, and the
Frame Advantage for the 5th hit is +15 (opponent completely unable to block
in both cases). If d+3+4 connects on normal hit, the advantage will remain as
stated in the table.

| King's strategies |
+-------------------+

Command throw buffers & setups
------------------------------

King has some low attacks, but none of them is particularly good. His d/b+3
and d/b+4 are both fairly slow and therefore, more useful to crush other moves
rather than beating their standing guard and forcing them to crouch. On the
other side, he has d/f+4 and generic d+4 which are fast, but they almost don't
do damage and have arguably short reach. Because of this, in high levels of
play, King's mixup on an idle, turtling opponent is purely a mid and command
throw mixup.

Throw buffers are actually a good part of King's game. Granted it's very risky
to attempt grabs at the risk of duck and WS launchers, throws are still one of
King's ways to deal high damage, specially on a passive opponent. However you
can also throw aggressive opponents out of their moves (as long as it's not a
high crush attack; throws are considered as highs in that aspect), because the
throws have been given above average priority in Tekken 5. So now, throwing is
fairly valid on both aggressive and passive opponents.

- Giant Swing:

This throw has crazy range and is very bufferable. You can buffer the GS off
so many moves. A basic buffer is

f+1, HCF+1 (or f,2, HCF+1)
A jab buffered into a GS. The essence is to "split" the Giant Swing command
into its two halves, the f and the HCF+1. That way, you have

f,N+2,1, HCF+1
Old school, this is the 2,1 into a GS (not a "combo" as in T3 but still works
as a buffer).

f+1+4, HCF+1
King's "chest bump" into the GS. Nice and safe.

f,SS, HCF+1
The SS into a GS.

f,f,HCF+1
Dash into GS. Very easy and important to King's GS/iSW mixup.

f,N,d,d/f, f,HCF+1
Crouch dash into a GS.

f,f,f,HCF+1
Run into GS.

Basically, any move with a forward input can buffer a GS.

f,f,f,HCF+1
f,f,HCF+1
f+1, HCF+1
f+2, HCF+1
f+3, HCF+1
f+1+4, HCF+1
f,f,N+1+2, HCF+1

You can make your own throw setups that way. A more complete list would be:

CD, GS
SS, GS
1_2, GS
1,2 hit, GS
2,1, GS
b+1 regular hit, GS
4 regular hit, GS
d+1_d+2 hit, GS
WS+1 hit, GS
WS+4, GS
f,f,N+1+2, GS
f+1+4, GS
f+2 hit, GS
f+2,2 hit, GS
d/f+1, GS
d/f+2, GS
u/b+1 (hit at wall), GS
f+4 (5.0 hit at wall), GS
SS+2 (hit at wall), GS
f+3 hit, GS
u/f+1+2 blocked, GS
f,f+3+4 blocked, GS
JGS 4 blocked, GS

For moves that don't have a forward input, like d/f+2, b+1 or SS+2, you don't
buffer the first f, instead of that you're tapping f when the move impacts
your opponent and then complete the throw's command as the animation finishes;
this is not buffering per se, and can be done with every move, not just grabs,
but when done correctly can be just as effective.

u/f+1+2 blocked, GS:
Easy, simply hit f when the move "hits", then input HCF+1 right after King
recovers from the move. The u/f+1+2, GS setup can be useful against the big
characters, as the move is too slow to hit them in the ground, so they usually
stand up and block it. Giving you a perfect chance for a throw.

f+1,2, GS:
If you want to buffer the throw out of f+1,2, you must keep holding forward
during the WHOLE animation of 1,2, so when the animation ends you can just
enter HCF+1. Therefore the actual input for this is F+1,2, HCF+1. I emphasize
to keep holding forward during 1,2, not only before the first jab comes out.

WS+4, GS:
The trick here is to input the WS+4 as WS,f+4. If you do this you just have to
enter HCF+1 afterwards. So if you do WS,f+4, HCF+1 this should come out smooth
and fluent. The downside of WS,f+4 is that it may take a few more frames than
WS+4, which is 11 frames flat. This also works with WS+1.

- Tombstone Piledriver:

Much like the GS, Tombstone can also be buffered. However, unlike GS, this
throw is not as bufferable because King doesn't have a move that is done with
the d/b diagonal and that leaves him standing, d/b+1, d/b+2 and d/b+3 will put
him into FC, so you're limited to the most basic form of buffering which is to
do d/b when the move impacts and then complete the command when the animation 
finishes, this way you can make it come out from some attacks.

d/b, SS, f+2
The SS into a TS.

u/f+1+2 blocked, TS:
Hit d/b when the move "hits" then f+2 after King's recovery.

Other moves that can setup a TS are:

1, TS
2, TS
2,1, TS
d/f+2, TS
WS+1, TS
SS+2, TS
f+1+4, TS

Another issue with the Tombstone is that it has a short range, much shorter
than that of GS, so you're looking for pokes that don't have a lot of pushback
because you're leaving yourself out of range to grab; otherwise, if a move has
pushback then it's best used when there's a wall behind your opponent, hence
for instance in the SS+2, TS setup, it's meant to work if the SS+2 hits when a
wall was behind your opp, or if the SS+2 is blocked and the opponent moves in,
either by dashing towards you, or by doing some slow attack that moves him 
forwards (many attacks do this).

FC Tombstone: You can make the TS come out of full crouch. The command is kind
of ugly as TS comes slowly, but you might find it useful, if you duck a high
or block a safe low.

FC,d/b,N (stand up), f+2.

- Shining Wizard:

This throw is harder to pull out in a fluent way, and it needs some distance
to execute. But it is extremely useful in a mixup with Giant Swing since the
Wizard is the only throw that can match GS's range and speed. Good setups for
Wizard are:

d/f+3 hit, iSW
WS+4 hit, iSW
f,f,N+1+2 hit or CH, iSW
f+1+4, iSW
u/b+1 hit, iSW
u/b+4, iSW
SS+2 hit, iSW
f+3 CH, iSW
(Tekken 5.0) f+4 hit, iSW

All of the above setups also work for GS, since you can buffer GS out of dash
and run. Buffering the GS outta dash/run is ESSENTIAL to keep alive the mixup
with iSW.

There is a big thread about the ways to pull out iSW (Instant Shining Wizard)
which can be found at www.tekkenzaibatsu.com forums. Check it out at the URL:

http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=72084

The iSW is one of those moves that require lots of practice, but once mastered
it can make you a better King player.

- Rock Bottom setups:

Rock Bottom is the only FC throw King can do, while this is true only on the
surface, it also means that it's one of the most escaped throws in the game.
Prevent this from happening by doing the basic WS+1+3 and WS+2+4 ocasionally.

d+1, RB
d+2, RB
d/b+3 regular hit, RB
d+4 hit, RB
any opponent attack that leaves you in FC on block, RB

Hop into Rock Bottom: 
This is an old-school tactic still existent in T5. When your character lands
from a hop, it's in FC position right after landing for a few frames. Since 
your character is in FC, you can execute WS/FC moves including FC throws. The
notation goes like this:

u/f,(d~d/b),[d~d/b+1+2]

u/f is the hop.
The part between parenthesis is done in mid air, and the part between square
brackets is done right after landing. This means you can buffer the first half
of FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 while in mid air, and complete the command when landing.
Furthermore, in addition to making your throw more subtle, you can mix up with
mid moves like WS+4, WS+1+2 or u/f+4, or other throws (actually, you can do
this same hop buffer for Tombstone, but you need to wait until King stands so
it will take a couple of frames slower than RB).

The above tactic is more useful in okizeme, moreso right after some juggles,
since you are prone to be jabbed out of the hop if you attempt it on an idle
opponent. However in most okizeme situations they won't be able to jab or even
move around since they're rising from the knockdown, hence giving you the time
to hop safely into mixups.

- Low multithrow:

The d/f,d/f+(1+3_2+4) is bufferable as well. Not quite as useful as the other
throws, but for the sake of completeness I will add the buffers here.

d/f, SS, d/f+(1+3_2+4)
CD, f, d/f+(1+3_2+4)
d/f+1 (blocked), dash d/f+(1+3_2+4)
d/f generic low parry, d/f+(1+3_2+4)

Multithrows
-----------

OK, multithrows happen to be a part of King's movelist, and they shouldn't be 
ignored. Well, at least not the important ones. The multithrows you'll use the
most are CD+1+3 and CD+2+4, mostly because both are part of King's CD mixup.
Also because of the CD requirement (which makes you duck under the opponent's
high moves) depending on the opponent's actions, you might be able to land one
of them once in a while. As for the rest of multis in King's arsenal, QCF+1 is
basically worthless (because you can easily use a GS throw as replacement, GS
has only one chance to be escaped, and does more damage), the new JGS multi is
pretty hard to land (it might work if the opponent does some dumb low, but I'd
rather not count on that, because the actual risk of whiffing is usually HUGE)
and the SS one can be easily seen, and punished if you didn't avoid something
with the previous SS, it can be escaped like a sidethrow, and SS hopkick is
generally more rewarding. The d/f,d/f+(1+3_2+4) form is better because you can
use it after a low parry, but other than that, the CD+1+4 and CD+2+3 should be
the main ones to land.

So, now that you've landed the multi starter, you wonder what to do? OK, I've
received an e-mail from a player asking me how to do all these multis. So I
guess I should explain for the first-time players out there how does those
canned throws work. Let's make this clear via an hypothetical example:

Throw A
= Throw B
= Throw C
 = Throw D
 = Throw E
  = Throw F

You begin by landing the Throw A on your opponent. Then you can follow it up
with either Throw B, or Throw C. The first obvious thing here is that you MUST
follow the given path, e.g. you cannot do Throw B or Throw C if you didn't do
the Throw A first. The same goes for Throw D, Throw E and all links that come
afterwards, and (again quite obvious) this implies that your opponent must NOT
escape out of the Throw A because that would shut down the whole multithrow.
And if you're trying to get to the Throw F your opponent must eat all of the
other throws that come before F. Got it? That's the reason of the increasing
indents as the links go deeper. It means a sequence in which you cannot skip
to the step 3 if you didn't do step 2 first.

Now that you've landed the Throw A, there are three possible paths you can
follow afterwards:

- Throw A, Throw B
- Throw A, Throw C, Throw D
- Throw A, Throw C, Throw E, Throw F

To follow one of these paths, simply input the command the command for the
next throw (whether it is Throw B, or C) while King is doing the Throw A. The
next throw's input must be finished by the time the Throw A actually damages
your opponent, if you didn't complete it by the time the Throw A hurts him/her
King won't execute the next throw. If you did it correctly (and the opponent
doesn't escape) when he finishes Throw A he will do the next throw. If you did
Throw C, and you want to get to Throw D, then perform the Throw D's command
while King is doing the Throw C, and he will do Throw D after finishing the C,
and so on.

You'll notice that you may have a lot of time, or little time to input the
next throw in the path, depending solely in the current throw's animation. For
instance the Standing Heel Hold gives a long time to follow it up with either
the S.T.F, the Scorpion Death Lock or the Indian Death Lock, because the
animation for Standing Heel Hold (before the throw hurts your opponent) is
pretty long. On the other side, the Arm Breaker gives a much shorter time (but
still long enough) to follow with Triple Arm Breaker, Chicken Wing or the Head
Jammer.

The most important thing about multis is: MIX ALL THE PATHS UP. I emphazise to
not go for the longest or most damaging path all the time. If you do that, the
opponent will catch on to that quickly and will escape the next throw in that
path. So don't get blind by the potential 90 or 100+ dmg points you could deal
from a given path, because if your opponent is any good, chances are that he
knows already the escapes to that path, and WILL mash them if you try to get
him there. If you're aware of that as well, you know it's better to get 45-50
dmg than it is to have just 20-25 from the first throw, then see your opponent
escaping to his life. The only thing you can do about that, is to mix all the
paths and be as random as possible, don't be greedy here, if you have to give
up to the most damaging and coolest loking throws, give them up. It's the only
way you have to reduce their chances of escaping.

- Tips to enter multiple button sequences easier

If you're worried to have to enter many button presses in little time, here's
something that can help you to finish it quicker. Actually, you can buffer a
button by holding it down if you require that button to be pressed for the
next input in the sequence. This works most of the time, if that "next input"
is the last input for the throw. Again, let me illustrate with an example:

f,N,d,d/f+1+4
= 1+2,4,2+4

Here you have the commands for Arm Breaker and Head Jammer. If you grab your
opponent with the Arm Breaker and then want to follow with Head Jammer, you
can perform the Head Jammer's command as:

press 1+2, press 4, press 2+4

or alternatively, you can do:

press 1+2, press and hold 4, while holding 4 press 2

and the second form would get you the Head Jammer too. It helps to make it
simpler, right? Pressing 4, pressing 2+4 has the same effect that holding 4,
then pressing 2 as you're holding the 4! Thus you can buffer the 4 into the
2+4 easily. Here's another example:

f,N,d,d/f+2+3
= 1+2,3,1,1+3

If you want to do the Scorpion Death Lock you can do it as:

press 1+2, press 3, press 1, press 1+3,

OR

press 1+2, press 3, press and hold 1, while holding 1 press 3.

It doesn't matter which one you do, both inputs count as the same. Now, see
how button buffering is in action in a full multithrow here:

d/f,d/f+2+4 (on crouching opponent)
= 2,2,1+2

You know by now you can do press 2, press and hold 2, while holding 2 press 1,
right? OK, moving on from that.

= 2,2,1+2
 = 1,2,3+4

Of course, as you can see, there's nothing that can be buffered here; if you
do something like tap 1, tap and hold 2, while holding the 2 tap 3+4 you would
be actually entering 1,2,2+3+4 which doesn't match the command required to the
Powerbomb's command...

Not all of the links have commands to allow buffers, but those that won't let
you buffer buttons usually don't have a particularly hard button sequence to
input either, or at least not in this case...

 = 1,2,3+4
  = 3,1,2,3+4,1+2+3+4

Looks a bit more complicated, perhaps? But you can make it simpler:

tap 3, tap 1, tap 2, tap and hold 3+4, while holding 3+4 tap 1+2

You can buffer more than one button, you can buffer up to three buttons if you
have to enter all four buttons at once afterwards. If you have done the above
sequence as King does the Powerbomb, then he should finish the multi with the
Muscle Buster. It might still look a bit complicated to you, so if that's the
case, make sure you practice it enough before trying it in an actual match.
Only practice makes you better.

Here's an example of something that, even if can be fully recognized as button
buffering, it does NOT work in a multi:

f,N,d,d/f+1+4
= 1+2,4,2+4
 = 4,3,4,3+4,1+2

If you try the Arm Crucifixion as

tap 4, tap 3, tap and hold 4, while holding down 4 tap 3, tap 1+2

It doesn't work, why? Well, do you remember I said "if that "next input" is
the last input for the throw", right? In this case 3+4 is NOT the last input
for the throw. I don't know why, but if it's not the last input, the game just
ignores it.

f,N,d,d/f+1+4
= 2,1+2,1+2+3

tap and hold 2, while holding 2 tap and hold 1, while holding 1+2 tap 3

Here you can apply button buffering two times in a row, because this link has
such a command that allows you to do so. The logic behind it is that the 2 is
required for all the first, second and last inputs of its command, so you can
keep it held down the whole time. I don't know of other multithrow links that
allow you to do so, not for King at least. Also, for some weird reason, you
can enter it as 2,1,1+2+3 and it would still work.

Here's another example of button buffering that won't work:

f,N,d,d/f+1+4
= 2,1+2,1+2+3
 = 1+3,3+4,2+4,1+2,1+2+3

Tap 1+3 (hold the 3), while holding the 3 tap and hold the 4, while holding
4 release 3 and press 2...this would never work. The only buffer you can apply
here is tap and hold 1+2, then tap 3 for the two last inputs of the Rolling
Death Cradle (RDC for short) command. The RDC looks, and is complicated, there
is no other way to do it besides practicing it hard. Normally, to do RDC you
use the right index and thumb fingers for 1+3 and 2+4, and the right index and
middle fingers for 3+4 and 1+2. If you're playing the console version of T5,
you can use the controller's shoulder buttons (by binding them like, L1 as 1+2
and L2 as 3+4, and R1 as 1+3 and R2 as 2+4) to make RDC A LOT easier. The main
problem with shoulder buttons is that they're considered cheap so their use is
banned from many Tekken tournaments.

Since T4, it seems that you can actually mash all buttons in order to do some
of the throw links, even though this does work sometimes, you'd get the next
throw at random, and not always the one you desire. For instance if you do a
f,N,d,d/f+2+3 if you mash 1, 2 and 3 afterwards you might get either the STF,
the Scorpion or the Indian Death Lock at random. But I really avoid mashing
buttons for two reasons: one, the throw you get afterwards seems determined
by random, and two, mashing buttons generally damages the arcade or PS2 pad's
buttons. You don't want buttons that don't work, right? Do yourself a favor
and don't mash them.

- If your opponent tries to escape: Feinting/faking throw links

Eventually, if you use multithrows as an important part of your game, when
you get better and face the better competition too, you will probably find
some players who look at your hands when you're doing a multi. By know, most
of the better players know already the escapes for King's most common and
damaging paths. So if they look at your hands they get to know which link is
the next throw in the chain you were doing, and then will press the throw's
escape button. 

There are a few things you can do about that. The simplest one is to cover
your hand with the free one you have (during a multithrow, you don't have to
tap any direction on the joystick or pad at all, you only have to press the
buttons, so one of your hands - usually the left one - should be free to do
whatever you want with it), or your shoulder, or maybe the baseball cap you
wear, etc. Just cover the required hand so that they don't see which buttons
you're pressing.

Another possibility is to mash buttons at random, by doing this you would get
one of the following links at random, so neither you nor your opponent know
which link will be done, but as I've explained earlier, mashing randomly the
buttons really is not the best thing to do.

Another, more elaborated and fancier (but sometimes really effective) thing
you can do is to "feint" or "fake" some button press. When you're do a throw
link, the first correct input done before the current throw ends, is counted
as the next throw's input. Faking buttons is really useful in certain short
multithrows like the Standing Heel Hold, for instance:

f,N,d,d/f+2+3
= 1,2,3,1+2
= 1+2,3,1,1+3
= 1+2,1,3,1+2

1,2,3,1+2 is the input for the STF. The STF won't be done until that button
sequence in particular is inputted. This applies to every link of every
multithrow as well. But if you do:

= 1+2,1,2,3,1+2

You will still get the STF. The 1+2 at the beginning of the sequence is
ignored. You can do as much button presses as you want, the STF does not
come out unless the last thing you've done was 1,2,3,1+2.

In the case of 1+2,1,2,3,1+2 an opponent who was looking at your hands can be
easily fooled into thinking you've done the Indian Death Lock, whose command
is 1+2,1,3,1+2. As you can see, both inputs are very similar, except that in
the first case you've pressed a 2 in between the 1 and the 3...that little
detail does make a whole world of difference. The key here is to be as quick
as possible so that the opponent has little or no time to see the difference.
You know that jugglers don't really have magic, they only have really fast
hands, right? Make the hand faster than the eye.

But sometimes the opponents don't even have to look at your hands to tell what
buttons you're pressing, they will simply hear the sound of the buttons being
pressed. Again, faking buttons is an effective way to conceal the link you are
trying to do (the other is to get and use a silent custom stick but this would
be possible only if you're playing the PS2 version). For instance:

(opponent in midair) d+1+3 or d+2+4
= 1+2,1+2
= 2,1,3,4

One of the links sounds like two button presses, whereas the other one sounds
like four button presses, so if they hear from you four button presses, it's
fair to tell you've done 2,1,3,4 right? Maybe at first glance, but not really,
if you simply do Flap Jack as 1+2,1+2,1+2,1+2 or 2,1,1+2,1+2 or even something
like 3+4,4,1+2,1+2, it also sounds like four button presses...If you get used
to do Flap Jack this way, and you cover your hands as well, chances are this
time your opponent has frankly no idea on what you were doing, and has no way,
shape or form to know it altogether. 

OK, those are all ways to help you get more links and reduce their chance of
escaping out of them. But you also have the option of not finishing the multi
and just get two or three links done, too. How is that useful? Well, if your
opponent has little energy left, you would finish him with the next throw in
the path, but you can also stop there and kick him with a d+3+4 in the floor
or refloat him with f+3 and a juggle if he tries to get up. Generally, this is
the smartest thing to do, as your opponent could escape alive from the next
link and then comeback with a strong juggle or something. This - escaping from
apparent death to later rise as the fight's winner - happens a lot in Tekken,
more times than I could possibly remember.

Remember, the most important thing with multithrows is to mix all options up
and be as unpredictable as possible. The weaker throws are there for a reason,
so use them too. And if your opponent escapes out of any multithrow don't give
it up, sure it was pure random luck; he won't have such luck every time. Also,
remember that King has many other sources to deal good damage, not just the
multithrows - simply consider them only as part of your arsenal of moves.

The primary mixup
-----------------

King's primary mixup usually has him with the frame advantage (at least +5)
over his opponent, at range 0-1 (jab range). You want to keep him here, mixing
up mids and throws; grabs are so fast that they can't be ducked on reaction,
and fast mid attacks like d/f+1>2 need to be blocked standing. d/f+1>2 itself
is a good poke, but it's main purpose is to keep them standing with minimal
risk, if any at all. This is how King plays at high levels.

In a nutshell, King's primary mixup after +5 advantage:

b+1     - Beats jabs and all attacks that don't crush highs
d/f+1>2 - CANNOT BE CRUSHED, hits duckers, but may lose to 8-frame jabs
          Requires at least +7 frames to be uninterruptable
throws  - Defeat their standing guard, but can be crushed like all highs
          GS and iSW are for long range
          MB (QCB+1+2) and TS (d/b,f+2) can be used within short range
          Standard basic throws are OK.

Let's see a basic example off 2,1.

your 2,1 hits, you do:
- b+1 if opponent tries to jab you
- d/f+1>2 if opponent ducks or d+1 (or any high crush) anticipating b+1_throw
- throw if opponent keeps standing (most likely GS but you can use others too)

Primary mixup is 99.9% of the time available after:

1 or 2 hit
1,2 hit
2,1 hit
1,2,1 (if third hit connects)
d/f+1>2 hit
WS+1 hit (b+1 trades hit with 8-framers)
WS+4 close hit
b+1 regular hit
f+2 hit
f+2,2 hit
f+1+4 hit
f+3 hit
f,f,N+1+2 hit
JGS 2 hit
f,f+3+4 blocked (rare)
JGS 4 blocked (rare)

Aditionally, a good part of King's inside game comes from jabbing with 1,2.

your 1,2 hits:
- b+1 if opponent tries to jab you
- d/f+1>2 if opponent ducks or d+1 (or any high crush)
- throw if opponent keeps standing

Basically the same options after 2,1 huh? This is a basic example, but there
are more options if you look deeper (into the options off 1,2,1 string)

1,2,2+4
1,2, buffered GS
1,2, d/f+1>2 (preferably if 1,2 hits - if opponent ducks after it)
1,2>1 (if last hit is CH -> free 2,1)
1,2>1,2+4
1,2>1,1,2 (if they duck after 1,2>1 - riskiest option, jab punishable)
1,2, SS (evades 8-frame jab or basically any counterattack if 1,2 is blocked)

Side note, the first 5 hits of his tenstring (1,2>1,1,2 as I put there) can
be used to a little degree:

- Opponents cannot interrupt between hits (except for Yoshimitsu's 1+4)
- If they eat 3rd hit on CH, 4th and 5th hits are guaranteed
- 4th and 5th hits are jail - if they block the 4th, they cannot reverse/parry
  or duck under the 5th hit; if they eat 4th hit, 5th hit is guaranteed
- 5th hit is -11 on block, 0 on hit (according to last T4 frame data).

But generally you shouldn't go beyond 1,2,1. Both options are risky and the
third hit means disadvantage on block, so it's usually better to stop there.

Poking helps a lot to King's game. Generally, any poke can be a throw setup,
but there are few pokes that can setup ALL throws. Sometimes this doesn't only
sets up King's primary mixup, it can be good for other mids (e.g hopkick), but
these might be riskier.

Crouch Dash mixup (AKA Secondary mixup)
---------------------------------------

King has been blessed with a CD and some moves out of it. The CD allows you
to go under a high move safely and get stuff in their recovery - that's pretty
much CD's primary purpose. When facing pitbull-style characters, you'll learn
to move forward through CD, as it protects King from things like 1,2, enemy
grabs or those "magic" 4s. If they do - CD under their high, and punish!

Among default King's CD moves, you have:

CD+1+4 - Multithrow starter with 1 as break
CD+2+3 - Multithrow starter with 2 as break
CD+1+2 - The mid Black Bomb, semi-useful vs duckers, slow recovery
CD+4   - Mid Dark Knee (punishable - try to not use this one)

By entering any ub_u_uf+button move during your CD, you'll make that move come
out of King's CD in a fairly smooth way. This is possible because the upward
motions will cancel your crouch status whitout need to stand up. Which brings
us to:

CD,u/f+4   - Hopkick from CD, VERY useful vs duckers, decent interrupter
CD,u/f,N+4 - Delayed hopkick, slower execution but stronger damage
CD,u/f+1+2 - Capital punishment, jumps over lows, has long range and juggles
CD,u/f+3   - Falling wheel kick, hits ground
CD,u/b+1   - Water parting chop - small SSL evasion effect, tracks SSR

CD, f will cancel the CD into a f,f dash; you can then do any standing move or
throw. By doing f+button moves from crouch dash, you can perform a f,f style
move. If you don't have a f,f move using the X button, you'll do the f+X
button move instead. Note the brief pause between the CD itself and the f.

CD, f+1     - Jaguar Straight from CD
CD, f+2>1   - Rolling Elbow, Shadow Lariat combo from CD
CD, f,N+1+2 - Offensive push from CD; on CH free b+3 or 1+2,1 at the wall
CD, f+3:1+2 - Front Kick DDT from CD
CD, f+4     - Konvict Kick from CD

New to T5 King is the ability to perform the WS moves without using a b input
at the apex of the CD to get them. Now you're able to perform the WS move by
doing N (wait a split second without pressing/tapping directions) then press
the corresponding button(s) for that move. It's just like doing a CD,N+4,4
(CD Tsunami Kicks) with Mishimas (assuming you ever played them, heh)

CD,N+1   - CD into WS+1 basic uppercut
CD,N+2   - CD into WS+2 uppercut
CD,N+1+2 - CD into WS+1+2 European Uppercut
CD,N+3   - CD into WS+3 Rising high spin kick
CD,N+4   - CD into WS+4 Rising mid kick

So how do you use this?

While not being as effective as Mishimas, King's CD is useful on it's own way. 
For a start we have

CD+1+4
CD+2+3
CD,u/f+4

for confussion. Standing opponents will be thrown by the multi starters, and
CD,u/f+4 will hit the ducking ones for fair juggle damage and wakeup games. Of
course, many characters can punish you if they do guess right. The u/f+4 also
beats most moves if they try to interrupt the mixup.

CD,N+1+2
CD,u/f+4

European Uppercut is very useful to launch opponents after you successfully
duck their high attacks (Bryan's f,f+2, Hwoarang's 4,4 strings, Anna's QCF+1
elbow, you name them - CD under those, and punish). Same is true of u/f+4.

CD, f,N+1+2
CD, f+3(,1+2)
CD,N+4

More mids add spice to your guessing game. f,f,N+1+2 gives frames on block,
which is always good, and is less telegraphed when done out of CD. f+3's range
is in the short side, but comes out faster than other moves. WS+4 is quick,
safe and has good reach so it's probably King's best CD option by default.

CD,u/f+1+2
CD,u/f+3

These are sort of situation dependant. u/f+1+2 has pretty good reach, u/f+3
has unusual priority and hits ground. Both moves jump over lows nicely, and
are part of King's okizeme. I sometimes do CD,u/f+1+2 when I notice my opp has
a trend to interrupt CD mixups with d+1/d+2/d+4 or low pokes in general, and I
have been fairly successful at jumping over their lows and earning a good
u/f+1+2 juggle. The u/f+3 is a handy move against certain characters (Xiaoyu
and her whack AOP~d ducking, along with stupid PLD Leis come to mind)

CD, f, any move

Nice, by doing the CD alone you're not commiting into doing a move, and if
they try to interrupt your King stuff, you are free to react. Good moves here
are probably the b+1, the d/f+1>2 and a 1+2-break throw like the QCB+1+2.

You can make a CD mixup which emphazises on damage, or one that is safe.
For safety you can use:

CD,WS+4
CD,WS+1+2
CD+1+4/CD+2+3 (not really safe considering they can be ducked, but without
               them, there's no mixup)

King doesn't have the Mishima wavedash, but he DOES have the snakedash. If you
can snakedash with Mishimas, you can do the same with King, and if you can't,
practice.

f,N,d,d/f, f,SS, f,N,d,d/f, f,SS, f,N,d,d/f, f,SS...

Snakedash will bring SS evasion and SS moves into the equation, too.

Again, the fact you don't have the (E)WGF move doesn't mean you cannot mixup
like the Mishimas. I'm not saying you should try to go toe to toe with them,
'cause you CAN'T (E/WGF being a good reason), but maybe against non-Mishimas.
While a Mishima can wavedash and interrupt with E/WGF if opponents get cocky, 
King's CD mixups should be set up with intense poking game and the ocassional
advantage, either when opponent is grounded, or by backdashing out of an enemy
attack; that way opponents don't have time to interrupt the mixup.

FC mixup
--------

These are King's options out of the full crouch position:

FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2: The Rock Bottom throw
FC,d/b, stand up, f+2: The Tombstone done in an ugly way
WS+1+3/WS+2+4: Not so obvious, these are King's basic throws from FC. Another
way to execute these from crouch is simply FC,d/f+1+3 or FC,d/f+2+4.
FC+1,N+2: King's fastest move from full crouch
FC+3/FC+4: Generic low kicks from FC, common for most characters
WS+4: Basic rising mid kick, your safest bet from FC. Decent damage
WS+1+2: Slow mid launcher, short range, safe on block
FC,d/f+2: Another mid launcher, good reach but slow recovery
FC,d/f+1: The low leg breaker, goes under highs but has very slow startup
FC,u/f+4: You can hopkick from FC too.

Fine, King is not Bryan you might say, but he still has some very good moves
from FC including some launchers. I personally use those moves off FC -not too
hard to see why:

WS+1+2 (after ducking most highs, this is a good retaliation)
FC,d/f+2 (has longer range than WS+1+2)
WS+4 (if I want to get out of FC safely - sometimes this is all you can get)
FC+4 (low poke for tick damage, best mixed with WS+4)
FC+1,N+2 (if they want to poke King out of moves; it will stop highs cold)
WS+1+3 (mixed w/ Rock Bottom to prevent broken grabs; comes out just as fast)

b+1+2 followups
---------------

b+1+2 is one of King's best grabs once you have trapped them against the wall.
By mixing the b+1+2 alone, the b+1+2 linked to 1+3 and a mid move, you have a
pretty good guessing game. If there are no walls around, you can mix the 1+3
with the 2+4 links since a b+1+2~2+4 also gives you free followups, no walls
needed.

b+1+2 itself into the wall gives free b+3 for 21 damage and oki, although even
if they're at the wall, they can still break the throw.

b+1+2~1+3 gives King free stuff.

No walls behind them:

- f,b+1 (easy)
- f,f,N+1,2
- iSW (vs bigs) 

Walls behind them:

- free throw attempt including another b+1+2
- b+1 (fairly unreliable, sometimes goes through opponent for no reason)
- d/f+2 (wall splat? d+3+4 afterwards seems guaranteed.)
- 2,1

b+1+2~2+4 also has guaranteed followups:

FC,d/f+1
f,f+2+3
u/f+2+4 (do it as soon as possible)
run up, ground throw (do it fast)

Note that you get the b+1+2~2+4 followups only if the wall is NOT right behind 
King's back. In that case, you'll throw them into the wall and they'll recover
faster than normal for some reason, preventing any ground hit from happening.

b+1+2~3+4 gives a free ground throw mixup, or free d+1+2. However, it's the
most dangerous option from b+1+2 because, should they break your throw, they
will be rewarded with a free power move or launcher on your back.

b+1+2,1+2 mixups
----------------

As most people know by now, this throw will leave the opponent backturned and
right in front of King, at a small disadvantage (+5 frames for King). At this
point you can do d+2 (which is guaranteed) or stick with the mixups described
as follows:

- free d+2 : if you do this as soon as possible, they cannot turn around and
block the move in time, and if they attempt any BT move, then the d+2 will be
a CH. Only Xiaoyu in this situation could low parry your d+2 with her special
RDS low parry (then again you shouldn't be doing b+1+2,1+2 on her), but since
such option is unique to Xiaoyu, other characters can't do anything about it.
After hitting with d+2, it's possible that they still remain backturned; if it
happens, it's a guaranteed WS+4 before they can block again, but this WS+4 can 
be avoided if they do BT 1+3_2+4 right after the b+1+2,1+2 throw (they will 
turn around and the d+2 still hits them, but now they are facing forwards and
therefore they'll be able to block the WS+4 or whatever you may do)

- d/f+1,2 : the only way for them to avoid this is by doing a BT 1_2 or BT d+1
jab which will interrupt King if done correctly. Again they can attempt BT 1+3
or 2+4, but this won't do any good for them, since d/f+1,2 still connects on
their front as a natural combo.

- duck, then WS+1+2 : this is what you do if they try the aforementioned BT 1
or BT d+1 to jab you out of d/f+1,2. Basically, you duck and wait for their
move, so doing the WS+1+2 is actually optional and will most likely depend on
their response. The BT 1_2 is 8 frames, but has a much longer recovery than a
regular 8 frame jab from normal facing forward stance, so if you duck under it
you should have no problem in punishing with WS+1+2 afterwards. If they do a
BT d+1 low jab (which is low) or a low BT d+3_d+4 shin kick, you should be
able to low parry them and get a free u/f+4 juggle, and if they do BT u/f+4
(which is the only generic BT mid that could be a threat) they might very well
whiff because the BT hopkick has such a poor range and you practically have to
walk into it for them to really hit you.

Other less useful options at this point are:

- b,f+1+2 : It's quite rare to get a backthrow in this situation because most
players automatically duck when they get BT'ed, as no one in their right mind
would want to risk eating this. However, if for some reason the opponent is
dumb enough and holds back or forward to turn around, b,f+1+2 will connect as
long as it's done inmediately after b+1+2,1+2. The backthrow is actually your
most useless and riskiest option as it's very easy to duck and then punish
King's whiff with a generic BT u/f+4 afterwards.

- b+1+3_b+2+4 : Not as useless as the above, but perhaps just as risky. Some
players once getting BT'ed might try to mash BT moves as soon as possible in
the hopes of knocking King out of moves or a backthrow attempt. This is quite
stupid though, since he has the frame advantage for about +5 or so which is
more than enough to wait a split second and reverse them. Not bad, but it's
much better to just duck basic BT 1_2_3_4 and low parry possible lows like BT
d+1 or d+4, since you'll get a launch if they do any of these options, not to
mention that it's safer since ducking alone doesn't commit into whiffing moves
as you do when you attempt a reversal. BT u/f+4 is a mid but as I mentioned
earlier, it's very likely to whiff on crouching characters (specially if they
are crouchwalking backwards)

All of these b+1+2,1+2 mixups should be really avoided against:

Xiaoyu (she can parry from BT stance or even go to AOP and launch you, between
other options)
Raven (he has his Backbared punch reversal from BT, among other BT moves)
Lei (he can drop to the floor and you would whiff)
Nina (her BT 2,2,3 which is the same as her facing forward 1,2,3 could get you
into trouble)

If you can, use other options from b+1+2 (like b+1+2~1+3 or b+1+2~2+4) on the
above mentioned characters.

- against Steve:

Oddly enough, Steve doesn't have the BT u/f+4 which is available to all other
characters. This means you can actually attempt a backthrow with less risk of
being launched, unless he turns around while remaining in FC somehow, but I
don't think it can be done - AFAIK, if you attempt this you will stand up for
a brief period before crouching again, hence if Steve does this he probably
might eat the backthrow during that split second. I need to test and verify if
this is possible though. Irregardless of the above, he can still do BT d+1 to
crush a b,f+1+2 backthrow attempt.

Low parry followups
-------------------

Given that many sweeps will guarantee you a launcher on block, there are still
many "safe" lows that must be punished via low parry. Everyone's d+4 is a good
example. Now there's more of a window to punish a parried low punch (the frame
advantage seems to be +16 after parrying a low punch and +18 after a low kick)
Luckily, King has good punishment after a low parry, including a launcher.

King's possible followups after low parry are:

* u/f+4 to juggle
* f+3:1+2
* d/f+1,2
* after parried low kick: 1+2,1
  (good choice if opponent's back is next to walls; 1+2,1 (w!) f+2+3 68 dmg)
* low grab mixup: d+1+3 (break 1) d+2+4 (break 2)
* low multigrab mixup: (d/f),d/f+1+3 (break 1) (d/f),d/f+2+4 (break 2)
  Keep in mind that the first d/f is automatically buffered off low parry.

What to use is up to you. Needless to say the best option should be u/f+4 to
juggle, but sometimes you have to discard the hopkick, as it has short reach
and you are bound to whiff after parrying low kicks from some characters like
Feng (his SS+4 is a good example). You could solve this by realigning your
character with opponent (press ~f after parrying, then u/f+4), but this takes
practice and may still whiff on ocassion. In that case, moves like 1+2,1 seem
a better option afterwards.

Reversals
---------

A lot of people ignore completely King's reversals. They might seem somewhat
scrubby for some, or totally useless for others. But on the hands of a skilled
player, both of them can turn the tide of the match in King's favor. They do
good damage, they give you momentum to breath if you're under pressure, they 
give you free okizeme and they are totally unchickenable unlike the standard
reversals, so why ignore them?

If you really want to take advantage of King's unchickenable reversals to the
fullest, you must be able to see and read slow moves in the earlier frames of
their animation. For instance, lots of characters possess slow jumping u/f+4s
which recover safely on block, and as such they are fairly safe even on whiff,
a few examples being Bryan's (crushes lows very well, doesn't give frames on
block at all, it's hard to punish even on whiff and gives him crazy juggles),
Yoshi's, Christie's. These moves are good to crush lows, they are safe and 
unpunishable for the most part, BUT THEY ARE SLOW.

So what if that Bryan's u/f+4 juggles on hit and is safe on block? It's still
slow. Mind you, most of the good players can easily see a slow low sweep like
Jin's f,N,d,d/f+4 and low parry it everytime, guaranteed, because the move is
too slow for them and they can easily read it as if they were watching in slow
motion. If they can read Jin's sweep which does juggle on hit, who can say you
can't read Bryan's u/f+4 and reverse it?

Another common use of reversals is to cut down various strings (10-hit strings
come to mind) that have a break point in the middle of them, or most non-jail
strings (a jail string is a string in which you are forced to block all hits
if you blocked the first one). Things like, Kazuya's WS+1,2 where the second
hit is a right mid punch. True, you can get some jab punishment for free after
blocking the 2, however it's much better to see the 2 (and I mean see the 2,
because Kaz could easily stop at the WS+1 and you would whiff) and reverse it
for more damage and free oki.

Before attempting reversals however, make sure that you can see and read the
moves you're trying to reverse, otherwise your reversal attempt will whiff and
that could be the end of the round. Also, make sure that the reversal damage
is worth the effort, example: Law's d+2,3 you can reverse the 3 if you blocked
the d+2, but King can deal much more damage simply by blocking the 3 and doing
u/f+4 for a juggle, therefore the smartest option is just to wait for the 3 to
come out, block and then punish it. And, first of all, make sure that the move
you're trying to reverse CAN BE REVERSED! This sounds dead obvious, but it had
to be said; most (but not all) knee and elbow attacks along with a few select
punch and kick moves, like d+1 or WR+3, cannot be reversed; neither can be the
99% of throws in the game; so if you go around trying to catch the opponents'
moves, if they know this, they will give you what you deserve. 

Moral of the story: If a move is safe on block but is still pretty slow and/or
readable on execution you shouldn't leave it unpunished; no matter if it hits
low, high, middle or whatever. King has the standard low parry to counter lows
AND THE REVERSALS to counter most of what is high/mid except for left punches
and some unreversable moves.

Some obvious spots to reverse hits in strings are (in square brackets):

Anna's d/f+1,2,[3_4]
Hwoarang's d/f+3,[3_4]
Jin's 1,2,[3_4]
Kazuya/Devil Jin's WS+1,[2]
Paul's and Hei's d+1,[2]
Christie's b+4,[4]
Jack-5/Kuma's D/F+1,[2],1,[2]
Kuma's 1+2,[1+2],[1+2]
Law's 4,[u+3]
etc.

Okizeme
-------

Before I continue, there are some moves that still have guaranteed followups,
these are:

d/b+4 -> u/f+3
f,f+1 -> FC,d/f+3 or d+3+4
f+1+2 -> BT 3 or u/f+3_d/b+3_d/b+4_ground throw (depends on positioning)
f+1+2* -> d/b+3
b+2+4 reversals -> ground throws, u/f+3, FC,df+1
b+1+3 reversal -> d+3+4
b,f+1+2 backthrow -> u/f+3, dash ground throw
b+1+2~3+4 -> u/f+3, dash ground throw
b+1+2~2+4 -> f,f+2+3, u/f+2+4, FC,d/f+1 or u/b~u~u/f+1+2 if done ASAP
Left sidethrow -> same as above
Right sidethrow -> d/b+4, u/f+3, d+1+2
(on big characters) QCB+1+2 throw -> BT+3
(on big characters) left sidethrow -> u/f+1+2

Normally, King's options (in order of preference) when it comes to oki are:

* For backrollers:

- f,f+2~1 pickup: Works better up close. The reason this works on backrollers
  and it isn't a standard pickup, is the slow speed on the f,f+2. A plus is
  that if they stay down your f,f+2~1 whiffs but the 1 makes King "walk" over
  them, hence being safe even on whiff.

- u/f+1+2: Can work in almost any situation, even if you're in FC. Slow, but
  can jump over low sweeps. However wakeup mid kick (which can be done out of
  backroll) may beat it if you're not careful.

- f+2+3: Also good against backroll, but usually misses when your opponent 
  starts the backroll from a face down position. f+2+3 can also work if your
  opponent does sideroll into backroll, simply wait for their sideroll and
  chase them with a SS, then bust f+2+3 to nail them while backrolling.

- JGS 4/JGS d/f+4

* For people doing cross chop/hand spring/wakeup kicks:

- u/f+3 usually beats any wakeup kick, and crushes the KND d+3_4 "lightning"
  ankle kick.

- Black Bomb beats both wakeup kicks and hand spring for a CH juggle.

- For the cross chop they need to backroll or roll forwards first (it is also
  possible to do cross chop from face down/head towards but it requires roll
  forwards first), so you can do u/f+1+2, f,f+2~1, f+2+3 etc. as explained
  above against backrollers. Avoid using u/f+1+2 on people rolling forwards as
  King jumps over them and whiffs especially from close.

- For the wakeup kicks, you can also wait for them and parry the low sweep and
  ankle kicks or reverse the rising mid kick (King can also reverse the ankle
  kick despite the fact it is a low). Even if you don't feel like low parrying
  or reversing them (and I don't know why), you can punish them pretty bad on
  block; blocked low sweep/ankle kick is almost always a free WS+1+2, and the
  mid kick gives you free b+3/b+4/f+4 on block.

- For the b,b+3+4 (hand spring), u/f+3 from close or f,f+2+3 from a distance
  are fine choices because they will beat their handspring attempt, usually
  scoring a CH to boot.

* For siderollers:

- Ground throw mixup: Ground grabs can track siderolling opponents up close

- d+1+2: Sometimes it tracks a sideroll to King's left. Doesn't seem to work
  that reliable though.

- f,f+2+3: Can work from some distance.

- SS with them and d+3+4,2, u/f+3, f+2+3 etc.

* For people laying grounded:

- d+3 (on bigs): It comes fast enough. The chances of them escaping a hit are
  thin, if not zero. d+3 recovers OK afterwards, much faster than d+3+4.

- u/f+3: Solid and safe, even if they manage to stand up and block the kick.

- ground throw mixup (dash first if needed)

- f,f+2+3: Can be used if you are at some distance away from opponent.

- u/f+1+2 (on bigs): Usually too slow to score a hit. But it's safe if blocked

* For quickrisers:
- d/f+1,2/throw mixup
- f+3 or f,f+3 pickup (standard post f+3 juggles: f+3, 1, f+2,2,2 etc.)
- iWS+4 pickup (standard juggle: WS+4, d+3+4,2)
- d+3+4,2 pickup

* For techrollers:
- JGS 2 or f,f+2: not meant to hit the opponent but to put him under lockdown
  where you can pressure them. Additionally, you can mix JGS 2 with JGS 1+4
  or JGS 2+3 multithrow starters.
- 1+4 after specific juggles: See Tech traps.
- Tech traps: See Tech traps.

* Post throw okizeme:

Just as in Tekken 4, you don't have a lot of chances for free ground hits; a
lot of the time, it's more of a guessing game depending on your opponent's
position and what he/she does. To deal the most damage in wakeup games, you
need to know/guess how will they recover.

After most of King's throws the opponent is left in PLD position, or face up,
head towards King. This means he can get f+2+4 backthrow on people trying to
backroll. Otherwise you can mixup with d/f+1,2 if they quickrise, or standard
ground hit options if they choose to stay there. If they are big characters,
you can actually get a free d+4. These are:

1+3
2+4
1+3 airthrow
1,2>1,2+4 (opponent recovers VERY fast - d+4 not guaranteed on bigs)
d/b,f+2
Right punch reversal

Some other throws will leave them face up, their side towards King. In this
position you have the same guessing game of the previous case, but with the
advantage of earning a free df+4 (more damaging than d+4) on big characters.
These are:

(WR_f,f,f)+2+4
FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2
1,2,2+4
f+3,1+2
CH f,f+4
Standard 1+3 and 2+4 backthrows

There are a few throws that will leave them in standard knockdown position.
There is very little you can do after this, because the opponent can quickrise
and block almost instantaneously (in previous cases they might get hit in the
process). You get to treat them as if they were standing; it basically means
run up and mix d/f+1,2 with throws. Sometimes you might even get a CD mixup if
you are lucky. These are:

d/b+1+2 -> free d+4 on bigs
d/f+2+3
d+1+3 crouch throw

King's f+3 hits grounded Kuma & Panda face down. CH JGS 2, f+3 combos on them.

In any case, I want to stress that you do NOT want to use d+3+4 as the default
ground shot anymore; the risk of it being blocked by quickrise~d/b sometimes
is big, and the rewards on hit aren't that great...The only time you should be
doing d+3+4 is when you do d+3+4,2 as a juggle ender. If you want a safe
groundhitter, u/f+3 and d/b+4 are much better. u/f+3 is your best bet as it
hits mid (meaning they can't lowparry it as they can do with d/b+4) and beats
the rising mid kicks and sweeps from grounded positions most of the time.

Tracking stuff
--------------

For those who say King is a linear character. It's true: King doesn't kill a
sidestepping opponent like Hwoarang's RFF 3~4 does, but he can still stop
SSers.

Remember that a SSR here means the opponent is trying to SS to his right side
(King's left side). 

f+1+4 (tracks both sides) short range
b+1+2 (tracks both sides) short range
d/f+2 (tracks both sides) short range
[CD,]WS+1+2 (tracks both sides) ***
d/f+4 (tracks SSL) short range
f,f,N+1+2 (tracks SSL) short range
d/f+3[,4] (tracks SSR) short to mid range
d/b+3 (tracks SSR, not very reliable)
f+4 (tracks SSR, not very reliable)
f+1+2 (tracks SSR) long range
WS+3 (tracks SSR) handy from FC/CD, but risky if blocked or ducked
u/b+1 (tracks SSR) good range but risky on block, can be done from FC/CD
SSR+2 (tracks SSL) ***
standing 4 (tracks SSL)
CD+4 (tracks SSL? not confirmed)
JGS d/f+4 (tracks both sides - very slow)
JGS 4 (same as above)

If given the choice I'd recommend d/f+3 against SSR and basic 4 to stop SSL.
Additionally, f+4 and f+1+2 are good choices too. If you were crouchdashing,
WS+1+2 is a very good choice as it follows well both sides, plus is safe on
guard.

If your opponent tries to get your right by SSL'ing, then you are in a bit of
trouble because this is King's weakest side. Standing 4 does cover your right,
but it's a high and as such, can be ducked or crushed. It means you're going
to turtle more and try to catch him with a CH 4 or simply wait to see and
block his stuff.

+------------------------+
| T5 King Combos/Juggles |
+------------------------+

(w!): wall splat
GS: Giant Swing motion (f,HCF+1)
iSW: instant Shining Wizard motion (f,f,f+2+4)

All these combos have been found by the majority of the players in the TZ T5
King board (including me. :) Thanks to each one of them.

NOTES:

Damage for combos starting with FC,d/f+2 is valid only for Tekken 5.0, which
is the console version of the game. For Tekken 5.1 which most arcades have,
the FC,d/f+2 combos will deal 2 points less.

There are several combos ending with the d/b+(1+3_2+4), which is a breakable
ground throw. Despite this fact, the ground grab is still part of the combo,
because if the opponent breaks this ground throw, you get free f,f,f+2+4 (iSW)
on their back for a backthrow, or an easier-to-do b+3 for another wall splat.

Difficulty varies from 1 (very easy) to 3 (medium) to 5 (very hard). This is
based purely in my humble opinion, so it's a quite subjective issue. But I do
think that it gives a good idea on how difficult is the juggle to land.

In general, character sizes in Tekken 5 go as follows (from small to large):

- all female characters, Wang and Roger Jr.
- male characters (except Wang, King and bigs)
- King, Ganryu
- Kuma/Panda, Jack-5
- Marduk (he doesn't eat u/f+1+2 when grounded though)

The CH b+2* combos can be escaped by quick backroll (~b right after being hit)
in Tekken 5.1, and some of them can be avoided even with ~f in Tekken 5.0

Aside from the many character specific combos already listed, there are a few
juggles that will not work on some big characters (mainly Kuma/Panda - keep in
mind that the bears are not as easy to land juggles on as other characters):

- u/f+1+2, d/f+2, d/f+1,2, d+3+4,2 (on Marduk)
For some reason, this doesn't seem to work if the u/f+1+2 is a CH (but you can
still land any CH u/f+1+2, f+3, 1_2 juggle on him). Also, no matter if u/f+1+2
is a CH or not, the u/f+1+2, d/f+1,2, d+3+4,2 juggle doesn't work on him (the
2 in d/f+1,2 misses everytime)

- CH u/f+1+2, f+3, 1, ...
This doesn't work on Kuma/Panda (but you can still land CH u/f+1+2, d/f+1,2, 
d+3+4,2 instead against them)

- FC,d/f+2, f+3 ...
Doesn't work on Kuma/Panda and Jack-5 (you must use FC,d/f+2, f+1 instead). If
possible, use other launchers such as WS+1+2 against bigs

- CH d/b+3, WS+4 ...
Doesn't work on Jack-5 or Kuma/Panda; use CH d/b+3, FC+3+4,2 or CH d/b+3, 
FC+3+4,4,4 on them. Or better, use a ground throw mixup instead

The current King's staple juggles are:

- high launch, f+2,2, f+1, f,f,N+1, iSW
- low launch, f+3, 1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, iSW
- CH d/b+3, WS+4, d+3+4,2

High launchers are u/f+4 and u/f,N+4 hopkicks, WS+1+2 and CH f,N,d,d/f+1+2.

Low launchers are CH u/f+1+2, CH BT 3, and FC,d/f+2 (also FC,d/f+1, but you
must do a crouch cancel to hit f+3).

The CH d/b+3 one is pretty much the best you can do off this launcher in terms
of guaranteed juggles (you can also ground throw after CH d/b+3).

u/f+4, f+2,2, f+1, f,f,N+1, iSW - main staple for 66 dmg, works reliably on
all characters and from all high launches, you can add another f,f,N+1 jab for
extra 3 points before the iSW ender but that makes it even harder to land.

With King, you're bound to master those multiple dash jabs as well as the iSW
ender, simply because King's left jab is the best way he has to extend the
juggle, and the iSW (Running Powerbomb, max damage version) is his best combo
ender, it does the most damage, brings opponent close to walls and leaves you
in good position for okizeme. If you can't land the iSW yet, stick to the GS
command instead, but practice your iSW skills in the meanwhile so that you can
get the best damage from your launches.

u/f+4, 2,1, f+1+2, d+2+4 - decent choice if you can't hit iSW or GS reliably
yet, or just for some variation, looks nice and you can link into the Flapjack
or Mini Swing enders, which can be broken (but if you're successful at landing
the Flapjack, it raises to 68 dmg), or end there and go straight into wakeups
with an almost guaranteed d+3+4. The only drawback of this juggle is that you
can't land the f+1+2 on small characters or females.

CH d/b+3, FC,d/b+(1+3)_(2+4) - if you happen to have them trapped with their
back to a wall prior to the CH d/b+3 hit, then by all means go for the ground
throw, the attempt is completely guaranteed if timed properly (not that hard;
since you can execute ground throws from FC now, you don't need crouch cancel)
meaning they only have the option of breaking it, but even if they break, they
will be at the bad end of your free b+3 for a wall splat and probably another
ground throw attempt! If they break again reset the situation again until your
ground throw connects. Funny isn't it?

Other more conventional enders are:
f+1,2, b+3
f+1, 1+2,1

Other juggles are most likely started by other different launchers such as CH
b+1, CH d/b+3 or CH 4. CH b+1 allows a ton of different moves to hit which are
normally not guaranteed after other starters. A CH d/b+3 only allows for one
very specific followup (WS+4). CH 4 allows a few more juggles, but these are
harder to do (except for b+1, d+3+4,2). There's also a few u/f+4 juggles that
would fall within this class as they use other different followups (f+1+2,
f+1+4, etc), altough those juggles are meant more for style and flashiness
rather than the ones starting with f+2,2... and definitely not the ones you
would use in a world tournament.

There are some juggles which are A LOT easier if you hit the starter off-axis.
For example, CH 4, b+3 can only be done if you were a bit to their left (your
right) before hitting the CH 4. For the CH b+1, f,f+2,1 and CH b+1, f+1+2
combos, a small SS to the left before (or after) the CH b+1 makes the whole
combos possible.

A high wall splat (caused by a high launcher once it hits when their back is
to the wall) allows for pretty much every move to connect. The CD+4 (jumping
knee) causes a high wall splat, but since it recovers so slow you can't get a
whole lot of stuff. CD+4 really should be considered as causing a mid, or even
low wall splat even though technically is a high one. The CD+4, iSW requires
some distance between opponent and wall before the CD+4 connects so you can 
have enough space which is needed to pull out iSW.

As said before, f+2+3 is the most reliable followup after a wall stun. f,f+2,1
doesn't work all the time, seems to be angle reliant. Same goes for f+1+2* on
big characters.

If you cause a high wall splat, but you're not in the best angle to get a good
combo, most of the time you can SS and then get a standard juggle. For example
you can do: u/f+4 (w!), SSR f+3, 1, f+2,2,2. However, the camera angle might
confuse and screw you up sometimes.

| Tech traps |
+------------+

Basic tech traps:
-----------------

CH d/b+3, WS+4, d+3+4,2, u/f+3 (catches tech to King's left side)
CH d/b+3, WS+4, d+3+4,2, CD+1+2 (catches both sides - strict timing required)
CH d/b+3, WS+4, d+3+4,2, d/b+4 (free u/f+3 if d/b+4 lands on techrollers)
(after any small juggle ending with d+3+4,2), d/b+4 or u/f+3

launcher, f+2,2, d/f+1,2, f+2+3 (works better against bigs)
launcher, f+2,2, 2, b+4, BT+1+4
launcher, f+2,2, f+1,2, f,f+2+3 (doesn't work in 5.1 - can be avoided by roll
forwards or quick handspring, and it won't leave you with initiative at all, 
even if it lands)

1+4 Tech traps:
---------------
You can try 1+4 on techrolling opponents at the end of these sequences:

(escaped by either spring forward or quick roll back)

u/f+4, f+2,2, 1, f,f,N+1,2 - 43 dmg
u/f+4, 2, f+2,2, 1,2 - 45 dmg

CH b+1, SSR, f+3, 1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,2 - 43 dmg
CH b+1, f+2,2, 1, f,f,N+1,2 - 45 dmg
CH b+1, SSR, f+3, 2, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,2 - 45 dmg
CH b+1, f+1+2, f+3, 1, f,f,N+1,2 - 54 dmg
CH b+1, f,f+2,1, 1, f,f,N+1,2 - 54 dmg

FC,d/f+1, f,f+3, 1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,2 - 49 dmg

FC,d/f+2, f+3, 1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,2 - 51 dmg
FC,d/f+2, f+3, 2, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,2 - 53 dmg

(escaped by quick roll back only)

u/f+4, f+2,2, f+1,2 - 41 dmg*

CH b+1, SSR, f+3, 1, f,f,N+1,2 - 40 dmg
CH b+1, SSR, f+3, 2, f,f,N+1,2 - 42 dmg
CH b+1, f+2,2, f+1,2 - 43 dmg
CH b+1, f+1+2, f+3, 1 - 44 dmg
CH b+1, f,f+2,1, 1 - 44 dmg

FC,d/f+1, f,f+3, 1, f,f,N+1,2 - 46 dmg

FC,d/f+2, f+3, 1, f,f,N+1,2 - 48 dmg
FC,d/f+2, f+3, 2, f,f,N+1,2 - 50 dmg

*1+4 usually connects as a counter hit for the u/f+4 juggle

- 1+4 is 25 dmg on normal hit, usually 30 dmg on CH and 17 dmg if you hit them
  springing up. Add 1+4 dmg to the juggle dmg above.
- 1+4 might miss if u/f+4 connects at max range.
- if opponent techs to his left, 1+4 will hit him and will guarantee a rising
  3 for an additional 7 dmg or 10 dmg juggle starter.
- generally 1+4 catches techs for a maximum of 6 hits in a juggle, any juggle
  with more than 6 hits will cause the 1+4 to whiff

Missed f+1+2 tech trap setups:
------------------------------

- After a missed f+1+2 and they tech, you can buffer GS or TS or any grab that
  can be buffered from the f+1+2.

u/f+4, f+2,2, f+1,2, b+1, {f+1+2} - 47 dmg

| VS strats section (incomplete) |
+--------------------------------+

- VS Character Strategies

Excuse me if this section isn't complete yet, but I don't own the game, and
there are no T5 arcades in my city either, so I don't get to play it as much
as I want to (the only way I play is from time to time, mainly in some random
gathering with my comp and we rent a PS2 and the game. It's somewhat expensive
to play this way...) However, I don't want to leave any hole open. There ARE
some VS strats here and there, just not much. Most of this stuff comes from
what was said by people in TZ forums, credit is given to who is due.

For the punishment lists I will use the following format:

blocked enemy move = free King stuff

example: 1,2,4 = 1+2,1
means after blocking the opponent's 1,2,4 move, King has a guaranteed 1+2,1.

VS Kazuya
---------
Short punishing list:

1,1,2 = uf+4
1,2,4 = WS+4
df+1 = 2,1
df+1,f+2 = b+1
f,N,df+1 = df+1,2
f,N,df+1,3 = df+1,2
f,N,df+1,4 = WS+4
WS+1,2 = 2,1
df+2 (far block) = 2,1 (close) or b+1 (*)
b+2,4,1 = f+2,2 or df+1,2
f,f+2 = 2,1
f,N,d,df+2 (regular WGF) = 2,1
WS+2 = uf+4
f+1+2 = uf+4 (close) or df+1,2 (far)
f+1+2,f+2 = SSR 2nd hit then punish with uf+4
db+3 = uf+4 or FC,df+2
f,N,d,DF+4 = FC,df+2 or WS+1+2 or uf,N+4
df+4,4 = f+2,2 or df+1,2
b+4 = 2,1
WS+4,4 = f+2,2 or df+1,2

(*) : if you block df+2 at close range Kaz remains safe, you can tell if this
happens because a blocked df+2 at clean/close range gives a different 
animation on guard (Kaz's opponent kinda turns briefly to the side)

Strings:

- 1,2,2_4: after 1,2 you can duck, then punish the ducked 2 ender with WS+1+2
  or low parry the 4 for a free hopkick
- df+1,2_f+2_4: you can duck the 2 and 4 enders. The 4 doesn't juggle you if
  the previous df+1 didn't hit, so you can at least take the risk with b+1+3
  to reverse the other punch enders. (However, as general rule of thumb, you
  shouldn't reverse unless you can actually see what you're trying to reverse)
- CD+1,3_4: after CD+1, you can interrupt both enders with f+1 for a juggle.
  You can also interrupt both enders with a b+1, it will stun him out the 3,
  or float him out of the 4.
- WS+1,2: you can b+1+3 reverse the 2 on reaction.
- b+2,4,1: you can b+2+4 reverse the 4, or duck under the 4 for free uf+4.
- b+3,1,4,1: you can low parry the 4.

Kaz has returned as a powerful, yet risky character. When facing him, avoid to
make mistakes or whiffs, and don't be over-aggresive. Even if his options are
very unsafe for the most part, he still has good power to destroy anyone with
strong juggles. Luckily, you can punish almost every move of his stuff. Just
turtle safely and don't leave yourself open for EWGF, 1,1,2, or WS+1,2 etc. He
has such a lack of offensive power because his mids are either fast but pretty
punishable (WS+1,2, df+4,4, df+1,4, etc.) or really too slow to be used often
(f+2, f+4, db+2, etc). There are 2 exceptions here, one is df+2 which is safe
at close range but if blocked at mid to far range can be punished, the other
one is b+1 which is kind of a short mid poke, that gives him the advantage on
block and hit, and gives him free oki on CH, but doesn't have really that good 
range and isn't really that fast either.

His famous mixup of CD~WS+1,2/CD+4,1 (twin pistons and hellsweep) is back, but
you can punish both of those on block, also WS+1,2 has lost range compared to
previous incarnations. Most players try to use these mixed with EWGF, but this
time you can slash through those three moves (CD~WS+1,2, CD+4,1 and EWGF) at
short range with d+1,N+2 or d+2. This was impossible in TTT because EWGF was
able to interrupt even the faster d+1 with its very high priority, but now in
T5 the EWGF has been changed into a high move, and at the same time d+1 gained
high crush properties, so it will crush the EWGF and interrupt the other two
options at the same time. This is if you're in an idle position, where no one
has the advantage, but if you eat a jab or poke that gives him frames, you are
going to sit there and try to guess the mixup. Needless to say that it's still
better to keep blocking high because CD+4,1 doesn't hurt as much as a full 
WS+1,2 juggle.

Be careful of his b+4 up close (it's like King's b+1 but with less reach) and
his new FC throw (1+2 break). Practice and learn to see his lows on reaction
(db+4, db+3) when you're turtling, it might be key to victory. His hellsweep
is really impossible to see on reaction, but if you ever block one, make sure
you erase half of his life bar with a good FC,df+2 or uf,N+4 juggle. Take note
that out of all his lows, only db+3 (and generic d+4) has the ability to high
crush and go under a move, the CD+4,1 only evades highs if the CD motion goes
under a high, but the hellsweep in itself lacks the crush property, therefore
it can be interrupted even with jabs.

On the same subject, if Kazuya hits you with his db+4 low, don't press buttons
because he is actually setting up df+2 CH. If you block df+2 in this situation
he will be safe from jabs or whatever, so if you think he will df+2 after his
db+4 hits, remember your b+1+3 right punch reversal please, that's what it's
good for! Again, learn to spot and lowparry his db+4 on reaction (can be done)
so that you don't have to worry about this stupid CH df+2 bait.

Interrupt b+1+4 unblockable with df+1,2 (d+3+4,2 seems guaranteed afterwards)
Don't try to d+1 him out of it! It has little range and you might whiff.

Remember that Kaz is not as safe as he used to be anymore, he can still kill
you if you whiff a move (even if it's just a single poke) with his EWGF, but
his mixups are risky. Kaz needs you to whiff something for him to launch and
thrive, but if you manage to turtle carefully and punish his moves on block,
everything will be fine. If he is the one turtling, move in and do a little
"fake" offense - do whatever it takes to get him back into offensive mode -
then pull back and punish. I emphasize on not going over-agressive, as he has
the means to either CH you or make you whiff and kill you with HUGE combos.

- d+1,3: You can b+2+4 reverse 2nd hit if you blocked the 1st
- 2,2,1,2: You can b+1+3 reverse the last hit
- b+1,2,1: You can SSR the 2nd hit or SSL the 3rd hit for free uf+4
- b+2,3,4_d+4: Low parry the 2nd hit. If that fails, you can almost always
  visualize and read the d+4 ender, block and punish it accordingly.
- f,f+2,1,3: Duck 2nd hit and punish with uf+4, or b+2+4 reverse last hit
- df+3,3,3_4: Low parry 2nd hit. If he does df+3,3,3 if the 2nd hit connects
  you can still duck (not block) the 3rd, but you risk eating the mid 4 ender
  which launches. Do yourself a favor and low parry the 2nd hit ;)
- 4,u+3: you can SSR or b+2+4 reverse 2nd hit

Law belongs to the kind of "in-your-face" characters, simply because he barely
has any long range stuff. This means he won't be likely to play spacing, or
keep-away games or anything like that. He's in your grill, either pitbulling
you hoping to get a CH with moves like d+2,3, or turtling so that he can parry
the stuff you throw at him or punish it with a launcher.

His standard mid parry can go into DSS so he can get a free DSS 1, DSS 2 or
DSS 2+4 throw (break with 2) if he succesfully parries you (this is dependant
on the move he has parried). His b+1+2 (fake step) has been given the punch
parry property for the whole animation, and he can do most of his DSS moves
(specifically DSS 3+4 flying kick, it comes out quickly) out of it, so be
careful about rushing at him. He can do all of his DSS stuff after both DSS
and DFS stances (which look the same BTW), the b+1+2 fake step as well as his
moves that can shift into DSS/DFS automatically (his WS+3) or with b,f.

Furthermore, his moves with the ability of ending into DSS should be treated
with a little respect because he does automatically parry in the first frames
of the transition. These include the 1...2 punches, the 4,3 string, the b+1,2
(first 2 hits of dragon storm), the last hit of b+2,3,4, the SS+2,1,2,1, the
2,f+2,2, and the f,f+3, WS+3 and WS+4 kicks. Couple that with his 8 frame jabs
(CH uf+1 gives him a free 4,3), his 11-frame magic 4 as well as his staple
interrupters like d+2,3, d+4,3 and WS+4_df+4,3 and chances are, King will be
the one turtling in this particular matchup majority of the time.

The bad thing about turtling is, he will get the chance to go for his mixups.
Law's best mixup is the one that comes from FC, as he has FC,df,d,df+3 (low
slide) as well as his mid WS+2 launcher and WS+4,3 as interrupter. And he got
a lot of moves that put him on FC, like his f+1+2~D that gives him advantage
on block. If you ever get yourself caught in his FC guessing game, you should
block standing unless you can actually see his slide and block/parry it - the
WS+2 to huge juggle damage isn't worth taking. d+1,N+2 can SOMETIMES interrupt
him depending on his setup but don't ever get predictable with that, or you'll
eat low parry into hopkick juggle. His f+1+2 is probably more annoying than a
Bryan b+1, but you have two ways to deal with it, one is interrupting him with
a b+1, and the other is b+1+3 to reverse it when he becomes predictable.

The good thing is that a bloody lot of Law's stuff is punishable. For a start,
all of his flipkicks or moves that end in a flipkick are punishable (except
for 4,u+3), and most of them (except for UF+4) are punishable with a hopkick.
He doesn't seem to have any safe lows either, though King is unable to launch
him after blocking his db+3. Another good thing is, Law has huge, and I mean
HUGE problems trying to track. He has virtually nothing that tracks, except
for b+3 which isn't that fast. Sidestep a lot, and be ready for his b+3 every
now and then; with a bit of luck, you may even be able to reverse it for good
damage and wakeups.

Jack is back, and he's not a low tier anymore, so don't underestimate him. He
has a lot of new moves and many of his old ones have been redesigned. On that,
one of the first things that come to mind is df+2. Jack's df+2 does launch a
crouching opponent, unlike the other df+2's in the game, he also reaches A LOT
longer than other characters, but can be punished on block. He also got f,f+2
to punish big whiffs, it's in the slow side and is punishable too, but he will
dish out good damage from it. He also keeps most of his trademark moves, like
DF+1,2,1,2 (which can juggle on CH for massive damage), the f+1+2,2_1+2, the
b,db,d,df+1 (low) and b,db,d,df+2 (mid), the d+1+2 (risky for him, is slow and
punishable but is a great high crush and does TONS of damage), his db+1,1,1,2
string (of which the db+1 alone is an excellent low poke, giving him mixups on
hit). He has lots of sources for damage, has SS punishers (SS+2, SS+1, and the
SS+1+2 sometimes), safe power shots (f,f+1), and bunches of stuff that either
hit grounded and/or can be used for oki or wakeup purposes (db+4 as the quick
ground hit, df+1+2 or f,f+3 for the chronic sleepers, HCF+1 for pressure on a
rising opponent, the HCF~df+1 relaunch risers AND hits grounded, etc).

Among his new moves, is his new df+3+4 (it's a quick shoulder rush, that does
good damage on itself, and knocks down), it's pretty fast, but it's horrible
for him on block. He gained a new power low (db+2), a jumping move for the low
crush purposes (uf+2, gives him free d+2,1 on CH). He also keeps his EXCELLENT
throw arsenal with a new 1+3 that wall splats, two good single breaks in QCF+1
and QCB+2, the df,df+2+4 which juggles, uf+1+2 to megaton punch, the db,f+1+2
which can be buffered, and his db+2+3 which gives him a free df+3+4 for 60 and
possible wall splat. Be really careful about this one, especially if your back
is next to a wall as he can easily get db+2+3, df+3+4 to wall splat to another
df+3+4 for a total of over 100 dmg! Break it with 2. The uf+1+2,d,df+2 is also
dangerous at walls, but you can still block the megaton punch.

Jack does have his flaws though. He can poke to a degree, but his poking game
is still below many characters in the game, including King. For pokes you can
expect 2,1 (his fastest poke) which is a 10 frame right jab into a mid elbow.
When you block the 1 in this string, you can buffer a SS (to either side) and
you will automatically SS his next move. You can evade the 3rd hit of 2,1,2
that way, by buffering a SSR while blocking the 1, then punish the missed 3rd
hit with uf+4, but a wise Jack player won't do the last 2 because it's already
punishable on block. Still, if Jack uses 2,1 to pressure, you can quickly SS
his moves to the correct side as you block the 1. You can also SS his uppercut
rushes (DF+1,2,1,2, FC,DF+1,2,1, etc.), though you must do this manually, as
you can't buffer a SS in the middle of those strings. He also has b+1, which
is kinda like Kaz's b+1 but leaves him at small disadvantage on block and hit
and recovers crouching. On CH he gets free oki, though. His d+2,1 (low jab to
FC+1) is still there as a natural combo and crushes highs, you can low parry
the 2nd hit as always, or crush it with uf+4.

Overall you don't have much to worry if you're good reading animations, most
of his power moves are slow, or punishable (many of them give you launchers),
or both, and those moves that aren't won't hurt you that much. If Jack abuses
db+1, crush that with f+4 or uf+4. If he lands the db+1 it's a guessing game
for you, don't press buttons and keep standing, don't try to SS either (WS+1
launches and tracks pretty well), watch out for possible lows from FC, as in
earlier Tekkens you can read and block his FC,df+1+2 on reaction, but FC+1 is
a bit harder, luckily it doesn't do a ton of damage and you can still block
the next hit in the string. Also watch out for throws, specifically uf+1+2,
he can do it straight from FC, without crouch cancelling first.

Jack is generally vulnerable to SSR, many of his staple moves can be stepped
that way, the db+1 is hard to SSR but can be done, however f+1+2 tracks BOTH
sides nicely, make sure you punish that on block. King has the advantage in
speed, you can pressure Jack with jabs and b+1, however do not rely solely on
those moves; make sure you use a good amount of MIDS like f+3:1+2, d/f+2 and
d/f+1>2. Jack has lots of high crush moves, which will mean some pain if they
land, and a good part of his game comes from crouch as well. Dish out as many
mids as you need to interrupt his high crushes and keep him discouraged from
going into FC.

(from Lil Majin)

vs Jack, you have to be very quick to react and you must have your iSW combos
down packed if you want to keep him from abusing certain moves. You have to
remember that most of his moves are high crushes and that turtling against J5
gives him more options and allows him to take more risks. Basically, you have
to be in his face alot and at the same time turtle. You can't afford to eat a
CH DF+1,2,1,2 from Jack so don't abuse high strings. However, Jack cannot
afford to make mistakes against King either.

Here's a list of punishable Jack-5 moves.

Debugger -> free uf+1+2 or uf,N+4
d+2,1 -> free WS+4. You can also low parry the 1
db+2 -> free uf,N+4
df+2 -> free b+1
HCF,df+1 -> free b+3
f,f+2 -> free b+3
WS+1 -> free 2,1
WS+2 -> free 2,1
f+3+4 -> free 2,1
df+3+4 -> free f,f,uf+4
FC,df+1+2 -> free WS+1+2 or FC,df+2
d+1+2 -> free uf+4
db+1 -> free WS+4
db+4 -> free WS+4
df+1+2 -> free uf,N+4 (too much lag)

Btw, Jack-5's df+1,2,1,2 can be sidestepped in between hits, which is a lot
better than jabbing him out of it because you get a free uf+4 after SS'ing one
of them.

VS Baek
-------

If you are in need of a lifesaver against Baek's triple SSL, look no further
than u/b+1. It isn't that fast and hits high, but it's still low risk if used
correctly, Baek can't block or duck while he's in Flamingo stance, he could
crush it if he's good, but only his d/b+4 is a real menace in that aspect, and
that move is pretty slow and if you block it he's screwed.

VS Bryan
--------
Short punishing list:

1,2,3 = WS+4
1,4,3 = 2,1
SS+1 = 2,1
(QCF_WS)+1 = b+3
2,3 = 2,1
(QCF_WS)+2~b+1 = 2,1
(N_d)+1+2 = 2,1
3,2,1,2 = 2,1
3,2,1,4 = WS+4
df+3 = uf,N+4 (close) or FC,df+2
d+3,2 = 2,1
db+3 = WS+4

Bryan is good poker, his new 1,2>1 (8-frame) is beastly in which the last 1 is
delayable, is safe on block and stuns on CH so after blocking 1,2 don't rush.
His b+1 gives him +3 on guard so watch out and stay standing by default. Most
of his moves are safe and you won't see much openings, so make sure you punish
accordingly when you have the chance.

Stop abusing King's df+1>2 if you don't want to eat punch parry. Stick to fast
punches (jabs, d+1,N+2/d+2 and b+1) and do more kicks (f+3:1+2, df+3/df+3~4,
f+4, standing 4, uf+4, iWS+4 etc). As many players said, Bryan is mostly a
linear character and this is his weakness (he can counter SS with a few select
moves like df+4, f,f+4, WS+3, uf+4 etc...note that many of those are KICKS and
can be reversed as such). Also, King almost always has either free uf+4 or at
least 1+2,1 after SSing Bryan's stuff.

Luckily Bryan still lacks good lows, his df+3 is slow and his other lows like
d+3, d+4 or db+3 don't hurt too much (although db+3 gives him advantage on a
hit). Be careful about his f,f+1+2 throw. Overall, turtle with caution with
emphasis on SS.

(from Lil Majin)

"DO'S AND DON'TS VS BRYAN"

DO'S - Here are moves that you "do" versus Bryan because they are less risky:

f+3: safe on guard and good for SSL at times
f+1+2: kills Bryan's SSR and then b+1 combination
db+4: good high crush low attack and kills random mach punches. Relatively
safe on guard.
uf+4: only jab punishable
df+1,2: Bryan cannot punish.....good versus b+1's
df+2: Kills bryan's ss options
WS+1+2: Punish ducked throws and mach punches with this
F+1+2*: punish SSLed jab strings with this, then get your free db+4.

DON'TS - Here are moves that you "don't" do versus Bryan and here's why:

1+2,1: Bryan can punch parry the second hit, SSR the second hit and get a
free launcher, or guard the second hit and get a free f,b+2.
f,f+4: Bryan can punish with f,b+2 at almost any range and can punish with his
f,f+2 at any range.
CD+1+2: same as above.
d+3+4,2: f,b+2...nuff said
db+3: Bryan gets a free WS+1
FC,df+2: Bryan gets a free f,b+2

The best thing to do versus Bryan is to Sidestep to the left because he has
almost nothing that tracks to the left. SSL and then hopkick his arse.

(from TheDinosaur)

If he does b+1, you can SSWR his jabs or another b+1 or even throws and uf+4
him, if he tries something that tracks SSR you can almost always SS it left.
His uf+4 tracks SSR but it's not to hard to block (maybe even reverse) on
reaction. Your own b+1 is OK against Bryan as you get the CH juggle if he
b+1s, and a float if he uf+4s, plus it beats his safe mids, but take care you
don't try to go head to head with his magic 4, especially in a wall stage. NB:
as in Tag, if you block df+3 at maximum range, uf,N+4 will whiff, the best
100% guaranteed damage is FC,df+2

Anti-Nina
---------

(from Lil Majin, Howling, TheDinosaur and others)

You really have to turtle and know how to break her throws just because your
turtling makes you immune to throws. Other than that, be very patient and play
smart with few risks.

You have to sidestep when she tries to do repeated 1,2's and df+1,2's. d+1,N+2
stops strings b4 they start. 

- BUFFER THOSE CHICKENS IN YOUR MOVES (not your left punches; if she reverses
  those, then you must break with 2)
- Her weak side is her right so SSL+2, SW left is in order
- If she does df+1,2 (block) jab_df+1 you can beat both options with d+1,N+2.
  Don't do this often
- her best throw is 2+4 so break with 2 if you don't know. Her multi breaks
  are now just 1 or 2 (no 1+2 breaks except after her QCF+1+2), the 2 break
  usually avoids eating the most damage
- her uf+1+2 to the wall hurts, but you get a free rising sweep on her as she
  recovers slowly
- King can use lows a little more as she can't really punish and has poor
  reward off low parry (unless your back is next to a wall.)
- King's 1(block) 1,2 is UNINTERRUPTABLE so use that fact to your advantage
- f+2+3 kills sway/hayashida
- after d+4 is blocked, WS+1+2 will beat anything she might try (d+4,1 /
  d+4,1~SS+2 etc)
- learn to read her QCF mixups, DC is slow and SSable, d,df+4 is really slow
- Her u+4 is -10, so 1,2 throw or 2,1 throw are good
- uf+1 and 1+4 force you into crouch, but do not have frame advantage on block
  (1+4 is something like -5, uf+1 is less), mix up uninterruptable WS+4,
  WS+throw, any standard FC stuff etc.
- Her f+3 hits high twice, you can duck the 2nd hit on block of the first if
  you're good. if you block both hits instead, she will have advantage so stay
  standing (highs will hit if you duck), watch out for d+4 and throws

Anti-Anna (preliminary)
---------

King's db+3 crushes random QCF+1 attempts. CD in anticipation (to duck and
uf+4 or WS+1+2 when she whiffs over your head) is good too. Most of her lows
can be spotted except for df+4 (which can be punished with uf+4 anyway). Be
careful about CH d+3,2 (crushes highs) and throws. As with Nina, buffering
chicken in reversable moves is advised.

You can make use of King's CD+1+2 (Black Bomb) move because she can't punish
King with a launch. You can also abuse lows to a degree, Anna has troubles
punishing King's db+3 on block with a juggle because her WS+2 is too slow, 
but she can still low parry it and get an UF+4 flipkick launch.

Anti-Marduk (preliminary)
-----------

Tackle escapes have been changed. Now, it's either 1, 2, or nothing. Avoid to
leave yourself on ground too much (your uf+3 on block is fine, other moves are
not).

His VTS stance backdash seems vulnerable to King's f+2+3. I've had success in
the ocassions I tried it. If he abuses his 1+2 push, use King's b+1+3 reversal
(1+2 is seemingly abused when your back to the wall as it beats any move)

Anti-Paul
---------

(from MarkMan)

You CAN'T duck his f,f+2,1...if you tap D/B the moment you block the f,f+2,
then hold back, you will eliminate the mixup BTW. I don't think that was
mentioned anywhere before..

Anti-King
---------

f,f+4: Punish with 1+2,1
b+4: Punish with f+4
1+2,1: Punish with b+1
d+3+4,2: Punish with uf+4 juggle

The first thing you need to know is that 1,2,1,2_d+2 and 2,1,2_d+2 are not a
real mixup on the last hit. In both of those variants the last mid 2 is jail,
if you blocked the first few jabs you'll automatically block the 2 ender, no
matter what you do. In other words you can hold db to block the low d+2 ender
without the risk of being hit by the mid 2. That for a start, however smart
Steve players will shift into Flicker stance after the last 1 and then using
a mid from FLK. Be careful about that.

(from a TZ user that I can't remember)

df+2 hits him out of albatross spins, SS left kills his mixups

(from Tiger'sEye)

SW right is your friend. Seriously. When used at the right times it can dodge
some of his key moves like df+1,2, df+2 and 1,2,1.

d+1 cannot be crushed by your uf+4 (both will miss each other). It's better
NOT to anticipate and crush this move anyway because if you guess wrong and
he does 1,2 or df+1,2 instead you'll be floated and juggled to the wall. Just
crouch if you think he's gonna do it and WS+4 after blocking.

After getting hit by his WS+1,2 (which leaves you in FC), throw out WS+4 and
FC,df+1 every now and then to keep him on his toes. Your WS+4 can beat out a
lot of his moves that aren't jab speed, and FC,df+1 is high crush all the way
so it'll zip under his 1,2,1 if he tries it. Once you've got him to NOT attack
after the WS+1,2, you can start throwing out Shining Wizards and/or db+3.

WR+2 can be SW'ed right very easily if they get predictable. Most Steves like
throwing this out after 3+4,2. SW right and punish with 1+2,1 or hopkick.

3+4,2 and 3+4,d+2 mixups have to be dealt with the hard way i.e. just keep
playing until you're seasoned enough to see the difference. Or if you're
REALLY good, you can interrupt the spin with uf+4.

(Note: 3+4, d+2 is SLOW and with practice, it can be seen on reaction.)

The delayed Tombstone trick works well after blocking his db+2 or 3+4,d+2 i.e.
after blocking with db, return the joystick to N, then tap f+2. 9/10 Steve
players hold B when their low punch gets blocked.

If you duck his db+3,2, you have enough time to FC,df+2~juggle. KILL THE
BASTARD!


- King's Punishment Lists

If the above stuff didn't help you too much against some characters, here is
something else you can try. I have tried to make these lists as complete as
possible, but keep in mind most of those punishable moves are not obligatory
for most (if not all) characters, the staple moves of each character normally
are limited to a fraction of their respective movelists, but the intention I
am pursuing with this is that you have an idea on how to punish some moves in
particular that an opponent could use to screw you, even if they are not part
of the "staples". Do not try to memorize them all, it's not worth the effort,
just take care of their staple moves. If you find an opponent who is annoying
you with an unusual move, then you look for the stuff below. Also if you find
something incorrect, or something that you can punish on block with King and
is not already included here, please e-mail me about it.

As always, this is the format I used for these lists:

Character
---------
enemy blocked move = King's best guaranteed punishment

Of course, if a move is totally safe, or safe against King in particular, it
won't appear in the list.

What to do against some characters' strings is detailed after each list.

Notes:

- 2,1 can be replaced with f+1,2 in most cases, but note that 2,1 is still
  more reliable than the other move. f+1,2 is better for tracking purposes
  (like after blocking King's ub+1). 2,1 seems to have slightly better reach
  and gives King better positioning (easier to buffer most throws from it).
- f+4 can be replaced with b+3 in most cases (except when the enemy's move
  recovers crouching). b+3 has longer range though, so b+3 can reach where a
  f+4 cannot.
- Both WS+1+2 and uf,N+4 can be replaced with FC,df+2.
- WS+2 can be replaced with FC,df+2 too, if you're fast after blocking. The
  FC,df+2 seems that bit stricter in terms of execution, so let's say you are
  blocking a low of -15 that pushes far on block, you could reach with FC,df+2
  if you're good, but if your timing is off the move could get blocked, in 
  that case WS+2 is a lot easier to hit, but is less rewarding of course.
- uf+4 can be replaced with FC,df+2, if the enemy's blocked move is a low hit
  and you're fast enough.
- In order to punish the various characters' strings, in most cases you need
  to BLOCK the hits previous to the punishment point (example: "- f+3,3,4: 
  reverse the 3rd hit", it means you should have blocked f+3,3 before trying
  to reverse the 4), UNLESS INDICATED OTHERWISE

  the 3 if it's delayed

  df+3,2 or df+3,3 then you'll be forced to block standing. If she does df+3,4
  or df+3,1 you'll duck the next hit. If you see she goes into df+3,1,4,2 then
  inmediately crush with d+1,N+2 to stop the mind games at the end. Otherwise,
  just keep trying to duck after df+3,2.. or df+3,3.. as there are no mid hits
  in those strings, just high or low. Be warned though, she can SS into her SS
  moves directly after df+3,2. Also if you get hit by df+3,3,3, you can still
  duck the 1 or 4 at the end.

(*) : if you block df+2 at close range Kaz remains safe, you can tell if this

Strings:

- df+1,2_f+2_4: you can duck the 2 and 4 enders. The 4 doesn't juggle you if
  the previous df+1 didn't hit, so you can at least take the risk with b+1+3
  to reverse the other punch enders. (However, as general rule of thumb, you
  shouldn't reverse unless you can actually see what you're trying to reverse)
  IF you're really, really good, you can duck the 4 ender, then quickly stand
  up in order to block (and punish) the mid f+2.
- WS+1,2: Use b+1+3 to reverse the 2nd hit
- f,N,d,df+1,3_4: You can b+1 after the TGF, if he does 3 the b+1 will CH stun
  if he did the 4, the b+1 will float (do b+1, 1, f+2,2,2 or something)

  in mind that he can mixup with f+2,d+1 though.
- f,f+1,2: You can SSR the last hit then punish with uf+4, or interrupt the 2

- df+3 strings: after blocking the df+3, try to duck right away. If she does
  df+3,2 or df+3,3 then you'll be forced to block standing. If she does df+3,4
  or df+3,1 you'll duck the next hit. If you see she goes into df+3,1,2 then

- 4,3 strings: low parry the 2nd hit
- f+4,3+4_4: duck after 1st hit and punish with uf+4; you can also beat her

- uf+4,3,4: low parry the 2nd hit

  1,2 or 2,1, you can also b+1+3 reverse the mid 2 or block the 4. If d+1 hits
  you can interrupt both options with WS+4, and if d+1 is a CH you can still
  block the 4 (but the 2 becomes guaranteed) 
- 2,3_d+3: Duck after the 2 and punish the ducked 3 or blocked d+3 with the
  launcher of choice
- FC,df+2,1_2: you can SSL after the 1st hit then punish with uf+4. You can
  keep standing and block or parry the 2 on reaction always.
- f,f+2,1_:1_2: you can duck the :1, then stand up QUICKLY to block the mid 1
  (also known as "fuzzy guard"), you can also block/parry the 2 on reaction.
- f,f+3,4,4_f+4_d+4: You can SSL the 4 and df+4 enders (the d+4 will hit you
  out of the SSL, but it doesn't do real damage, and leaves Paul at BIG frame
  disadvantage), and then punish the whiffed kick with uf+4.
- QCB+3,2,1_2: Same procedure as with FC,df+2,1_2

"That's because King players r0xaaarrrr" - Solarin, TZ forums

Thanks to:

Namco - Tekken Tag was awesome, Tekken 4 was horrible, but Tekken 5.1 is
actually a good game. Let's hope they keep it the good way. Thanks for
reverting King into usable mode again... *razz*

Castel - for running his Tekken Zaibatsu site with pretty much everything
about the game.

People from Tekken Zaibatsu forums (T5 King board):

Lil Majin - for being such a great T5 King player, showing us (all the people
on the T5 King board at TZ) the combos, juggles, b+1+2~1+3 followups, some VS
strategies and such. Plus, he has proven that King ain't an easy match for
opponents in tournaments. Yeah even against 5.0 Nina whores!

Grim Walker - Helped me a bit with his insights in the move analysis.

MarkMan, -KDX-, flipster65, devildoll, APerfectCircle, Iz-Good, combot-killer,
Dangerous King, and all the guys at the T5 King board (whose nicknames escape
to my mind so please forgive me) for posting all their strats, juggles, and
whatnot.

Brahma - for telling that King can do f+2+3 backwards.

Howling - juggles, tips on making f,N,d,d/f+1+2 safer when blocked among other
things.

Tiger'sEye, RedKing - they came up with T5 King's frame data and info even
before the official sources were out. Tiger'sEye forged several frame traps
for the character and a small strat from CH f+3's stun.

RVD++ - for posting the complete T5 King's frame data table at TZ forums.

silencer017 - for his 1+4 tech traps and missed f+1+2 tech traps. Pretty good
stuff man!

PrepareforTrouble - I borrowed his "list of 1+2 moves that King can reverse"
which he posted at TZ forums.

Drake the Demon - for letting me using his King movelist as a base for mine.
Check his Tekken 5 movelists with Tekkenomics at the URL:
http://acmserver.cs.ucr.edu/~waltonk/tekkenomics/t5_movelists.html

The Tekkenfive.com site - for their T5 King combo vid, of which we got most of
its combos

Kungen, TheDinosaur, Snap - these people taught me how to play TTT King back
in the day; I borrowed more tactics and stuff from them than I can imagine.
