This FAQ is a Tekken 5 guide for Lei Wulong.  The purpose of this FAQ
is to provide you with info on Lei Wulong, and to let you know the
different techniques and strategies that I have learned and use.
There are different ways of using Lei, and this FAQ will mainly
cover the way that I use him.  I will provide a list of combos and
different strategies for Lei, among other things.

This FAQ covers the PS2 Tekken 5 (U.S. Version).  These combos and
strategies should work in the Arcade and other PS2 Versions of Tekken 5,
but I only tested these in the U.S. Version.  However, some things may
not work on Tekken 5.1, which is an updated version of Tekken 5 for the
arcade.

All combos in this FAQ were tested in the Tekken 5 Practice Mode.
They have been confirmed by me, so they should work.  However, not
all combos can be pulled off 100% of the time.

The "Character Strategy & Combos" Forums at Tekken Zaibatsu is also a
great place to find combos and strategies, but some of the threads can
be a pain to go through and read.

I have written four other General FAQs for Tekken 5.  This is my fifth
Tekken 5 FAQ, but my first Character FAQ, and most likely will be my
last.  I hope you enjoy it.

Lei Wulong is my main fighter, and has been since Tekken 3.  If you
ever play Tekken 5 in Southern California, I have a Lei IC Card
named "Get Leid".

This is a list of the notations that I will be using for this FAQ.  This
Legend is very similar to the one used by Tekken Zaibatsu, however are
a few differences.

Clean Hit
    Hitting your opponent from very close range.  Clean hits inflict
    more damage than a normal hit.  However, not all attacks will be
    able to become a clean hit.

Counter Hit
    Occurs when you hit an opponent that is getting ready to attack
    or is in the process of attacking.  Counter hits inflict more
    damage than a normal hit.

Ground roll
    To roll around while lying down on the ground (not instantly after
    hitting the ground like "tech roll").

Juggle
    An event that occurs when a character is thrusted into the air by an
    attack followed by a series of combos, punches or kicks while falling
    down to the ground. The juggling process stops once the character has
    hit the ground.

Launcher
    A move that makes it possible for your opponent to be juggled.
    (Also known as "Juggle Starter")

Okizeme (often called "oki")
    Japanese for "wake-up". In other words, the art of hitting someone on
    the ground or as they try to get up.

Tech roll
    To instantly roll away and then stand up the moment your body impacts
    the ground.

Whiff
    An attack that does not touch the opponent.  The attack misses the
    opponent completely.

Lei Wulong.
A Hong Kong police detective.
Lei became famous after breaking up the
Syndicate in the previous tournament.

Once home, Lei begins looking into who
is destroying dojos throughout China.

Many of Lei's close friends had been
attacked, so he had to do something.

He devoted himself to finding the person
responsible, but the suspect disappeared.

Lei hears of similar crimes in Japan.
The next likely target: The King of Iron
Fist Tournament 5. Now's his chance...

Lei automatically jumps over low and special mid attacks during Art of
Crane (also during Crane Step). Note that this will not cancel the stance.
He also auto blocks high and mid if you press (u_d) simultaneously with
the incoming attack.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This section covers a few of the basics of juggling, and some things
that you may find useful if new to juggling.

NOTE: This is a modified version of the "AOJ" that I added to my
      "Tekken 5 Combo FAQ", made to specifically fit Lei.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Basics
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  100% of health is about 145 health points.

2.  If the opponent can safely tech roll, then the combo is not a
    complete combo.  If the combo only seems to work if the opponent
    tech rolls, this is called a "tech trap", "tech catch", or
    "okizeme".

3.  You may be able to attack or juggle opponents if they attempt to
    tech roll.  This is harder to do in Tekken 5.1.

4.  There are a few combos that only work correctly if you are at the
    side, very close, or not too close to your opponent.

5.  Dashing (f,f,N) may make it possible to get in a few extra hits
    in a juggle.  Mostly, dashing will be used for jabs "f,f,N+1"
    and "f,f,N+2".

6.  For most fighters, a normal right jab does more damage than a
    normal left jab, but the right jab usually pushes the opponent
    back a little bit further away during the juggle.

7.  The Ki Charge (1+2+3+4) makes all attacks count as a counter hit
    for a short period of time.

8.  Some juggles may require for some of the attacks to not hit the
    opponent during the juggle or to launch the opponent.
    For example, with Lei:
    (f,N+3),4; f,f+3~b; BT,u/f+4; f+1,2; f+3
     = The "f,N+3" part of "f,N+3,4" must not hit

9.  For some fighters, doing "FC,d/f+3" or "FC,d/f+4" instead of "FC+3"
    or "FC+4" may allow you to get in another hit during some juggles,
    or allows you to hit a grounded opponent.

10. High attacks can be ducked.  Guard high to block (B).
    Mid attacks must be blocked.  Guard high to block (B).
    Low attacks can be jumped over.  Guard low to block (D/B).
    Special Mid attacks can be blocked either high or low (B _ D/B).



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Advanced Techniques
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  iWS (While Rising moves without crouching or jumping)

    Normally, WS moves can be executed using the following methods:
    1. You crouch down with (D _ D/F _ D/B), then release the button
       and when you are about to get back into standing position, you
       input (1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 1+2 _ 3+4) for the WS move.
    2. You use (u/f _ u _ u/b) to jump and input (1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 1+2 _ 3+4)
       for WS moves AFTER you have landed.

    However, there's a quicker way to do WS moves. You need to input
    d,(d/f_d/b),N+(any WS input). To make this easier, you can also do
    (qcf_qcb)+(any WS input), but only with certain characters, since
    many of them have regular qcf+(1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 1+2 _ 3+4) moves.

2.  CC (Crouch Cancel)

    After some moves, your character recovers in crouching (FC) position.
    A good example is Lei's "BT,d+4".  Since the sweep floats the opponent,
    Lei will want to use some juggles, but he's in FC, so he cannot really
    do any damaging moves to follow up...  Unless he quickly cancels the
    crouch and does normal moves.  To do that, he needs to press "u" right
    after the sweep animation is over. Doing this, he can do:
    {CL} BT,d+4; CC; SS+2~b; BT,D+1,1; BT,3

    Few more things to know about CC:
    - You can also use f,f to cancel crouch (maybe even b,b, but I'm unsure)
    - On paper, a CC takes 1 frame. but in reality, probably no one is able
      to do cc that fast.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Launcher / Combo Properties
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  Some launchers are only possible after a counter hit or clean
    hit, some launchers won't work if a counter hit occurs, and some
    launchers may let you get in a few extra hits during a counter hit.

2.  Some launchers or attacks are guaranteed after a low parry or after
    blocking certain low attacks.
    After a low parry, Lei can use "f,f+3" or "u/f+4", depending on the
    situation.
    * Info from TheDinosaur

3.  Some attacks have such a long recovery or execution time that
    will make you vulnerable to being juggled.

4.  Some launchers will not work on the opponent's side or back that
    would normally work from the opponent's front.

5.  Launching an opponent with their back or side facing you may require
    you to use a different juggle than you would normally use.

6.  Some launchers will not work when an opponent's back is turned,
    and some launchers are actually easier to get off in this situation.
    For example, Lei's "WS+2" doesn't require a counter hit on a
    back turned opponent.

7.  Even though it may not register as part of the combo, some attacks
    are guaranteed when an opponent is hit with certain attacks.  For
    example, Lei can do: CRA,2; BT,D+1,1; BT,3



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Universal Launchers
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  "BT,u/f+4" is a launcher that can be used by everyone except
    Steve.  This may come in handy if you ever end up with your back
    towards the opponent.

2.  "U/F,3" is a combo starter that stuns the opponent.  It can be
    used by everyone except Steve.  Damage isn't guaranteed if the
    opponent escapes the stun by holding "F".  To do this move, hold
    "U/F", then press "3" at the peak of the jump.

3.  "{CL} FUFT f,3" and "{CL} FDFT,f,3" are launchers for can be used by
    everyone.  "{CL} FDFT,f,3" recovers faster, and you can usually get
    a larger variety of combos from it.  These can be useful if you are
    on the ground and your opponent is close.  An example with Julia is:
    {CL} FUFT f,3; FC,d/f+4,3

4.  In addition to the grounded launchers described in #3, you can also
    perform launchers from the ground by connecting "3" on a clean
    hit in any grounded position, while you are stationary or rolling
    backwards.

5.  "{OBT} U/F,1" is a universal launcher that works on BT opponents.
    To do this move, hold "U/F", then press "1" on the way down from
    the peak of the jump.

6.  Every fighter has the ability to juggle an opponent that jumps
    in the air.  The most common way to begin the combo is by hitting
    the airborne opponent with a "1" or "2" jab.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Juggle Damage
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  The way that combo damage works is that the first hit counts
    as the normal 100%.  The second hit is reduced to 70% of
    its normal damage.  Every hit after that will be only 50%
    of its normal damage.  However, if you attack an opponent
    that is already airborne, damage begins at 70% instead of 100%.

2.  Counter hits can do up to 120% normal damage.
    Clean hits can do up to 150% normal damage.
    It is possible to get both a Clean and Counter Hit.

3.  More hits in a combo doesn't necessarily mean more damage.
    Take the following Lei combos for example:
    u/f+3+4; BT,3 (43)
    u/f+3+4; BT,d+1; BT,3 (43)
    This occurs because of "Juggle Damage #1".

4.  The order of attacks in a combo may change the amount of damage.
    For example, with Lei:
    d/f+2; f+1; f+2; f+3 (37)
    d/f+2; f+2; f+1; f+3 (38)
    This occurs because of "Juggle Damage #1".

5.  Damage after hitting a wall is reduced to 70% for all hits
    against the wall.  However, there are some special cases where
    the last hit of a combo against the wall will do 50% or 100%
    of the normal damage for that hit.  Also, the opponent hitting
    the wall does add extra damage to the combo.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Extra Damage
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  For some fighters, doing "f+1", "f+2", "f+3", or "f+4" instead
    of "1", "2", "3" or "4" will add extra damage to the juggle.
    For example, with Lei:
    d/f+2; 3 (31)
    d/f+2; f+3 (33)

2.  For the following basic attacks, Lei can add extra damage:

    Basic Left Punch (Extra Damage)
    ("1" = 5 dmg, "f+1" = 6 dmg)
         f+1

    Basic Left Kick (Extra Damage)
    ("3" = 28 dmg, "f+3" = 30 dmg)
         f+3

3.  Most extra damage attacks may also get you a little bit closer to
    the opponent than the normal version, but it also may take a few
    extra frames to execute these attacks.  Because of this, it may not
    always be possible to do the extra damage moves in juggles.

4.  Lei's "f+2 Left Punch" doesn't do more damage than his "2 Left
    Punch", but "f+2" does get you closer to the opponent while
    juggling than just pressing "2".

5.  If you connect an escapable stun on the opponent (see "Escapes &
    Recovery #1"), you may be able to do more damage if you attack
    immediately after stunning your opponent.  Immediate attacks may
    also launch the opponent higher.

6.  Even though it may not register as part of the combo, some attacks
    are guaranteed after a combo.  Sometimes, less damage is inflicted
    on an opponent that attempts to move.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Fighter Weight
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  The Tekken fighters can be split into three general weight groups:
    Big = Craig, Jack-5, Kuma, Panda, Jinpachi
    Small = All females (including Roger Jr.), except Panda
    Medium = Everyone else not listed above (including Eddy Gordo)

2.  Some combos may be difficult or not possible to do on certain
    fighter weight groups.  Some combos that work for one weight class
    may not work for another weight class.
    For example, this combo for Ganryu works only on small and
    medium opponents: WS+1+2; 1; 2,1; 1+2

3.  Adding more complexity to weight classes, some combos may only
    work for a specific fighter of a weight class.
    For example, the following combo for Ganryu seems to only work
    against Kuma/Panda, Roger Jr, and Wang if the opponent is launched
    from the front and from close up: d/f+2,(1),2; 2,1; 1+2

4.  There seems to be some special weight classes:
    - Ganryu and King seem to be between Big and Medium
    - King has really long legs, so some combos may only work for him.
    - Roger and Wang seem to be grouped together between Medium and Small.
    - Craig, Jack-5, Kuma/Panda have combos that only work spefically
      for them.  There is no simple distinction for the BIG class.

5.  Some grounded attacks will hit Kuma that won't hit any other fighter,
    like Lei's 3~4 or f,f+2 in the FDFA position.  There are a few attacks
    that will hit a grounded Marduk that won't hit normally, like Lei's d+3
    in the FDFA position.

6.  Feng and Raven seem a little shorter than the other male fighters.
    For example, I wasn't able to connect Christie's f,f+4,3; RLX,1,4,4,3+4
    combo on these two, but it does seem to work on everyone else, except
    Marduk.

7.  With all of the info above, I believe that the weight classes are:

    Big
        Craig, Jack-5, Jinpachi, Kuma/Panda

    Medium/Big
        Ganryu, King

    Medium
        Baek, Bruce, Bryan, Devil Jin, Eddy, Heihachi, Hwoarang, Jin
        Kazuya, Lee, Lei, Marshall, Mokujin, Paul, Steve, Yoshimitsu

    Medium / Short
        Feng Wei, Raven

    Small / Medium
        Roger Jr., Wang

    Small
        Anna, Asuka, Christie, Julia, Ling, Nina



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Natural Combos
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  Fighters can perform some combos from just doing one of their
    normal attacks.  This goes by the name "natural combo".
    For example, Lei can do: d/b+4,4

2.  Also under the name "natural combo", fighters have some attacks
    that can guarantee damage if the attack connects.  Some of these
    attacks require a counter hit (CH) for the damage to be guaranteed.
    For example, Lei can do: {CH} 3,3

3.  Many fighters are very vulnerable when their back is facing you.
    Some attacks are inescapable when hitting an opponent in this
    situation.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Wall Game
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  Tekken 5 doesn't have tech rolls for walls like Tekken 4, which
    opens up a lot of different wall combo possibilities.

2.  A wall might ruin the combo that you were planning on doing.  You
    will most likely have to adjust the combo, or stop it entirely, if
    your opponent hits a wall.

3.  Attacks that knock the opponent away and knocks them to the ground
    may also be used for starters of wall combos.

4.  Hitting an opponent near a wall (but not hitting the wall) may
    open up new combo possibilities that weren't possible before.
    For example, with Lei:
    b,b+1 {NEAR WALL}; d/f+1+2,[f] (45)
    
5.  Many attacks react differently depending on how far or close you
    are to the wall.  For example,  Lei's "Drunken Tiger Lash" (b,b+1)
    will cause an opponent to become stunned when hitting a wall
    from very close range.  However, from farther back, the opponent
    will immediately fall to the floor when hitting a wall.

6.  For practicing wall combos, the stages that I like to use
    are "Burning Temple" and "Poolside".



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Escapes & Recovery
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  You have a few ways of getting up quickly when hitting the ground:
    - Quick Roll (Background)
           KNDW (1 _ 2)
    - Quick Roll (Foreground)
           KNDW (3 _ 4)
    - Quick Roll Back
           KNDW B
    - Spring Forward
           KNDW F

2.  Some moves that stun the opponent can be escaped by holding "F"
    These moves are indicated in the "Combo List" section with an "*"
    next to the damage.  The damage is guaranteed only if the
    opponent doesn't escape the stun.

3.  Some moves that knock the opponent to the ground may create a combo
    opportunity, but the opponent can perform the "Spring Forward" by
    holding "F".  The damage is usually only guaranteed only if the
    opponent doesn't perform this move.
    For example, these attacks can be followed by a "Spring Board":
    Bryan's "f,f+2" and Feng Wei's "{CH} b+1"

4.  King's ground grab "d/b+(1+3 _ 2+4)" and throws following the
    crouching air grabs "d+(1+3 _ 2+4),(1+2,1+2 _ 2,1,3,4)" can be
    escaped, so the damage done by these are not guaranteed in juggles
    if an escape occurs.  The escapes are:

    Throw                Escape
    d+(1+3 _ 2+4)
      = 1+2,1+2            1
      = 2,1,3,4            2

5.  King's Giant Swing throw can be tech rolled to reduce the damage.
    The Giant swing used in juggles is performed by pressing:
    {Opponent in Air} d+2+4 * 2,1,3,4
    Upon hitting the ground, press any attack button.

6.  Most grabs can be escaped by pressing "1", "2" or "1+2".  However,
    back throws and regular air grabs cannot be escaped.  For info
    about throw escapes, check out the "Tekken 5 Move Lists", created
    by Drake the Demon, on the Tekkenomics Blog below:
    http://tekkenomics.wordpress.com/t5-move-lists/

7.  The "Grounded Ankle Kick" is a good move to perform if you're lying
    on the ground and your opponent is about to attack.  With this
    attack, you may be able to avoid your opponent's okizeme.
    Grounded Ankle Kick = FUFT,d+(3 _ 4)

8.  The "Recovery Auto-Guard" (FUFT,u,N) can be used to get out of
    some tech traps.  You will be able to guard high and mid attacks
    while standing up.  For example, you can guard Nina's "Leaping
    Axe Kick" (U/F+4) with this method.

9.  The "Ground roll" (GRND,1 or GRND,1,D) can avoid some attacks,
    but since you are moving around on the ground, you may be hit by
    some attacks that would not have hit you if you remained still.

10. You can block Jinpachi's "Super Stun" (b+1+2) by pressing either
    (d/b _ d _ d/f _ FC,d/f _ FC,D _ FC,d/b) right when he does his stun.
    Basically, you have to try to enter the FC position, or already be in
    that position.  Your player will shrug off the effects of the stun.
    Blocking the stun does seem to require exact timing, except when
    you're already in the full crouch position.  However, I don't know if
    there is a way to block after you have been stunned.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
              While Standing / While Rising Moves
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  There are many moves within the game that when performed, causes
    your fighter to enter a crouched position.  If you leave the
    controller neutral, you can perform any "WS" move.  There are also
    a few moves that also has this property if you block or are hit by
    your opponent's attack.

    An example can be seen with Lei:
    Right Punch Poke to While Rising
         d+2; WS (Any WS Move)

    More examples include:

    - Being hit with Steve's "Wildman" (WS+1,2) forces you to crouch.

    - Being hit by or blocking Marduk's "Dunk Elbow" (d+1) also forces
      you to crouch.

2.  There are other ways to go into "WS".  Most of these attacks are
    universal.  Here are a few:

    Grounded Ankle Kick to While Rising
         FUFT, d+(3 _ 4), WS (Any WS move)

    Jump to While Rising
         (u/f _ U/F _ U _ U/B), WS (Any WS move)

    Wake-up Low Kick to While Rising
         GRND, 3, WS (Any WS move)

    Wake-up Rolling Low Kick to While Rising
         GRND, (b _ f), 3, WS (Any WS move)

3.  There are some cases where you can just perform a Rising Kick.
    Most of these attacks are universal.  Some of those moves are:

    FDFA Rising Kick
    All except Steve
         FDFA, u, (Any WS Kick)

    Standing While Rising Kick
    All except Steve
         GRND, (b _ f) ** (Any WS Kick)



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Advice
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  Practice Mode is the best way to practice combos.  If you're not
    practicing wall combos, infinite stages are best, such as:
    Moonlit Wilderness, Polar Paradise, Final Stage, and Final Stage 2.
    During a match, it is best to perform the juggles that you have
    practiced.

2.  After learning a new juggle, practice playing against the computer
    in "Practice Mode" -> "VS CPU Training" so that you can get a feel
    of how to work the combo into your playing style.

3.  For a good all-around game, it is best to mix different launchers
    into a match.  Performing the same launcher may become predictable.
    Performing the same combo for a launcher is okay, because once
    the opponent is airborne, there is nothing they can do.

4.  The "Hit Analysis" option in Practice mode can be useful when
    practicing combos.  Brightness indicates that the fighter is able
    to block or attack.  Gray means that the fighter is unable to do
    anything.  A flash of brightness means that the fighter is able to
    escape or tech roll at that slight moment.

5.  Don't feel like you have to learn the difficult or most damaging
    combos for a fighter, because you don't.  Learn the combos that
    feel comfortable to you, and the ones that you will actually
    remember during gameplay.

6.  Watching other people play can be extremely helpful.  This has
    helped me to learn a lot of different combos and strategies.

7.  If there is a certain stance that you like to use, you might
    want to choose your combo based on what stance or position
    that you'll end up in.  Some optional stances are written
    within [ ] brackets at the end of a combo.

8.  Experiment and mix-up different combos.  Not all possible combos
    for each launcher is listed in this Combo FAQ.  Some combos can be
    interchanged with different launchers.  Also, there are some combos
    for launchers listed that can give even more damage.  You can check
    the "Character Strategy & Combos" Forums at Tekken Zaibatsu for
    more info:
    http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?forumid=61

9.  You might find it helpful to assign button combinations to the
    shoulder buttons on the controller.  I like to use the following
    configuration:
    L2 = LP+RP (1+2) or LP+LK (1+3)
    L1 = LK+RK (3+4) or RP+RK (2+4)
    R2 = LP+RK (1+4)
    R1 = RP+LK (2+3)

10. Pay close attention to the way that I write the combos.  It may
    help if you're having trouble performing the combos.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Other Stuff
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  If you are hit while doing an attack/launcher, but you are still
    standing, you may be able to get in some hits that you wouldn't
    have normally.

2.  The FDFA position is difficult to safely get up from.  So, if your
    opponent is ever in this position, you may be able to get in a
    grounded hit or a tech hit.  Be careful, because Craig, Kuma, and
    Lei can attack while in this position.

4.  It is important to not hold the buttons longer than you need to,
    because you might end up doing a move that wasn't what you were
    planning to do.

5.  Lei and Christie have a side-step motion in their fighting stance
    that may make it a little harder to get complete combos off on them.
    This is because you might launch them from their side instead of
    from their front.

6.  Some of Yoshimitsu's stances can be turned into a juggle by hitting
    him with a regular jab (or another attack) to start the juggle.
    This includes the "Flea" (1+2) and "Dragonfly" (u+1+2).



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Practice Mode Positions
-------------------------------------------------------------------


This section is to aid those who have problems getting their fighter
or their opponent in certain situations while practicing combos.


After Low Parry
---------------
One of the best methods to try out combos after a low parry is to go
to "Defensive Training" and have Bryan perform his "Snake Edge" (d/f+3).
You can also try out different low attacks, but the results may vary.


Counter Hit (CH)
----------------
Set the "Counter Hit" option to "ON", or you can either perform the
"Ki Charge" (1+2+3+4) every time.  Counter Hit on a back turned opponent
will only work in practice mode if you perform the Ki Charge. Otherwise,
you will make the opponent attempt to hit you.


BT Opponent (OBT)
-----------------
You can sidestep around you opponent until their back is towards you,
or you can select the opponent to be either Lei, Ling, or Raven, and
have them perform "b+3+4" under "Defensive Training".


Crouching Opponent (OCR)
------------------------
Set "Training Dummy" to "Crouch" or "Crouch Guard".


Grounded Opponent (OGR)
-----------------------
Knock the opponent to the ground, then set "Training Dummy" to "Controller".
This is the only way to make the opponent stay on the ground.


FUFT or FDFT
------------
FUFT = With Lei, do "4~4" or "BT,d+3+4"
FDFT = With Lei, do "BT,d+1+2"


Opponent in Air
---------------
You can go to "Defensive Training" and have the opponent do any jumping
attack, or have Yoshimitsu do "Flea" (1+2) or "Dragonfly" (u+1+2).



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Lei's Common Juggle Enders
-------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE: Not all juggle enders are possible for every launcher.



Normal Juggle Ender     Info / Comments
-------------------     ---------------

f+3                     Has decent range and damage, and can be used to end
                          many juggles.

f,f+3,4                 Usually gives you the most damage.  You should use
                          this if you can consistently connect both kicks.

d+4,[d]                 When doing this ender, I always go into the Snake
                          stance after.

d/f+1+2,[f]             You can usually get in "TGR,4" after this ender.

f,f+2                   Gets you close to the enemy when ending with this
                          attack. You might be able to connect "d+4,[d]"
                          afterwards if the opponent attempts to move on
                          the ground.

f,N+1,2,1,2,4,[u_d]     May be able to connect "CRA,4" if opponent doesn't
                          do a Quick Roll.

f,N+4~1,2,3             Decent. Can't do too much before ending with this.

f,N+4~1,2,2,2,[f]       Enter the Panther stance for okizeme possibilities.

4~4,3,3                 You might be able to get in "FDFT,3~4" after, if the
                          opponent doesn't get up right away.

FC+4~4,3,3              You might be able to get in "FDFT,3~4" after, if the
                          opponent doesn't get up right away.

WS+3                    Lei's strongest WS attack. Very useful if you end up
                          in WS during a juggle.

WS+4                    Not as damaging as "WS+3", but has quicker recovery.

BT,3                    Lei's strongest attack from BT.

BT,d+1                  I usually do "BT,d+4,[d]" after this ender, which
                          will hit the opponent if they remain on the ground.

BT,d+4,[d]              A good juggle ender to use when you are in "BT" and
                          the opponent is close to hitting the ground.

CRA,2                   I usually do "BT,d+4,[d]" after this ender, which
                          will hit the opponent if they remain on the ground.

PAN,1,2                 A very stylish way to end a juggle.

SNA,1,1,1,1,1,[f]       A good ender if you are in the Snake stance during
                          a juggle

TGR,4                   If you are in the Tiger stance, and the opponent is
                          about to hit the ground, this is a great option.

DRU,1,[f]               A very stylish way to end a juggle.

FC,d/f+3                A good option for some juggles when you are in the
                          "FC" position and there are few other options
                          available.

FC,d/f+4                A good option for some juggles when you are in the
                          "FC" position and there are few other options
                          available.



Wall Juggle Ender       Info / Comments
-----------------       ---------------

f+3,3                   Overall, the best attack to end a wall combo.

d+4,[d]                 Good for when you want to attempt to get in one hit
                          from a wall combo.

b+1+2                   A very stylish way to end a wall combo.

f,N+3                   Does decent damage, however this might be a bit
                          difficult to connect if the opponent doesn't hit
                          the wall high enough.

d/f+1+2                 If you're close enough, you should be able to
                          connect "WS+3" after.

WS+3                    If you're close enough to the opponent, this
                          ender should connect.  Does good damage.

CRA,3,4,2,3             Does a lot of damage against the wall.

SNA,1,1,1,1,1,[f]       Does a lot of damage against the wall.

NOTE: For most launchers, the guaranteed damage total doesn't begin until
      the opponent is launched.  Not all of the hits are guaranteed to hit
      the opponent, so the actual damage may be less in the combo listed
      below.  The damage after each combo below assumes that the opponent
      isn't blocking during the combo (unless indicated).  It was easier
      for me to write it this way.

This section covers strategies for Lei, and analyzes some of his moves.



======================================================
                     Strategy
======================================================


Starting the Match
------------------
Most opponents like to throw out jabs at the beginning of a match.
Here are a few different ways that I like to begin a match:
1) A backdash (b,b) will cause some of your opponent's attacks to miss,
   which leaves them vulnerable.
2) Go straight into "Play Dead" (d+3+4).  You have a few options from
   this position.  If your opponent throws out a high or mid attack, your
   opponent is at a disadvantage to your "Play Dead" attacks.  But, be
   aware that you may be vulnerable to some mid and low attacks.
3) Go straight into "Back Turn" (b+3+4).  Doing this move puts a little
   bit more space between you can your opponent. While in this position,
   I like to immeditely do "BT,d+1" or "BT,d+4,[d]", which sets you up
   for a juggle opportunity.  This isn't very useful if your opponent
   doesn't attack or approach you.
4) Throw out a quick "Left Right Punch" (1,2)
5) Start of by doing a right jump kick (u/f+4)
6) Perform the "Rave Spin" (d/b+4,4)


Drunken Master Auto-Punch Parry
-------------------------------
If you think your opponent will throw out some jabs, perform the
Drunken Master Auto-Punch Parry (f+3+4).  You will parry the attack,
and the opponent's side will be facing you.  This will make the
opponent have to guess what your next attack will be.  Here, I usually
do "u/f+4" or "d/b+4,4".


Bull Fighter
------------
My favorite thing to do with Lei is to go into the Snake stance, then SSR
into the Panther stance when the opponent is about to attack, then do
"PAN,1,2" or "PAN,2". Doing this will sidestep most of your opponent's
attacks and will leave them open for a counter-attack. This strategy sort
of resembles a bull-fighter.


Upsy-Daisy
----------
While in the FUFT position, do the "Spring Up" (FUFT 3+4), then go
immediately into "Play Dead" (d+3+4).  If your opponent throws out a
high or mid attack, you might be at an advantage to execute your
"Play Dead" attacks.  But, be aware that some mid attacks might hit you.
Also, if your opponent does a low attack, this strategy won't work.


Up and Over
-----------
If you do an attack that leaves your opponent lying on the ground, run
up and jump over them.  This will put you in the Back Turn position (BT).
If you think your opponent will try to get up or attack at this point,
do a "BT,d+1".  If you think they'll stay on the ground, you can do
"BT,d+4,[d]", or jump over the grounded opponent again to try to bait
them into moving.  You can also use this strategy to jump over an
opponent who is just getting up after being knocked down.  Some of their
attacks will miss if they attempt to attack you right away.


Tiger's Rear End
----------------
Do the "Tiger Fang to Tiger Stance" (d/f+1+2~f), then start backing up.
If the opponent comes after you or tries to attack, do "TGR,4", which
gives you a juggle opportunity.


Kamikaze
--------
If there is some distance between you and the opponent, you can run towards
them and do one of the following moves:
- u/f+4 (go into a juggle)
- Any grab (my favorite is the "2+4" grab)
- b+4,[f] (see "Scythe Kick" info)
- d/b+4,4 (can also do "d/b+4,[d]" into a juggle)
- d+4,[d] (can go into "Bull Fighter" strategy)
- d+3+4 (see "Play Dead" info)
NOTE: "WR+3" is not a good move to use in this situation, because the
      opponent can sidestep your attack, which leaves you wide open for
      an attack.


Kamikaze Okizeme
----------------
If there is some distance between you and a grounded opponent, you can run
towards them and do one of the following moves:
- b+4,[f] (May hit opponent if they attempt to attack from the ground)
- d/b+4,[d] (Will hit grounded opponents)
- d+4,[d] (Will hit the opponent if they attempt to move)
- 3~4 (Will evade low attacks and hit the opponent)
- WR+4 (May hit ground rolling and backrolling opponents)
- U/F (see "Up and Over" strategy)
NOTE: "WR+3" may hit backrolling opponents, but I wouldn't recommend it in
      this situation.  If you miss, you will be wide open to get attacked.



======================================================
                   Move Analysis
======================================================


Play Dead (d+3+4)
-----------------
"Play Dead" is one of the main reasons why I decided to learn how to
play with Lei back in Tekken 3.  It was a great evasive move back then,
and it still is in Tekken 5.  You will go into the "FUFA" position and
can avoid all high, most mid, and some low attacks.  In this position,
you can force the opponent to guess whether you're going mid or low.


Sidewind (d+1+2)
------------------
The addition of the "Bicycle Kicks" (FDFA,3+4) makes the "Sidewind" a
lot more useful.  The "Bicycle Kicks" can be used against opponents
that pressure you while in the FDFA position.  You can also keep them
guessing with the "Sliding Kick" (FDFA,4~3).  Be carful, because if
any of the two above attacks are blocked, the opponent can get in
free hits.


Back Turn (b+3+4)
-----------------
"Back Turn" is another great evasive more.  It puts some distance
between you and the opponent, so some of your opponents attacks may
miss.  From the "BT" position, I mostly use "BT,d+1" "BT,2", "BT,d+2",
and "BT,d+4,[u_d]". You should mix these moves up to keep the opponent
guessing.  Sometimes I use "BT,1" and "BT,3", but mostly just in combos.


Razor Rush (f,N+1<2<1<2,(3_<4))
-------------------------------
The "Razor Rush" is one of Lei's trademark moves.  No other fighter
has a move quite like this.  Directly from this move, you have an
opportunity to go into 5 of Lei's stances by sidestepping after one
of the attacks.  You should mix up the "3" and "4" for the last
attack to keep the opponent guessing.  The "4" can be sidestepped,
and the "3" can easily be low parried, but if you mix things up, this
move can be useful.


One Two Kick (f,N+3,(4_d+4))
-------------------------------
This move can be very useful.  If blocked, the "One Two Kick" causes a
guard stun, which when followed by "4" (escapable stun on normal hit) or
"d+4" (trip juggle starter on CH) forces the opponent to guess whether
they should block mid or low.  The "d+4" can be low parried, but neither
"4" or "d+4" can be sidestepped.  If the "f,N+3" is ducked or whiffs, you
are vulnerable to being attacked.


Rush Combo (f,N+4~1,2,3,(4_d+4))
--------------------------------
This move is pretty much the same as the "One Two Kick", but this is a
little safer if the first misses, since the second attack is mid.  However,
it is easy to get poked out of this move if the first hit whiffs.  The
"Rush Combo" also has a few other options, which can be found in the
movelist.

If everything up to the "3" is blocked, this move causes a guard stun,
which when followed by "4" (escapable stun on normal hit) or "d+4"
(trip juggle starter stun on CH) forces the opponent to guess whether they
should block mid or low.  The "d+4" can be low parried, but neither "4" or
"d+4" can be sidestepped.  However, some of the other options may from the
"Rush Combo" may useful (such as "f,N+4~1,2,2,2") since the the "3" can be
ducked, which leaves you open for attack.


Rising Mid Kick (WS+3)
----------------------
This is a very useful move.  If you're close enough, you can hit
grounded opponents.  Also, it is guaranteed after blocking certain
low attacks, like the universal "GRND 3" low attack, and Bryan's
"Snake Kick" (d/f+3).


Scythe Kick (b+4,[f])
---------------------
This is a good evasive attack.  You can use this move if you feel
like getting some distance between you can the opponent.  You can
do this move multiple times to try to bait your opponent.  If they
whiff an attack while you perform a "Scythe Kick", you may be able
to connect "f,f+2".


Twin Snake Strikes to Panther Stance (f+1+2,(U_D))
--------------------------------------------------
After doing this move, you will in the Panther Stance.  Some
opponents may not see the transition into the Panther stance
and will attempt to attack right away.  If they do a high attack,
they will be open for a "PAN,1,2" or "PAN,2".  However, you are
vulnerable to mid attacks.


Drunken Master Punch Parry (f+3+4 _ DRU,f+3+4)
----------------------------------------------
This move parries high/mid punches and will end with your opponent's
side facing you.  If they don't attempt to attack right away, then
you're able to make them have to guess what you're going to do.
After the parry, I will usually do "u/f+4" into a combo, or "d/b+4,4".


Low Kick to Snake Stance (d+4~d)
--------------------------------
"d+4" is one of Lei's fastest low attacks.  With this move, I like to
use the "Bull-Fighter" strategy right after going into the Snake stance.
This is the best move to hit an opponent rolling on the ground.


Spring Up (FUFT 3+4)
--------------------
If your opponent is not to far away, "Spring Up" can be used as bait.
I usually attack right after doing this move, using either "d/f+2",
"d/b+4,4", "d+(1_2)" or go right into "Play Dead" (d+3+4).  This move
can evade some low attacks, and may hit your opponent if they're close
enough. However, this move is kind of risky to use, because you are
vulnerable to mid and low attacks.


Mauling Dragon (f,f+2)
----------------------
The "Mauling Dragon" is a great move to punish whiffed attacks.
For example, you can punish "FUFT 3" and "FUFT 4".  You can also
use the "Mauling Dragon" to punish moves with a long recovery time.



======================================================
                Strategy for Grabs
======================================================


Double Foot Stomp (1+3 _ f+1+3)
-------------------------------
This grab will put a lot of distance between you and your opponent.
You can do the normal running attacks "WR+4", "WR+1+2", "WR+3", and
also the "Kamikaze" strategy if your opponent gets up right away.
Don't do this grab if your back is close to a wall, because you will
hit the wall and receive 2 points of damage.


Sleeper Hold (2+4 _ f+2+4)
--------------------------
This is my favorite grab to do with Lei.  After the grab, you can get
in a "d/b+3" if the opponent stays still or attempts to get up.  If
the opponent tries to ground roll, you can do "d+4,[d]"


Dragon Falls (u/f+1+2)
----------------------
If the opponent attempts to get up after this grab, you can usually
get in a "FDFA,3+4" if the opponent attempts to get up, but if the
opponent doesn't attempt to get up at this time, you will miss the
attack, and your opponent can get in a free hit.  However, if you
think that your opponent will backroll or remain on the ground, you
can do "FDFA,4~3".


Out of Control (SNA,1+3 _ DGN,1)
---------------------------------------
With this grab, Lei can enter the "Drunken Master Walk" (DRU) by
pressing "1+2" after grabbing the opponent.  Doing this, Lei
will receive 10 points of health and will deal 23 damage to the
opponent, instead of the normal 33 damage.


Tripping (f,f+1+2)
------------------
If the opponent attempts to backroll or stand up after the grab,
then you should be able to get in a "d+4,[d]".  You can do "d/b+3"
if they stay on the ground.

If an opponent attempts to backroll after hitting the ground, I
like to do the "Asteroid Kick" (u/f+3+4), which will catch the
opponent, and gives you a juggle opportunity.  The combo I usually
use in this situation is:
{Backrolling opponent} u/f+3+4; BT,d+1; BT,3
More combos can be found in the "Combo List" section


Crane Kick (CRA,4)
------------------
If "CRA,4" connects, you should be able to connect "4~4" on the
grounded opponent, or you can try other okizeme possibilities, like
running up and doing "d+4,[d]" if they try to get up.


Staggering Slide (DRU,3+4)
--------------------------
If "DRU,3+4" connects, you may be able to connect "FDFT,3~4" on
the grounded opponent, or maybe even "FDFT,3~4,4" if they try
to get up.



======================================================
                      Spacing
======================================================


If you need to create some spacing between you and the
opponent, here are some moves that might be useful:

b,b
The "Back Dash" is the universal way to create some distance between
you and the oppenent.

u/b
Similar to the "Back Dash", this move is also universal.  You may
be able to avoid low attacks, but you are vulnerable while in the air.

b+3+4~b
Creates more distance and is faster than "b,b".

[BT] d+3+4,(:b _ qcb)
You can roll away quickly while going into the "Play Dead" stance.

b+4
You can create some distance, while attacking at the same time.



======================================================
                     Other Info
======================================================

- I like to play Lei with a mix between bulldog and turtle strategies.
  Bulldog = Strategies like Kamikaze
  Turtle = Moves like Play Dead
- No other fighter has the ability to effectively attack
  from any position quite like Lei (BT, Grounded, etc.)
- "DRU,1+2" and "b+1+2" can evade high attacks.
- The Snake, Dragon, Panther, Tiger, and Crane stances will automatically
  face you towards your opponent when the opponent is behind you.

I've received some questions through e-mail, so in this section,
you can read my response to those questions.


----------
Question 1 - Semicolon
----------

Q:  "I haven't seen anyone else use a semicolon while writing combos.
    Is that a special symbol in your FAQ?"

A:  I'm one of the only people that uses a semicolon for writing combos.
    I use it to clearly separate the different commands used within a
    combo.  The way that some people write their combos, using only
    commas make it unclear exactly what is going on.  I thought that
    it would be a good symbol to use since nobody uses it for anything
    else.


----------
Question 2 - Weapons in matches?
----------

Q:  Can Lei use his gun in a match?

A:  No, he cannot use his gun, or any other weapon in a match.


----------
Question 3 - Lei's Dragon to Tiger
----------

Q:  "I can't seem to do lei's f,N+4~1,2,2~f, DGN, 1+3 into tiger...
    it comes out as the drunken throw."

A:  Press "1+3" right after entering DGN from "f,N+4,1,2,2~f".
    There's a small window when the move can be done,
    which can be seen with "Hit Analysis" in Practice Mode.
    During this window, "1+3" into TGR is the only possible move.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The main purpose of "Tekkenomics" is to provide you with Tekken FAQs/Guides
and to keep you updated on Tekken news and information.

"Tekkenomics" was originally the name of the website created by me
(Wild Man X), with help from Paulinstein and Drake the Demon, which first
came online on November 6, 2004.  However, due to someone engaging in
piracy on our hosting server the website went down in April 2007.  With
the release of Tekken 6 approaching for consoles, I decided to bring back
Tekkenomics, but in the form of a blog back in June 2009.

"Tekkenomics" contains various Tekken related material, some of which is
difficult to find on any other Tekken based website.  The blog will
contain exclusive articles, original FAQ files, move lists, combos/juggles,
combo videos, in-game matches, Tekken commercials, PC desktop wallpaper,
PSP wallpaper, CG art, fan-based material, and other things.

If you're having problems visiting the "Tekkenomics Blog" at
http://www.tekkenomics.com, then you can also visit it at the following
link: http://tekkenomics.wordpress.com

If you were wondering how we came up with the name "Tekkenomics", back in
my high school days in the year 2000, Paulinstein, me, and some other high
school friends would get together to play Tekken 3 on the PlayStation 1.
At the time, we were also enrolled in Economics. Whenever we would get
together to play, we would say that we were going to study some
"Tekkenomics".  So, basically: "Tekken" + "Economics" = "Tekkenomics".

There are a few references on the web to the name "Tekkenomics" that
aren't related to us or our blog.  There are some members on the Tekken
Zaibatsu forums that go by the names "Tekkenomics", "Tekkenomics_101",
and "TekkenNomics Jr." that aren't related to us. On Tekken Zaibatsu,
we go by the names "Wild Man X", "Paulinstein", and "Drake the Demon".
The things on the web that ARE related to us are at: GameFAQs, Neoseeker,
IGN, 1UP.com, Gamerhelp, Gamespot, MySpace, AIM, MSN Messenger, Hotmail,
GMail, YouTube, PicasaWeb, Blogger, WordPress, ImageShack, and Twitter.

I have been a fan of the Tekken series since 2000.  A few of my friends
got me into the series with Tekken 3.

My first FAQ was "Hidden Moves" for Tekken 4.  Writing this FAQ, I've
learned some new things about Tekken along the way that I probably
wouldn't have learned otherwise.  My FAQs are a way for me to share
what I have learned.

Lei Wulong is my main fighter, and has been since Tekken 3.  When I bought
Tekken Tag Tournament for the PS2, I decided to learn how to play with all
of the fighters, and this has carried over to Tekken 4, Tekken 5, and
Tekken: Dark Resurrection.  So, you can rest assured that I do atleast
know a little bit about what I'm talking about :)

I am currently residing in Southern California (in the United States),
but have not been to any of the arcades in the area in a long time.  I
used to play at the University of California, Riverside.

I hope that you've enjoyed my FAQs!
