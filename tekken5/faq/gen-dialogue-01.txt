==============================================================================

I have a Japanese PS2, which means I was "stuck" waiting for the Japanese
version of Tekken 5!  That's certainly unfair... I had the Japanese Tekken 2
a good 9 (nine) months before the rest of you suckers in the US, and I
enjoyed similar early release dates for Tekken 3, Tekken Tag, and Tekken 4.

The Japanese version, as you all know, was released not just "a little" later,
but a whole MONTH later, with improved ghost AI being the only enhancement.
As I played, I realized I wouldn't be able to fully enjoy the Story Battle, 
since I only had a rather limited command of Japanese.

Luckily, my cousin got Tekken 5 as well, so on the weekends I would transcribe
about a dozen of the characters' dialogues.  The slightly annoying part was
losing on purpose just for the sake of not missing any "losing" dialogues. 
The VERY annoying part was trying to beat Jinpachi with characters I don't 
even use, because most of the time there wasn't a point in going on past the
2nd rival!

Still, it wasn't as bad as Devil Within!  I'm not sure I'll ever get around
to finishing that last stage... bleh...


I'm also planning on doing this entire thing for the Japanese version too.
I've already noticed a few small differences.  For example, in the US
version, Baek says "Why don't you join in on one of my sessions?", while he
says something like "You'll become strong" in the Japanese version.  Of
course, I don't know Korean, so I can't say which is the more correct
translation.  Ultimately, this is to improve my Japanese, and what better
way than with phrases like "isoidahoo ga ii... shinitaku nakereba na" ("You
should hurry, if you don't want to die...") and "ano toki no bakudan robotto
no nakama da na" ("You're one of those exploding robots from before, huh?")

Not all characters have a 4th or 7th rival.  Some do not fight Devil Jin on
the 8th stage, and sometimes the dialogues with Jinpachi are different.  And 
only some have "losing" dialogues (and not as many as I would have hoped).  
This chart lets you see it all at a glance:

I've been assured that all the text, dialogue, and endings for the T5
characters are the same in the PSP Tekken: Dark Resurrection.  Even if 
they're slightly different, though, I wouldn't feel like typing them down
again, and I'm sure you wouldn't bother to read them just to check anyway.

 :: 1.3  Jinpachi Mishima ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 4850d
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The arcade mode (I mean the actual arcade version of Tekken 5, if you can
find it) had the same Jinpachi dialogue for all characters... I think.  I
only played Hwoarang back then, and that was when I was exclusively playing 
shooters like Strikers 1945 III.  

Also notice that the girls... well, TURN AROUND DIFFERENTLY from the guys!
Fire up that VCR and get to Jinpachi with both Eddy and Christie - it'll
blow your mind!!!!1  

(UPDATE: You can also see the standard Jinpachi dialogue for all characters 
by just playing through the Time Attack mode.  Shows how much I paid 
attention to that...)

About the CG Ending: You can see this ending by losing to Jinpachi in
Story Battle and NOT continuing, though apparently if you beat the game
with Jinpachi (who is ONLY playable with some cheat device), you can get
it that way as well.

When I borrowed my friend's PSP to update this FAQ, I forgot to check for
any Time Attack differences.  Oh well... maybe next time.

Answer me!

Fight me and you'll

Now talk!
What are your true intentions?!


[Jinpachi]
It was 40 years ago...
I was confined in the basement of

the Mishima estate after
I was betrayed by my son.

I survived for a while but I eventually
...died.

But...even though I died, this "thing"
took over my body and revived me

to my present state. It has denied
me of my right to die on my own terms.

This "thing" tells me to destroy the world
and eliminate anyone who gets in the way.

I have no choice
but to follow its orders.

With my last act of human consciousness,
I sent the letter to Wang.


[Lei]
Then you stole the scroll
from China as well?


[Jinpachi]
That was my son, Heihachi.
I will return it now.

My time has come to an end....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ling Xiaoyu.
Out to save the Mishima Zaibatsu.
She learned the Zaibatsu's troubled
history after Yoshimitsu rescued her.

-

Xiaoyu felt it all began when Heihachi
threw Kazuya into a ravine.

She cried when she heard of Heihachi's death.
"If only I could turn back time..." says Xiaoyu.

-

Around then, a scientist told her he
could create a time machine...for a price.

She opens her invitation to The King of
Iron Fist Tournament 5. With the prize
money, she could make everything right.

Jin!


[Jin]
Xiao,
this tournament is dangerous!

Leave at once!


[Xiaoyu]
No! If certain things in the past didn't
happen, then Grandpa Heihachi

wouldn't have had to die like he did.
I'm going to turn back the hands of time!


[Jin]
Time can't be reversed.
Heihachi is dead.

Whatever is in charge of the Zaibatsu is
something far more dangerous than him!


[Xiaoyu]
I'll make everything like it was!
All of it!

[Xiaoyu]
I'm sorry, Jin. I had to...

But wait...
If I win the tournament,

we can go back to the good times,
the way things used to be...

If I can take this guy down, the prize
money and time machine will be mine.

I have to win!

[Xiaoyu]
If I'm successful,

There!


[Heihachi]
So, are you scared?



[Kazuya]
Dammit, you old fart!

Let me go!


[Heihachi]
(Well, if he's going to have a chance as
my successor, he must have no fear.)


[Xiaoyu]
Looks like it didn't work...
I guess you just can't change the past...


[scientist]
No matter what happened in the past,
it's impossible to rewrite history.

The best you can hope for
are minor improvements!

Yoshimitsu.
A ninja helping the poor.
While breaking into the Mishima

Bryan Fury and helped him escape.

A month later, when Yoshimitsu visited
Dr. Boskonovich's lab, he found his
comrades dead. This was Bryan's thanks.

A frozen land buried in dense sub arctic forests.
While undergoing geological research in preparation
for the development of natural resources, an anomalous
object is discovered below the permafrost.

The military quickly calls special forces into action
and the entire area is completely sealed off.
The mysterious object is then transferred under absolute
secrecy to a research facility for further study.

-

A month later, military headquarters receive
an investigative report regarding the mysterious
object and decides to order one of the men working
at the dig on a clandestine mission.

That man is Dragunov, a member of an elite special
forces team who is feared in battlefronts throughout
the world as the White Angel of Death.

He acknowledges the mission with a silent nod
and leaves for Japan.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lili, the only daughter of a wealthy oil magnate in Monaco.
Four years ago, she was captured and held ransom for that
very reason.
While in captivity, she struggled violently to
free herself, taking out one of her captors.
That fight triggered her hunger for battle.

-

However, Lili's father was a good hearted man
who hated conflict.

"I don't want father to be upset with me...
but I also want to fight."

Lili could no longer control her urge to fight.
Under the guise of a simple vacation, she used
the family's private jet to take part
in street fighting tournaments around the world.

-

One day, she receives an invitation to a certain
fighting tournament from an opponent she defeated
in San Francisco.

Lili soon realizes that the host of this tournament
was none other than the Mishima Zaibatsu, the main
sources of her father's problems.

She decides to enter the tournament and put an end
to her father's troubles.

Miss, can you take a look at this?

Do you know this place?


[Lili]
Wow, such robust eyebrows!

Just like my father's!

No, I can't...

I must remain focused until 
I've defeated Mishima!

 :: 4.2  Rantings ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ae0b2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Anyone who thinks Tekken 5 needs wall tech is an idiot!

- I can't believe people are complaining about the "no language barriers" in
  the Story Battle!  Would you rather have all the "Asians" speak Japanese 
  and "non-Asians" speak English (like Soul Blade), or have EVERYONE speak 
  Japanese (like Soul Calibur), or listen to forced and unintentionally
  hilarious English (like Tekken 4)?  If you can't appreciate the Baek, 
  Hwoarang, Feng, and Wang voiceovers (among others), you're an idiot!  
  Spoken Korean is absolutely beautiful (if spoken by a pretty girl), and 
  Chinese is (last time I checked) still exotic in video games.  Exotic
  means "cool."

- Baek IS better than Hwoarang!  I'm absolutely convinced that a well played
  Baek is better AND flashier than Hwoarang ever could be!  And stop calling
  Hwoarang "Bob"!  Look how many damn "Who is Bob?" threads there are in the
  TZ forums!  And where the hell did "Boy On Bike" come from?  That's the
  stupidest thing I've ever heard... and I've heard A LOT of stupid things!

- Hurry up and put Tekken online, Namco!  I don't care if you have to create
  the technology yourself, just DO IT!  And what's with the people saying
  "I'd rather have no online play than bad online play"?  IF YOU DON'T WANT
  TO PLAY ONLINE, JUST DON'T FRIGGIN' PLAY ONLINE!!!

Thanks to my cousin and his "questionably obtained" Tekken 5...  but I have to
thank the makers of the Swap Magic even more!  That thing is simply INSPIRED.
It works great and tells everyone both "I'm too cool for my PS2 front cover"
and "I can play imports and 'backups'".  Also, thanks to Leadtek, the makers
of WinFast TV 2000, the best video capture card out there (second to whatever
the heck Castel uses).  You don't think I recorded all these dialogues on a
videotape and pressed the Pause button like an animal, do you?

Oh, and thanks to everyone who e-mailed about the FAQ!  Glad to know I wasn't
