I. Basic Introduction
_____________________________________________________________________________

Prelude - This guide is intended to be used as a reference only. Some of
the strategies that I detail did come from my mind. However, the majority
of this FAQ is written based on multiple sources on the web as well as the
help of many high-level players. It is simply a collection of as much
information as I could get including my personal experiences from playing.
I assure you, I have been around the block (and the country) with Tekken. I
would also like people to keep in mind that I am not all-knowing. If
something in whatever section is wrong, let me know. I make mistakes or
forget about things. Same goes with typos. I read my FAQs a couple times to
try and catch typos, but it happens. If you find one that is bugging
you, just e-mail me and I'll update it. I'm human, too.

Note for using this FAQ - If you have Internet Explorer (I do not know if
other internet browsers have this feature) you can use Control+F to find
certain things on a webpage. This can be used to quickly skip to any portion
of this FAQ via the codes preceding any Table of Contents title. Also, I
HIGHLY recommend that you read the "Basics Guide" FAQ. If you don't and
don't already know all of the words and notations I use, this FAQ will make
no sense. The basics FAQ is filled with stuff that real Tekken players use
all the time. It's a good reference for stuff that you should just know if
you want to be good at Tekken.

Also, keep in mind that when I refer to a number I will spell out the number
if it's a quantity and simply put the numerical symbol if it's a button
press. So when I say, "Keep in mind, though, that the first 2 is +1 on
block," I mean the first right punch of the string, not the first two hits.

_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<II1. The DSS/DFS Transition and Parry>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


I'm going to brush on the movelist here a little because it goes with the
subject. First, DSS stands for Dragon Sign Stance and DFS stands for Dragon
Fake Step. There's multiple ways to enter both, but the simplest is to press
d+1+2 for DSS and b+1+2 for DFS. DFS is actually more complex, but b+1+2
looks the exact same though it has different properties. 

******

There's eleven different things you can do when you go into DSS or DFS.

1 - A short backhand. Safe on block and causes a minor block stun for the
     opponent. High.
f+1 - A huge thrusting fist, usually called Dragon Knuckle. Relatively safe
     on block and pushes the opponent far away. Mid.
1<f+1 - DSS 1 followed by DSS f+1. You can quickly transition between the two
     if the first hit is blocked or it misses. The delay that is possible
     between the two is incredibly long.
2~1 - Poison arrow. A slow mid that is relatively safe on block and guarantees
     extra hits on CH. Can be performed while standing by pressing f+2~1.
2 and any string beginning with 2 - Self explanatory. Instead of doing a DSS
     specific move, you can come out with a normal 2 jab and do any string
     that begins with 2.
3 - A huge side kick. Relatively safe on block.
3+4 - Law's new flying kick. A lot of times you'll see it referred to as "The
     Kick." It's high and gives the opponent horrible recovery on block.
4,3 - A low followed by a mid JS. This looks very similar to the last two
     hits of b+2,3,4. Safe on block. Second hit is guaranteed if the low hits
     CH.
2+4 - Close to a normal 2+4 grab except different animation and damage. The
     break is still 2.
2+3 - Exact same grab as f+2+3 except out of DSS. 1 break.
1+3 - Normal 1+3 grab except it cannot be advancing.

******

Okay, now comes the most important and hardest to get down part of Law's
game: The DFS to DSS transition. During some moves, you can press b~f and
when the move is finished Law will go into DFS. This looks exactly like
b+1+2. However, there's no immediate punch parry like b+1+2, it's just
a similar animation step. When you go into DFS you can press either f or b~f
to go into DSS. Some moves go straight into DSS, so no extra f_b~f is
necessary. Generally, punches go straight to DSS while kicks go to DFS. The
best way to start learning this is to start SLOWLY. 

First, try to do something like a 4,3~DSS transition. The notation looks
something like this: 4,3~b~f~(f_b~f). If you want to start out even simpler,
do 1,2~DSS which would be 1,2~b~f. Since it's a punch, it will go directly
to DSS, not DFS first. I'll list some juggles in the juggle section that will
involve DSS transitions. It's better to practice the strings outside of the
juggle first to get the hang of the timing before you attempt the juggle.
Eventually, you'll be able to do the transition so fast it becomes second
nature and you'll hardly see the DFS.

******

There's another move that Law can go into DSS from and that's his parry,
b+(2+4_1+3). First, just an FYI, Law can parry high and mid moves. There are
some moves in the game that just cannot be parried. You have to just know
what they are through trial and error.

After you successfully parry a move, if you press b~f, Law will go into
DSS. This is important because it guarantees him extra hits. After a
successful parry~DSS transition the following options are guaranteed: DSS 2,
DSS 1, grab attempt.

A couple notes, however. There's no guarantee that they won't break your grab.
Commonsense, but it has to be said. The grabs can still be broken. The DSS
2+3 grab will also sometimes whiff so it's better to just go with DSS 1+3
if you want a 1 break throw. Some kicks that are parried can be punished
with DSS f+1. This is EXTREMELY situational and you have to be VERY fast to
hit it. It was guaranteed in T4 no matter what was parried, but that's no
longer the case. I would recommend not doing DSS f+1 after a parry otherwise
you're going to miss out on a lot of damage.

Also, if you go into DSS from a move (i.e. going into DSS anyway other than
d+1+2), during the first few frames of animation of the stance he will 
automatically parry. This rarely happens, but if it does, it does not require
that you press b~f but rather it will parry and go back into DSS for you. 
Simply put, it's a normal parry~DSS transition with you only having to go
into DSS from another move.

******

Law also has b+1+2 which is his punch-only parry. Notes for this section: I
will often refer to b+1+2 as PP (punch parry). When I use notation such as
PP~1, automatically assume that you should press 1 after the PP SUCCESSFULLY
parries a punch unless otherwise noted.

A note for b+1+2. If you don't successfully parry a punch with this, Law will
do a little dance. After some of the dance is done, you can do DSS moves. The
main reason I bring this up is because if you press 3+4 after b+1+2, he'll do
DSS 3+4 almost immediately after the step begins. This is important because
it's the ONLY move that can come out that fast from PP. Considering that
it's brandnew, you may catch some people with this. And depending on how good
your spacing is, you may be able to dodge and punish moves with this as well.

To start off, this move has been nerfed incredibly over the past couple
Tekkens. In Tekken 4, PP~1, d+4,3 was guaranteed unless the opponent knew of
the one way to get out of it which is not well known. In Tekken 5, it's not
even that hard, just BD out of it. So far, we've yet to find anything that
is guaranteed after PP~1. It seems that the best option off of PP is either
PP~2, dash, 2,2 or PP~3. I prefer PP~2, dash, 2,2 because of his BT options
which will be explained later.

A new feature of PP is the window for parrying a punch. Up until Tekken 5,
there was a very strict window involved in order to parry a punch with this
move. Now, it seems that the window for parrying a punch stays active until
Law recovers.

Remember that after you successfully parry a punch, you must input 1,2,3 or 4
otherwise Law will do nothing and just shove the arm aside. Also remember
that the later in the animation that the parry occurs, the faster you have to
input a follow-up command in order for it to come out.




<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<II2. Detailed Movelist and Descriptions>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


Prelude - This is not an ENTIRE movelist. If you want to know Law's movelist,
go to practice and go through the game's movelist. I am only listing moves I
believe are important to Law's game (or contrastly, NOT important for good
reasons). I will refer to frames a LOT, so make sure you have read the Basics
FAQ if you do not know what frames are. I will usually not refer to how fast
a move comes out (as in how many frames it takes for the move to execute).
That information is important, but it's easier to go to tekkenzaibatsu.com
and look at the frame data from Tekken 4. The frame data for Tekken 5 has not
yet been figured out completely, so I'll give frames of new moves when I know
them.

******

Grabs - As far as grabbing is concerned, every single grab that Law has is
     important for a number of reasons. 

     1+3_2+4 - These are important because the 2+4 grab leaves Law in such
     a prime oki position (which will be explain later in section II3) that
     people may start to break 2 which is where the other grab comes in. Mix
     it up.

     f+2+3 - This is the ol' run-up-and-drop throw. The only redeeming factor
     of this throw is that it comes out one frame faster than all normal
     throws, including the rest of this list. Other than that, its range is
     so short it's practically useless so just going with a regular 1+3 grab
     is a better option.

     d/f+1+2[,1,2,1+2] - Just to let anyone know, 1+2 breaks are the hardest
     to break for that reason; it's a two-button break. It's all preference
     whether you do the headlock punch or the bulldog drop, but the
     difference between the two isn't all that much. The bulldog drop does a
     little more damage but gives very little oki. The headlock punch doesn't
     do as much damage but leaves them in prime position for excellent
     mix-ups. After reading section II3, you'll make up your own mind based
     on how you like to play. I, personally, mix it up between the two to 
     maximize potential.

     f,f+3+4 - A change between T4 and T5, this is now a 1+2 break. No longer
     is it a 1 break. This grab has two redeeming qualities: One, it's a 1+2
     break and, two, it has the most potential for damage because it allows
     for juggles. Hit up the juggle section for the different possible
     juggles. The only problem with this grab is that it's somewhat easy to 
     see because of the f,f. This is why you must get really fast at doing
     f,f and try to throw it out in situations where it's hard to see the f,f
     dash.

******

Now for the real hitters.

1,2,3 and its variants - This is one of Law's biggest pressuring moves. I,
     however, don't use the last knee (the 3) of the string a whole lot
     simply because they nerfed the recovery of it. In Tekken 4, the 3 was -1
     on block. This means that they had to either do a TC move or a move that
     was 9-frames or faster in execution. In Tekken 5, the 3 is -4 on block.
     I tend to stick with 1,2 because on hit I will go into DSS for further
     mix-ups. Some people like 1,1,2 because if the first 1 hits, the
     following two jabs are guaranteed and you can still go into DSS. I don't
     use that simply because if they duck the first one, they have more time
     to punish than just 1,2. It's strictly preference though. 1,2,3 is all
     guaranteed if the first 1 hits CH. The last knee can be blocked if more
     than one 1 is performed. 1,2 is 0 on block and 1 is +1 on block.

d/f+1 - A quick mid-hitting jab. +1 on block. Good for duckers because it is
     completely safe. It is a little on the slow side, however. d/f+1 is also
     the start of Law's 10-string. Always use the d/f+1,3,2 version. It is
     not useful on block because most good players will low parry the 3 on
     reaction, but if the d/f+1 hits, the next two hits are guaranteed.

d+1,3 - A relatively slow low jab to mid kick. Not only is this move a TC,
     but if the d+1 hits CH, the 3 is guaranteed. Good for those who like to
     rush you down with quick, high moves. Use this and it will go under and
     CH them. You CANNOT delay the 3, however, the window for inputting it is
     pretty big considering how long the d+1 takes to come out. I advise
     not guessing whether your opponent is going to do something but trying
     to SEE if the d+1 hits CH, then pressing 3. It takes getting used to but
     worth it. The d+1 is at least negative -11 on block, as is the 3.

b+1<2<1 - This was changed back to how it was in Tekken 3 in that every hit
     is now mid. This is Law's most damaging JS because if either the
     first or second hit is CH, the rest of the string is guaranteed. Plus, it
     seems to have some good priority over other moves which makes up some of
     its lack of speed. The only bad thing about this string is that you can
     SS any hit of it fairly easy. If the first or first two hits are blocked
     you can SS the following hit. You must SSR for the second hit and SSL
     for the last hit. The only time I recommend finishing this string is if
     you think one of the hits hit CH or, for some odd reason, your opponent
     is sitting there and trying to attack after you delay the second hit.
     b+1<2 is still relatively safe because it's hard as hell to SS the 2 and
     most people cannot SS it on reaction. In fact, I've yet to see anyone do
     it. Don't abuse it, though, otherwise they'll SS it because you're
     being predictable. You can go into DSS off of either of the first two
     hits.

u/f+1,3 - This move isn't all that good because it's not hard to see the low
     on reaction and low parry it. However, the u/f+1 seems to be 0 on block
     and on CH, 4,3 (which is 12-frames) and anything faster that will reach
     is guaranteed. Good things to know, but not a move to be used a lot.

qcf+1,2,1,2 - No longer does Law have a power punch. Now he has a new string.
     I would have preferred the power punch, but this string has the same
     properties, for the most part. If any of the string hits CH, the entire
     thing is guaranteed. Only the last hit is punishable on block and only
     to a certain extent, so it's better to stop at the jabs if you see them
     block. It seems like it still comes out in 8-frames and you CAN buffer
     this move during recovery. I wouldn't abuse this move too much because
     the first three hits are high.

f+1+2[~D] - Dragon Hammer(crouch). This is definitely one of Law's top moves.
     I would recommend ALWAYS doing the ~D version because not only does it
     leave Law in crouch, which you want because his best mix-up comes from
     crouch, but it gives him +4 while f+1+2 gives 0, maybe +1. I'll explain
     the set-ups for this move and what you can do after it hits, is blocked,
     etc. in the next section. The only bad thing about this move is its
     speed, but it's almost impossible to SS.

2,2<1<2 - I only think that the first two hits of this string are good
     because it leaves Law in BT and, in my opinion, Law has really good BT
     options which will be explained even further in the following section. 
     Sometimes, once in a blue moon, it is a good thing to throw the entire
     string out because they might try to attack after the 2,2 if you abuse
     2,2 enough. The reason you don't want to use the last two hits a lot is
     because the third is high and it's not hard to see the first two hits,
     duck the third and punish before the last one comes out for a CH.

f+2~1 - This move is good in the fact that it does quite a bit of damage, is
     mid, gives a juggle on CH and is safe. However, it has no real practical
     purpose because of its speed. It pushes so far away on block that, yes
     it is safe, but it gives no good follow-ups. Plus, it's extremely hard
     to set-up so that you can hunt for a CH.

[f+]2,f+2,(2_1+2) - This string has its uses. First, if you finish with the
     2 version and the first hit connects, the entire string is guaranteed
     unless they duck that last two. However, that's where the 1+2 ender
     comes in. If you see them ducking the last hit, throw that out and
     punish them for guessing. You may add up to four 1 jabs before this, but
     the string is not guaranteed even if the 1 jabs connect. Both enders are
     at least -10, though I believe the 1+2 ender is a little more than that.
     You can go into DSS after the 2 ender. Keep in mind, though, that the
     first 2 is +1 on block.

f,f+2<1<3 - This move is really, really good. I would consider it one of his
     better strings. It's primary uses are for juggling and poking. Juggling
     purposes are pretty explanatory but you can play good mind games with
     poking. First, if the f,f+2 hits, the 1 is guaranteed, no matter how long
     you delay it. If the 1 hits CH, the 3 is guaranteed but it cannot be
     delayed. Be careful because if your opponent is good at seeing this on
     reaction, you can block the f,f+2, duck the 1 and punish. Only the last
     hit is punishable on block but it pushes so far away that you can rest
     easy knowing you won't get juggled or take a severe amount of damage. It
     is at least -10 on block, though.

d/f+2 - Probably his best big-hit whiff punisher. It's fast, safe on block
     and is a JS. Plus, it goes under some highs.

b+2<3<(4_d+4) - Also known as the junkyard combo. This move is NOT good
     outside of juggles or if your opponent is BT. This is the worst mix-up
     that Law has. You can see the d+4 VERY easily and it gives a really bad
     block stun. And most good players won't let you get that far because
     they'll low-parry the 3 on reaction. The only redeeming factor of this
     is that it is really good against BT opponents and the d+4 hits
     grounded. It's just a bad thing to use this against a standing opponent.
     b+2 is a decent long-range poke, though. You can go into DFS after the
     4.

d+2,3 - This move is only good for people in your grill. If they block this
     you ARE going to get launched if they know what's good for them. We have
     yet to find a character who cannot get a JS when they block this. The
     reason it's good against people who are in your grill is because the 
     flip is guaranteed if the d+2 hits CH. Overall, if you use this more than
     once in a match, rethink the way you're playing.

WS+2 - This is one of Law's bread-and-butter JS. For the most part, it's not
     punishable, but there are a few characters who can punish it on block.
     For example, Jack-5 gets a free d/f+2. However, the rewards and mix-ups
     you can do with this greatly overcome the bad things about it. More will
     be explained in the next section. 

BT 2<2 - This is a great new addition to Law's arsenal in T5. Both hits are
     very punishable, but because you can delay the second 2 so long, most
     people do not try to punish the first 2 because they're afraid of eating
     the second one CH. If the first one hits, CH or non-CH, the second one
     is guaranteed, even if you delay it. If it's non-CH, the window for that
     delay is smaller, but with practice it comes as second nature. More
     about this move will be explained in "The BT Game" section.

d+3<3,4 - This move is good to throw out every now and then because if either
     of the first two hits connect CH, the rest is guaranteed. The first hit
     being low is a bonus, too. Bad thing is, all of the hits are punishable
     on block, so be careful.

d/b+3 - This is another good addition. This move is quick and hits low. Plus,
     it's a JS on CH. There's only a couple things bad about it. One, it
     does not TC like d+1. Two, it's punishable on block. Generic WS+4 will
     punish it along with a select few quick, powerful WS moves. Still an
     excellent poke.

b+3[~F_~B] - This is definitely one of the best additions they gave Law. Ever
     complain about being SSed ALL the time in T4? Well, that's what this is
     for. Not only is it pretty fast for it's damage, but it hits mid and 
     tracks like WHOA. It automatically leaves Law in BT, but you can cancel
     that with ~F or ~B and stay facing forward. This move is COMPLETELY safe
     in open areas. The only time this move can be punished is if your
     opponent's back is against the wall, in which case they won't be pushed
     back far enough. Even then, only a select few moves can punish it. You
     should definitely add it to your arsenal of primary moves and, as long
     as your smart with it, it'll do good things for you.

(U/F_U_U/B)+3,4 - This fake somersault is somewhat useful because you don't
     HAVE to do the 4. You can leave yourself in crouch after the flip and do
     other things. This comes into play a lot with slide mix-up, which will
     be explained later. You can also do this little fake somersault after
     1,...,2 jabs by press u/f+3. It's not useful in that situation because
     you can see the somersault on reaction and interrupt it with jabs. The
     4 is relatively safe on block and you can go into DFS after it.

FC,d/f,d,d/f+3 - Probably Law's best and most feared move. Combined with
     WS+2, this move becomes deadly. With so many moves leaving Law in crouch
     this move makes people reconsider their style of play. It is punishable
     on block, but in a very weird way. Because it leaves him on the ground,
     only certain things will punish it. You can reassure yourself that you
     aren't going to eat juggle damage if it's block, but some characters can
     get ground hits or mid-juggle enders. It's rewards more than make up for
     that lack of safety. This move is often called simply "slide," but
     sometimes you'll hear reference to an e-slide which is simply this move
     done as fast as possible. If you do the motion (without pressing 3)
     you'll see Law to a little crouching dash. The purpose of e-slide is
     to do the slide so fast that your opponent can barely see that motion.
     It all depends on the situation which one you should do, I'll cover this
     more in the next section.

WS+3 - This is a decent move. It's extremely safe on block and on CH, if your
     DFS to DSS transition is fast enough, DSS 3 is guaranteed. However, being
     that it IS high, it's not incredibly useful. This move automatically
     goes into DFS.

4,3,4 - These kicks are pretty good. The only time you should ever do the
     last kick is in a juggle, otherwise stop at the 3. If the first one hits
     the 3 is guaranteed. It's one of his prime punishers. Both the 3 and last
     4 can go into DFS. Also, the first 4 on CH is what's commonly called a
     "magic" 4 because it will magically CH things that you would think it
     shouldn't. If it hits CH, a juggle is possible.

SS+3+4 - Rarely will you find a use for this move. It's pretty bad on block,
     so expect to eat some damage. Even if it hits, only in extremely
     situational scenarios is there anything guaranteed after it. I wouldn't
     use it too much.

4,u+3 - This string is not really useful because anyone can jab in-between
     the kick and flip. However, it's only -1 on block which is incredibly
     deceiving. It's only really good in juggles, though.

f,f+4 - I thought I would mention this move so that you know NOT TO EVER use
     it. It's just plain stupid. It gives NEGATIVE frames on HIT!! Plus, it's
     even more punishable on block than any of the new lows they've given
     Law. I see a lot of new players using this and the first thing I say is,
     "Don't."

(d_FC)+4,3 - I only use the first kick of this because it's a pretty good
     poke, but other than that, you should rarely use the flip. It's badly
     punishable on block and is only guaranteed if the 4 hits CH.

d/b+4,4 - The only time you should use this is if you think they're going
     high. This move goes under highs like no one's business. Depending on
     your set-up and predicting skills, it can do some hardcore damage if
     CH. It's preference, but I prefer not to do the second flip because I
     like the oki that I get after the sweep hits. If they block it... say
     goodnight.

(U/F_U_U/B)+4,3 - Both the first flip and both flips are useful in certain
     situations. We'll talk about low parries later, but know for now that
     the double flipkicks will come into play later. Otherwise don't use both
     because the second one is absolutely horrible on block. The first
     flip is good to use by itself because it's relatively safe on block and
     gives good juggle damage. It's a primary launcher, definitely. You can
     also go into crouch after it, so doing the backwards one and then going
     into slide mix-up is gold. I wouldn't do the directly U flip because
     it's more punishable than the other two.

(u/b_u_u/f)+4 - Also called a hopkick. This is a quick, generic launcher.
     Good in situations where you don't have a lot of time to punish but
     still want to juggle. For Law, the u/f version is the best because
     there's no good set-ups off of the other two and the u version only
     launches on CH, making it not near as good as it was in Tag. You CAN
     still use the u/b version for evasice purposes, but who would want to do
     that?

WS+4 - There is a flip kick after it, but I wouldn't use it because it's
     badly punishable. WS+4 is good because you can go into DFS after it. IF
     your DFS to DSS transition is fast enough, WS+4~DSS 2 is guaranteed on
     CH. And on block, not a whole lot can beat it out and most people won't
     duck it. If they do, switch to WS+4~DSS f+1. This becomes important in
     the next section. WS+4 by itself is not punishable and is used in some
     situations as a generic punisher.

BT d+4 - It looks cool and gives a juggle, but forget it exists. There's very
     few situations where it's useful. It's too slow to mix-up with his other
     BT options because you can see it and it's punishable on block. All bad
     qualities.

BT d+3 - This is a generic BT low kick. You'll learn to love it because it's
     a large part of his BT game and is relatively safe on block.




<<<<<<<<<<<<II3. Set-ups and Oki - Creating Your Own Unique Style>>>>>>>>>>>>>

3A. Frame Lockdown:
-------------------

Frame lockdown is a term I use that describes keeping your opponent in
negative frames for as long as possible. Basically, the goal of frame
lockdown is to get into a flow in which your opponent cannot move and, if
they try, they will eat something. I'll try and teach you several ways to
accomplish this, each of which can be mixed up with the others.

Using d/f+1 to its fullest - d/f+1 is not only a pretty quick, safe, mid
     poke, but it also leaves you at +1. A wise choice after d/f+1 is a
     simple 1,2 follow-up. If you think it'll hit CH, go with 1,2,3. Hell,
     you can even do qcf+1,2,1,2 and catch them trying to beat you out. 
     If they block the 1,2 jabs, you're left at 0 so you're back to square
     one. If they try to go under the jabs, there's a few different things
     you can do. If they try to stop your jabs by doing a generic d+1 poke,
     you can either low parry it or crush it with U/F+4. The same goes for
     any other low. If you think they're going to do a TC move that isn't
     mid, most of the time you can beat it out with a simple hopkick or d/f+2
     or even another d/f+1. Even though 1,2 will beat out any highs that they
     may do, it could be in your favor to do d+1,3 if you're expecting a
     high. This will go under their high and CH.

     Some people, realizing you're keeping them in negative frames will
     simply turtle. When this happens you have to start using lows and grabs.
     The only grab that is probably the least helpful in this situation is
     f,f+3+4. Since your opponent is sitting there waiting for an opportunity
     to attack, they're probably also looking out for grabs. If they're good
     and they see the f,f dash, they will most likely break 1+2. The best
     lows are d+4 and d/b+3. Both are quick and give good frames so you're
     still on the offensive.

1 jab - Simply doing a regular 1 jab will result in the same options as
     d/f+1. The difference is that the jab is high. However, it still gives
     +1, so just follow whatever option is the best for the situation.

[f+]2 - Same deal as the two above.

1,2 - Most people fail to realize the 1,2 leaves you at 0. There's only a few
     characters that can straight up beat out or out-prioritize Law if you do
     1,2 jabs immediately after they block a set of 1,2 jabs. Otherwise, the
     majority of the time, it will result in a draw with both characters
     taking jab damage. If your opponent keeps jabbing after a blocked 1,2 or
     doing some move than overpowers your jabs, simply parry.

     If 1,2 hits, however, it's a whole other story. Like I said before, I
     usually do 1,2~DSS if 1,2 hits because there's so many options. They
     can't really BD or anything to get away so they have to guess what
     you're going to do. And if they do BD, DSS f+1 will catch them. Not to
     mention, DSS f+1 will either go under jabs if they try to jab or CH them
     if they try something slower. You don't have to go into DSS but can do a
     simple grab/low/U/F+4 mix-up. It's just as effective.

WS+3 - This gives +1, but since the move automatically goes into DFS,
     cancelling into DSS right away and mixing it up is the best option. If
     your DSS transition is fast enough (which isn't that hard after this
     move), DSS f+1 cannot be beaten out. Mix it up with DSS f+1 and
     DSS (1+3_2+4) grabs and you're good to go.
     

f+1+2~D - Probably the mother of all frame advantage moves for Law. If you
     do the normal version, you get the same options as above. But if you do
     the ~D version, you get an entirely different list of things to do. 
     First, and most importantly, it gives +4 on block. Second, it throws you
     into crouch. There's three things that can happen after it's blocked.

     WS+4 - This will beat out ANYTHING they try and do. It simply cannot be
     interrupted. If you do WS+4, the best thing to do is ~DSS 2. If they
     tried to beat you out and you hit it CH, the DSS 2 will be guaranteed. If
     they ducked, the WS+4 will connect and there's no way they can beat out
     the following DSS 2. If they block, most of the time, they won't try to
     beat out the 2. Either way, the DSS 2 will hit or be blocked and you get
     the options listed above for 2. WS+4~DSS 2 can be interrupted with
     anything 10-frames or less, but if they started doing that mix it up
     with WS+4, parry and that should take care of the problem.

     Slide mix-up - You may be asking yourself, "If they know they're at -4,
     why would they try and attack me?" This is your answer. Since f+1+2~D
     throws you into crouch, you can go immediately into slide mix-up which
     will be talked about soon. If you're quick enough with the slide, it
     makes for a good mix-up for WS+4 since it'll force them to guess low or
     mid if you think they're going to turtle.




3B. Slide Mix-up and the E-slide:
---------------------------------

Slide mix-up is a pretty simple concept. It involves three things: slide,
WS+2 and grabs. There's two different ways you can incorporate the slide
mix-up and both involve knowing how to e-slide.

E-slide - An e-slide, as stated before, is just a really fast slide. The idea
    behind it is to do a slide so fast that your opponent doesn't have time
    to react or so that they have so little time to react that they have to 
    guess, going off of instinct. This simply takes practice.

Slow slide mix-up - There's a few situations where this comes into play. One
    is if you've scared you opponent into turtling so that they don't try to
    attack you while you are doing the slide motion (which from this point on
    will be referred to as Law's CD). You will usually accomplish this by
    nailing them with a couple e-slides and proving that your slide is faster
    than whatever they try to do. In this situation, you want to do a slow CD
    so that they can see the motion of the slide before it comes out. This
    gives them enough time to sweat about it and second-guess themselves.
    If they duck to block the slide, do WS+2 for a juggle.

    Another situation is if your opponent cannot see the slide. You want to
    do it slowly so that you can get the big damage from WS+2.

    The last situation is if your opponent is in such a position where
    they can't beat out anything you can do from slide but they do have
    enough time to block. Just like before, the purpose is to show them the
    motion and make them second-guess themselves.

Fast slide mix-up - This kind of mix-up is used when your opponent likes to
    attack during a slide mix-up. Most of the time, an e-slide will beat out
    or go under whatever it is they're trying to do. However, the point of a
    fast slide mix-up is to do nothing but e-slides so that they don't have
    time to second-guess themselves but have to block on instinct. This is
    really useful if you know what your opponent blocks on reaction. For the
    most part, people will block the slide on reaction so doing a fast CD and
    then a WS+2 is really effective.

Just a note on the CD, sometimes the motion itself will catch people who are
trying to do a low and it will low parry it.

******
Since you have to be in FC to do a slide mix-up, I have compiled a list of
moves that leave you in crouch for prime slide mix-up opportunity.

f+1+2~D - I brushed on the slide mix-up part a little but didn't explain it
     fully. E-slide is a good counterpart to WS+4 because if you're doing a
     correct e-slide, it should be a perfect mix-up. Few things will beat out
     an e-slide from f+1+2~D so it helps in forcing your opponent to turtle.

     You can use either the fast slide mix-up or the slow one depending on
     what you think your opponent likes to do. Sometimes you'll have people 
     attack the slide mix-up if you do a slow version, so in that case switch
     to the fast version.

(U/F_U_U/B)+3 - If you hold D after, you can come out with a slide almost
     immediately when you touch the ground. Doing the backward flip allows
     for a little bit of evasion while coming out with a slide mix-up. Both
     the U and U/F versions are more suited to making your opponent guess.
     Unless your opponent is predicting the flip, it's almost impossible to
     beat out the follow-up 4 (U+3,4, for example). After eating one or two
     of these on CH, your opponent will usually turtle. When this happens, do
     either the U or U/F version and then go into slide mix-up. Usually you
     want to do a fast slide mix-up, but depending on how hard they are
     turtling, you may want to do a slow one.

U/B+4 - The timing is a little tricky to get down because you have to wait a
     couple extra moments after Law hits the ground before you can come out
     with a slide, but this is used for catching your opponent trying to 
     pitbull. That's why I only listed the backwards version. Sometimes, if
     you whiff this people will try and rush you and they'll eat a CH slide.
     Since this takes you quite a distance, you're left in a perfect position
     to do so. There may be times where a WS+2 may connect in which case you
     might want to use it.

d+1 - Most of the properties of this move were discussed earlier in this FAQ,
     but one that was left undiscussed was the fact that you can stay in
     crouch by hold D. This move is a pure guessing game for both players.
     On hit it's 0 and throws the opponent in crouch so both of you are in
     the exact same position. A simple FC 1 will usually keep people from
     attacking but it's risky because if you get too predictable your
     opponent may low parry your jab for a juggle. However, the reverse may
     happen as well. It may be them doing FC 1 trying to stop you from
     attacking. Either way, just try to get them to turtle after it hits and
     go for a slide mix-up. I would recommend a fast slide mix-up. You can
     also do the same with d+4 but it actually gives you negative advantage
     on hit (not near as much as f,f+4) though most people don't realize it
     or won't risk attacking for fear of the follow-up flip. If that's the
     case, go for a fast slide mix-up.

FC 1_d/b+1 - This is a good medium for slide mix-up because this is one of 
     the easiest moves to stop someone from attacking. If you nail someone CH
     with this, you definitely get a couple frames. Most people realize this
     and don't attack for fear that they're going to run into something for a
     CH. Why not go into a slide mix-up? If you do an e-slide immediately
     after nailing one of these, most people don't even see it coming. 

b+2,3,d+4 - I would not recommend this in any way, shape or form, but I
     figured I would at least mention it. You should never really be doing
     this string period but if you do somehow get to that point, hold D after
     the d+4 and you'll stay in crouch.

******

A final note for slide mix-up: if you nail a slide, just get up and go into
the mix-up again. If you nail a slide, a rising 3 is guaranteed. But only if
you think it will kill them would you want to do it. Why not go for another
slide mix-up? Much more damage is possible and you can rise long before your
opponent can.




3C. Oki - Keeping Them on the Ground:
-------------------------------------

Law has basic oki set-ups, nothing complex. If you want crazy oki, go play a
character like Ling. I'll break this into three categories: Techrolling, 
rolling away or towards, and staying on the ground.

Techrolling - Luckily for Law, he has the slide. Slide can be used as a tech
     catch but there's some basic things you should know before you try.
     First is that there is a certain distance that your opponent will have to
     land at in order for the slide to connect. Second, depending on that 
     distance, the speed of your slide may very. If they're farther or closer
     than perfect slide distance, you may have to do the CD a little slower
     than you normally would in order for it to track properly.  

     You can also play guessing games. If you're close enough, I would 
     recommend always doing f+1+2~D because it gives you the sweet mix-ups 
     discussed earlier and it's incredibly hard to beat out. You can also do 
     grab/b+3 mix-ups. Usually people will start to duck if you throw out a 
     grab every time and mix the grabs up well enough to the point where they
     can't break them consistently. If this happens, start throwing out b+3's
     to catch them. b+3, for the most part, is too fast to see on reaction, 
     so if they duck, it should catch. If they break your grabs consistently,
     just stick with f+1+2~D or switch to quick moves such as d/f+1.

Rolling away or towards - Usually people won't do this against Law because he
     gets a lot of damage off of it. If they are in the Face-Up/Feet-Towards
     or Face-Down/Feet-Away positions and roll, you can get junkyard~DSS 3.
     The b+2 will pick them up and you know the rest from there. If they are
     in one of the other two positions, do f,f+2,1,3 and that should all
     connect.

Staying on the ground - Most of the time, people will just lie on the ground,
     roll to one side and then stand or roll away. Sometimes they'll just
     stand straight up. It all depends on the situation. One of the reasons
     that people try to get up as quick as they can when facing Law is
     his slide does quite a good chunk of damage and if you're fast enough,
     it's hard to get out of if you don't try and get up right away. Most of
     the time d/b+3 or d+1 is guaranteed if they stay on the ground, but we
     want to maximize the amount of damage we can get, right? The best 
     position for Law to have his opponent in is Face-Down/Feet-Towards or
     Face-Up/Feet-Away. This is because d/b+3 or d+1 is usually guaranteed.
     If they try to roll away, they can usually get out of it, but then you
     can switch to doing f,f+2,1,3 for more damage. The worst thing that they
     can do is try and stand straight up from that position because of
     junkyard.

     If you think that your opponent is going to stand while in one of the
     aforementioned positions, do junkyard. It will catch them standing and
     they will be stuck in BT. All of junkyard will connect and you can
     finish the juggle with any standard juggle finisher in the juggles
     section. The weird thing about junkyard hitting a BT opponent is that as
     long as you do a juggle that is more than one hit, it flips them around
     and you can finish with any standard juggle as if you launched normally.
     This is MASSIVE damage. You can also do d+1, it will also catch them
     rising and the follow-up 3 is guaranteed.




3D. The BT Game:
----------------

Law's BT game, in my opinion, is really good, especially with the new BT 2,2
they gave him. There's only two ways you should ever go into BT for a mix-up:
One is 2,2 and the other is d/b+2. Though you can go into BT from b+3, it's
not that useful because they are pushed so far away that nothing will reach.
Sometimes you can get them to run into BT 2,2, but that's only if they're
stupid.

If either d/b+2 or 2,2 hits, they CANNOT beat out BT 2,2 with ANYTHING. This
is good to know for those who like to try and attack after you nail 2,2. When
you go into BT, only mix-up BT 2,2 with BT d+3. A lot of people, when Tekken 5
first came out, said that BT d+4 was a decent mix-up with BT 2,2. The problem
is, that's only true if your opponent tries to GUESS what you're going to do
instead of watching to SEE what you're going to do. BT d+4 is considerably
slower than BT 2,2 so as long as you block high and wait for BT d+4, it will
never catch. This we all know now.

If 2,2 is blocked, it is unsafe especially since you're in BT and they CAN
beat out BT 2,2 with just about anything. However, this is where BT d+3 comes
in as a savior. BT d+3 will beat out just about anything other than the 
generic d+1_FC 1 jab. This means that you're not going to eat any high damage
JS. However, be very wary of this because some people may begin to figure it
out and just let you whiff the BT d+3 and punish. Luckily, BT d+3 has decent
recovery time, so you shouldn't eat many JS. But then again, they may even
begin to low parry it, in which case keep fainting with BT 2 unless you're
absolutely positive they won't go low.

I usually use this BT game in two situations: I block something that's -10
and 2,2 is the most damage I can get or parry~DSS 2,2. I almost ALWAYS do
DSS 2,2 after a regular parry. The idea is to get people so annoyed with the
BT d+3 poke that they either start low parrying or blocking, in which case
you do BT 2,2. 

PRACTICE SEEING IF BT 2 CONNECTS!! This is incredibly important. If you can't
see if BT 2 connects and then finish it, you will be in a world of hurt if
you guess wrong. There is plenty of time to watch and see if BT 2 connects
and then finish with the second 2, it just takes practice. The only time you
should ever finish BT 2,2 is when they block the BT 2 and you think they're
going to attack. By now, most people know that you can delay the second 2 for
a really long time so they won't try and punish the first one. But every now
and again people get antsy and you have to remind them that you can still do
a second hit.

If you nail BT 2,2, usually if you run up d/b+3 is guaranteed. You have to get
up incredibly fast to block it and that happens so rarely, I'm still not sure
if it's possible 100% of the time. If you nail BT d+3, it gives you a frame
or so, so if they try and attack you can do something like WS+4 or WS+2 and
it should beat whatever they do out since BT d+3 pushes a decent distance
away. And if they turtle you can go into slide mix-up.




3E. Law as a Pitbull:
---------------------

Law is an excellent pitbull because of all of his quick, powerful strikes 
such as 1,2,3 or qcf+1,2,1,2. He has a relatively easy time keeping his
opponent in disadvantage so continuing a barrage of jabs, quick lows and
grabs is fairly easy to do.

The downside of this style with Law is that he still retains his SS problems
from T4. The majority of his SS catching tools are slow. b+3 definitely
helped in that area, but it's still a major weakness. If people catch on to
your flow and start SSing, you better be ready to throw some b+3's or
f+1+2~D's to catch it.




3F. Law as a Turtle:
--------------------

Law is also an excellent turtle. His fast jabs and kicks can also be used to
stop anyone from trying to turn it around and put Law in frame lockdown. His
parry keeps people at bay since it leads to guaranteed damage and cannot be
chickened or escaped. And he also gets massive juggle damage if he low
parries or guesses right when he blocks.

The downside to this is that it almost completely eliminates slide mix-up
which is arguably the biggest part of Law's game. Grabs are practically
useless considering that your opponent has to turtle in order for you to get
the time you need to throw a grab out. If Law is the one turtling, he cannot
effectively do that. Slow moves are not a good option either considering that
your opponent will most certainly be using fast jabs and kicks to prevent you
from inflicting massive CH damage on them.




3G. Putting It All Together:
----------------------------

Law can neither be a true pitbull or a true turtle. He must have a little of
both. He is probably a more effective turtle when he uses pitbull tactics to
bait his opponent into CHs.

Law, like most other characters, requires a flow of sorts. You have to be
good at predicting what your opponent is going to do so that you can respond
accordingly. Law has many weapons, so know them and your opponent inside and
out and you will make Law very dangerous.




<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<II4. guaranteed Follow-ups and Wall Stuns>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This section is a list I have compiled of all the guaranteed follow-ups that
are possible when a certain event occurs. These are not juggles in the normal
sense but rather moves that are just guaranteed in certain situations. I did
not include strings that should hit (such as 1,1,2) that are guaranteed if the
first hit connects, connects CH, etc.

CH 1,2,3 - If you hit 1,2,3 CH it'll knock them away. This is probably not
     news to you. What may be news is that e-slide is guaranteed afterwards.
     They can escape it by rolling back but it won't always work and, yes,
     this applies if they techroll. It's a tech-catch.

CH u/f+1 - As stated before, you can get as much as 4,3 after this.

f+1+2~D - Just like it always has, if this move hits non-CH they'll flop
     backwards and be stunned on the ground momentarily. Well, now that you
     can go into crouch and recover faster, e-slide is guaranteed.

BT 1 - Very slow, but if it connects, b+2 is guaranteed. There are a couple of
     options they have. If they try to do any move BT, they will be turned
     around but b+2 will hit CH. In that case, the b+2,3 is guaranteed. They
     can also do a grab. If this happens, they will still eat the b+2 but it
     will turn them around and they can block the 3. Luckily, they can't low
     parry it. If they don't try to do anything, b+2 will hit and leave them
     in BT in which case d+2,3 is most definitely the best option because
     there's only one way to escape it and that's doing the grab. If they do
     this, simply duck after b+2 and punish their grab with WS+2.

DSS f+1 - If they don't do the pop-up (hold F after it hits), run-up and
     d/b+4 is guaranteed.

1,...,2,f+2,1+2 - As with DSS f+1, if they do not do the spring-up, d/b+4 is
     guaranteed.

CH WS+3 - You can get CH WS+3~DSS 3 but it's somewhat difficult and DSS f+1
     does a little more damage and gives better follow-ups.


d/b+4 - At least d/b+3 is guaranteed. If you're opponent is too slow, slide is
     definitely the better option.


CH WS+4 - As mentioned before, ~DSS 2 is guaranteed.




<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<II5. Punishing>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The most detailed compilation of punishing knowledge is currently being
assembled here:

It's a thread titled "Law - unsafe attack punishing guide of doom" in the
Marshall Law forums where we are working on listing every move that is
punishable with every character and by what. At the time of this FAQ we have
10 characters done. I will update this FAQ once we have every character done.

If you want specifics on a certain character or move, that's where you should
go. However, I will outline briefly what punishing is and what you would
normally use.

Punishing implies one of two things: Either a move is being punished after it
has been blocked or a move is being punished after it has whiffed. For moves
that whiff you must use your best judgement and use a move that you believe
will connect before your opponent recovers. Most of the time you should go
something quick like 1,2/2,2/hopkick. Hopkick is, by far, the fastest non-CH
JS that Law has, so use that to your advantage.

As far as blocking a move and punishing goes, you must also use your best
judgement. This is more a trial and error thing than whiff-punishing because
whiff-punishing depends on range, whether you where in the middle of some
move, etc. When you block a move, range may still be a factor but you are 
given a set amount of frames for recovery to work with. More often than not,
there are ten different types of punishers that you will use:

1,2 or 1,1,2 - These are your quick jabs. If one hits, the rest is guaranteed,
     so if there's a move that is -9 or -8 on block, this is your punisher.

2,2 - This is the idle punisher for -10 or -11.

b+2 - Usually only used in situations where a move has bad recovery but is
     relatively safe because of distance, such as Paul's qcf+2.

4,3 or f+4,3 - f+4,3 is a tad bit slower than 4,3. Both of these you would
     use in the same situations as 2,2 and considering that more damage is
     possible because of BT mix-ups off of 2,2, it's all preference.

hopkick (u/f+4) - This is your quick JS punisher. Generally, d/f+2 will
     punish in the same situations, but hopkick is a couple frames faster.

WS+2 and WS+4 - If a move is low or throws you into crouch, these are the two
     punishers you will use. One is quick, the other is slow but launches.

U/F+4 - This is the big damage launcher that you will use when you block
     moves with horrible recovery.

******

Law gets a guaranteed juggle when he low parries a move. He can always get a
hopkick off of either low parry, but he can get U/F+4 (and consequently,
U/F+4,3) off of a low kick parry for massive damage. See the juggles section 
for more information on what the best juggle is.




<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<II6. Character Specific Match-ups>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

If you visit the Marshall Law forums on tekkenzaibatsu.com, we have quite a
few character threads already done, so if you have questions, right now that
is the place to go. Eventually, in future updates, I hope to have this
section complete with every character. If you're having trouble against
certain characters, just go onto the boards and ask in the respective thread.

Note that these sections describe the overall match-up of the two characters.
In other words, it's theory fighting; comparing two characters on paper. If
one player is skillful enough compared to the other at the game in general, 
there's no reason that, say, Kuma won't beat Law.




6A. Anna Williams:
------------------

One thing to keep in mind with Anna is that her punishers aren't spectacular.
In fact, nothing about her really is. She has good jabs and Anna players will
use those, but her launcher-punisher capability isn't all that good. For
example, she can get some damage but she can't launch you if you do one of
Law's punishable flips (like d+2,3, for example).

This can aid you a great deal if you're a player who likes to gamble with
moves like d+2,3. In this match it's not near as much of a risk as with
other match-ups.

Don't take this the wrong way, however. She does have a good juggle game and
her wall game is superb as well. Her elbow is still as good as it was in Tag.
Her poking is also very good, just like her sister's.

She lacks in the grab deparment and the mix-ups. A lot of her mix-ups don't
really yield a ton of reward and she has a LOT of punishable moves. This I
would advise learning. She does have a lot of new moves, meaning they changed
her style somewhat. So if you're used to what she was like in Tag, better
learn her a little and get used to her. Really, if you just take a little
time to learn her ins and outs she shouldn't be too tough of a match-up.




6B. Asuka Kazama:
-----------------

Keep on her ASS!! Seriously, stay in her grill. She has SOME tools to deal
with a good pitbull but keep at it with the quick mids (d/f+1, hopkick, etc.).
Her regular 1 jab is slower than 8-frames so she'll lose the jabbing game real
quick. Be careful for WS+3 set-ups or you'll be eating major damage. For
example, after blocking a WS+3 be careful because if you try to hit her right
afterwards you may be eating a CH 4, one of her rare moves that is decently
fast. Also, beware of WS+3 on its own. If it hits you she can do a good 
chunk. Same goes with moves such as f+2. Test out stuff and make sure you
know when to punish moves. You don't want an Asuka player to know you have 
no idea how to punish her moves.

The only thing you have to worry about when you pitbull her is just running
into stuff. A good Asuka should be able to predict you if you're blatantly
obvious about it. This is where baiting comes into play. Just try to bait
moves like her 4 and 2 so that you can punish her for trying.




6C. Baek Doo San:
-----------------

Baek has a big problem with predictability. Most good Baek players will get
into a rhythm with him fast so they can pressure, the same goes with Hwoarang
players. But a lot of Baek's pressuring options take a moment to start up 
and have predictable pauses and such in the middle of certain strings that
will knock him out of it. Again, much like Hwoarang. The difference is, Baek
doesn't rely on stance switches of any sort so his predictability increases.
d+2 and d/b+1 are your friends for stopping any flamingo-pitbulling he tries.

This isn't to say he's bad, in fact a good Baek player is something to watch
out for. But getting around him is rather easy. Is mostly the same strategy
as with Lee: turtle and don't duck. The only good low that Baek has that does
any major damage is d/b+4. It's hard to see at first but the more you see it
the more you get used to blocking it on reaction. And if you block that, WS+2
all day.

The major problem Baek will give Law, and anyone for that matter, is he has 
the best SS in the game with b+3. His b+3 goes into flamingo stance but 
since you don't have to press a button and then N, you go into a SS instantly.
Why is this so good? Because combine it after a regular SS and you get a
double SS. And he can SS AFTER he does b+3! So you have a possible triple SS
on your hands that's relatively fast and a good Baek player WILL do this and
WILL launch you while you are BT. And with Law still having some SS problems,
it can be a tough match. This is why it's not a good idea to rush a lot.
You'll get SS'd all day. Remember that he can't block in flamingo stance, 
though.

It's not too tough of a match-up for Law if you play it right.




6D. Bruce Irvin:
----------------

Bruce has a CH problem of sorts. You can pitbull him to a point but a lot of
his damage will come off of CH. His grab game isn't really that good and his
lows still suck. This means that you should turtle and not duck. Keep in
mind a LOT of Bruce's moves are punishable and those that aren't are not 
going to yeild a lot of damage for him so he pretty much HAS to take some
risk in order to do anything amazing. For the most part, right after you 
block something, go on the offensive for a few seconds then get back into
the shell. If you're good at breaking grabs this shouldn't be a hard match-up
at all.




6E. Bryan Fury:
---------------

Bryan is beasty. That's all there is too it. He is most definitely top-tier.
He will punch you in the grill if you don't watch out. <--- Thanks to Bill 
for pointing this out.

First and foremost, the one move you'll see a good Bryan player use the most
is b+1. The move is EXTREMELY good. On hit it'll give him a juggle and on 
block it gives him frames. Hell, I've seen bad players use only b+1 and win.
It's a pure guessing game. If you think he's going to do another b+1, 
either rush and attack or do a couple BDes and get the hell out of there.
If you think he's going to attack either parry, block or FC+1 (since b+1 on
block puts you into FC) and pray he's going to do a high or relatively slow
mid.

Beware of punching Bryan. This is probably a match-up more built for kicks.
If Bryan does his PP, it'll lead to nasty stuff. Much like Law's PP, after
Bryan successfully parries a punch he must follow-up by pressing 2 or nothing
will happen. If he does press 2, he'll either do a f,f+2 or a d/f+2, 
depending on which arm he parries. Just a note, if Bryan hits you with a
f,f+2 he gets b,b+4. Same applies after the f,f+2 follow-up after a PP. Just
remember that he can stop any rushing game down in its tracks. Not to
mention, with the addition of Bryan's new f,f+1+2 throw and an easier, faster
way of doing his old FC,d/f,d,d/f+1+2 throw, Bryan's throw game is now elite.
You're just going to have to learn to see the set-ups.

Also beware of his wall game. First rule: DO NOT TECH ROLL WHEN YOU HIT THE
GROUND AFTER 1,2,1!! Any good Bryan player will do 1,2,1 once you hit the 
wall. Why? Because it GUARANTEES d/f+3 afterwards. If you tech, it'll track
you and you CANNOT block it. This means if you tech roll after a 1,2,1 you're
going to get re-launched. It sucks, but you're going to have to just sit
there and eat the d/f+3 and then try to get up. It's the easiest and least 
painful way. And don't feel bad if you get to the wall quick, Bryan's juggles
are tailor-made to get you there.

What should you do then? It's pretty much a 50/50 game. If either character
makes a mistake, the other can take advantage in a heartbeat. Try to out-
guess him. Use slide mix-up a lot. Use the parry a lot. b+1 CAN be parried by
regular parry but NOT PP. Good thing to know. Though I do advocate the
wholesale use of d+2, this is a match-up you might want to backoff on that
move with. b+1 and a lot of Bryan's other nasty moves tend to just go around
it; whether it be crushing it, out-prioritizing it or just plain making it 
whiff. Also learn to see d/f+3. It's properties on block are very similar
to Law's d/b+4. If you block it you can go make a sandwich, come back and
still be able to punish. It's not something good Bryan players use a lot but
if they know you can't see it on reaction, you'll be eating a lot of damage 
soon enough.

If anything swings the tide, it's probably the fact that Law's parry is much
better than Bryan's. Law can win a match without punches, Bryan can't do it
without mids/highs. Other than that, good luck.




6F. Christie Monteiro/Eddy Gordo:
----------------------

First off, there is a minor difference between Eddy and Christie. It has to
do with their arm and leg length. Eddy has slightly longer legs giving him
the edge in juggles and he has a slightly longer throw range.

But moving on to general strats, both have very good juggles and grab game.
(From now on I'll just say "him" because I like Eddy more than Christie.)
He also has very good mix-ups. He's just another one of those characters that
if you don't know their movelist you're going to get eaten alive. There were
quite a bit of properties that were changed with moves that come out of his
handstand and relax position (laying propped up on elbows). Just one example,
4~3 out of relax now leads to a juggle.

The main thing to beat handstand is to perform a well-timed b+2,3,4 and it
will juggle. Relax is a little more difficult because you can't get a juggle,
but there are numerous ways to hit him out of it. d+1, d/b+3 and d+4 just to
name a few. When he gets in that stance, or you think he will, it's best to
BD to a safe distance and do a slide. Remember, he can't block in either of
those stances.

Another thing to be wary of is his SS games and moves that sidestep. b+2 is
one of his best moves. It's mid and has a sidestep built into it. This makes
it extremely useful. And with Law's already bad SS problems, this adds to it.
He also has crazy mix-ups off of his SS+4, which include grabs and launchers.
There's also SS+2 which gives a little advantage to Eddy and can set up for
him very nicely.

There are two important things to remember about Eddy. One, his only low
launcher comes out of relax position so everything else will be a poke. SS+4
I do consider a poke to it leads to mix-ups. Second, he doesn't have quite
the launcher list that Law has. He has trouble punishing the very punishable
flips (such as d+2,3) with a launcher. His big launchers will come CH or from
mix-up games so as long as he's not guessing you 100% correctly every time
you shouldn't be seeing yourself in the air a whole lot.

Because of the unorthodox nature of Eddy, it can be a weird match-up, to say
the least. Just remember that Law can still do more damage in the air and has
a better wall and grab game. Speed is also on Law's side. This would be a
match where I HIGHLY advise learning Eddy/Christie so you're not blind-sided.
If you know the character, you should be fine.




6G. Craig Marduk:
-----------------

Craig is a tough match if you don't know what you're doing. A lot of players
lose to Craig because they underestimate him. 

First and foremost, prepare for the tackle. If you haven't learned, practice
breaking his tackle with 1+2. If you can't get it consistently, you're going
to be hurting. When he goes into his Vale Tudo Stance (VTS for short, the 
stance he's in when he performs a tackle) flipkick(U/F+4) is your best
friend. If he does the low option or the tackle, it'll juggle to you'll get
good damage. If he does any of the other options (4 or 1, say), even if it
hits you he won't get a juggle so you should be okay. If your timing is good
it'll be a CH. There's other, more safe options, like b+2 or the like that
will just knock him out of VTS or force him to come out of it and block but
I like risky and getting big damage.

When he actually tackles you, there's only three things you can do: nothing,
1 or 2. Craig has four options when he tackles you: 1, 2, 1+2 or 3+4. If you
press nothing, it'll automatically break the 1+2 or 3+4 options. If Craig 
does a 1, you'll have to press 2 when the punch hits to break it. Vice versa
if he presses 2.

Another thing to watch out for is Craig's FC,d/f+4. If this move hits, it's
a pure guessing game for him. He can either do WS+4 or another FC,d/f+4. The
stun that FC,d/f+4 gives is so big that you really can't hope to beat out any
option he has so don't even try. The best thing to do is to block high and
try and see the FC,d/f+4. If you block that move it's WS+2 all day long. You
can low parry it too for even more damage if you're feeling skillful.

Keep in mind that Marduk's juggle game is a bit different now. With his new
air throws and strings he can do some massive damage and get you in weird
set-ups if you're not careful. With Law's SS problems, beware of d/b+1+2.
This move SSes on its own which makes it dangerous but if you're playing a 
good Craig, they'll do a manual SS right before it so that it'll rotate even
farther around you. If you block it, though, DON'T FORGET TO PUNISH! You 
can't get a buttload of damage but you can get some things. IF you let this
move go unpunished they WILL abuse it and it's not something you want them to
be abusing. You can punish with a variety of things, the best being either
dash, 4,3 or dash, 2,2. Depending on the range, you can sometimes get f+1+2.
A little risky though.

Just keep running around hunting for flipkicks, hopkicks and d/f+2s and you
should be all right. Keep him off-balance with stuff like d+2, b+2. If he
goes into the shell (which a Marduk might do) be sure to do a lot of f+1+2.




6H. Devil Jin:
--------------

As the first Mishima on the list that has the "old school" Mishima feel, 
there's a strategy that works for a lot of characters but Law in particular
that will help your fight against a Mishima a lot: d+2.

There's a good reason for this. Because they changed the generic Mishima
wgf to high, that means it suffers from the same properties as all highs. 
d+2 is a HIGH crush. Keep this in mind at all times. In previous versions of
Tekken ewgf was used as a pressuring tool. No longer is this the case. Sure, 
you can pressure to a point but if someone does a high crush or a tech crouch
move they don't have to worry about eating a CH ewgf. This USED to be on the
minds of anyone who was going up against a Mishima. The reason d+2 is so good
against Mishimas is that not only will it crush ewgf but it's also fast as
hell, so your chances of beating out the other 5 or so options they have are
pretty good.

This doesn't mean that you should use d+2 stupidly. DJ can make you pay big
for any mistake. His juggles are very similar to Tag Jin's juggles and, if
anything, are stronger. His CD mix-ups are still very strong and he'll juggle
you if he hits a ewgf, hellsweep (CD+4) or cancels into a WS+2. (Which if you
know anything about Mishimas is something that only takes practice and is
extremely effective against chronic duckers.) Also, his b,f+2,1,2 is still
very good.

The idea is to keep DJ off-balance with d+2. Don't allow him to even think
about CDing. If you run up and do a d+2, you'll crush an ewgf if he tries it
and if he does something else you should be able to beat it out. If you whiff
the d+2, no big worries. Hold D for a moment if you think he might try to 
punish and you should be able to duck all of his major launchers in which
case you can punish with a WS+4 or WS+2, depending on the situation. Just
be careful with d+2 because it can be low-parried and DJ WILL get massive
damage from it.

Remember that this strategy involves slide, slide and SLIDE. If you nail a
d+2, go straight into slide mix-up. If they try to attack you, WS+2 right 
away, don't even go for a mix-up. NOTHING can beat out WS+2 after d+2 hits.
DJ can punish both slide and WS+2, but punishing slide is MUCH easier than
punishing WS+2. It is possible for DJ to punish WS+2 with ewgf but the timing
is really tight and your opponent would have to be on the ball in order to
get it consistently. Keep those two things in mind as well.




6I. Feng Wei:
-------------

This is, by far, my most hated character in this game. He's so stupidly good
and stupidly easy to use that I've come to the decision that he's just an all
around stupid character.

First reason? He's so damn safe. One of his best launchers is a LOW. Which I
will warn you of right now. SS+4. Learn to stop Feng from SSing. Not only
does Law already have a SS problem as is, he'll be going against a character
whose moves invoke him to SS. There's a couple ways around this move. One is
to simply watch for and try to predict it and parry it when you see it. Did
I mention that the only thing you can punish SS+4 with is WS+4? Yea, dumb.
Oh, and it goes under highs and some mids as well.

The best way to counter Feng's SSing is to just SS with him. Also, just try
to stay away from linear moves. Other than jabs, use a lot of f+1+2s, b+3s,
regular standing 4, etc. You can also use d+1 to track his SSing and d/b+3
can also be of some use, but remember that d/b+3 can be CH by Feng's b+1
whereas Law's d+1 cannot.

Another reason he's so dumb is because of moves such as b+1. A high that, if
not faster than 8-frames, definitely has mad priority over other moves. It's
moves like that that make his mix-ups so good. And he has a lot of them. Too
many to list here so you'll just have to experiment and find ways around
stuff. I play a LOT against Feng and I still am yet to get him down, though
he is a lot less painful now that I know how he plays.

A general strategy against Feng is poke, poke, poke and then hunt. Basically,
I do a lot of d+2s, d/f+1s, d+4s, d/b+3s, etc. until I feel I've gained 
enough ground to hunt for a d/f+2 or U/F+4. I also use slide a lot. I can't
ever throw that mix-up away.

A final note, learn what Feng moves you CAN punish. He doesn't have a lot of
them but those he does are big hitters so make him pay for trying such
foolishness. This is definitely a hard match-up, though, no doubt. 



6J. Ganryu:
-----------

Ganryu is a tough match-up if you don't know him very well. That being said,
learn his movelist. They've given him some new goodies and if you don't know
what they are you're going to get slaughtered.

I'll start off by saying that the main weakness of Ganryu is his lows. He
still has the awesome, quick, low sweep kick but all of his lows that lead 
to juggles and mix-ups are slow. Learn to low parry them on reaction and then
punish with u/f+4 (hopkick). If nothing else, at least learn to block them on
reaction and punish with ws+4.

On to his strengths. Probably Ganryu's main strength is his juggling to
mix-up capability. His juggles are very strong and his mix-ups are incredibly
good. Most Ganryu players will end juggles with his new 1+2 and try to 
destroy you from there. If you guess wrong, you're going to eat a lot of
damage. No real way to help you pick the best route; it'll be a situational
thing.

Also watch out for his headbutt. It's much like Feng's b+1 where it's so fast
that it'll beat out and out-prioritize a lot of things. If it hits CH, 
Ganryu gets even more than Feng would. It has the same problem, though, in
that it's high.

Other than that, you should just watch out for his big hitters. Ganryu has
a lot of new strings and moves that do monster damage but are just as 
punishable. This is why I advise going through the movelist. Make sure you
know what these are. You don't want a Ganryu knowing he can do anything to
you and not take damage.

Law has the advantage but don't underestimate Ganryu.




6K. Heihachi Mishima:
---------------------

First, and this is just basic info, he has only two mids out of CD. CD+1 and 
CD,f+4,4 (the CD version of WS+4,4). He also has f,n,d,d/f+3 and f,n,d,D/F+3
but I wouldn't worry about those too much because they're REALLY slow and 
they can be sidestepped really easily. Good rule of thumb is if you see him
jump in the air, sidestep. Second, NEITHER of those are safe. Yes, NEITHER 
of them. This puts that guessing game in favor of the opponent (most of the 
time, but in Law's case it definitely does) because his first hellsweep won't
knockdown so you, in essence, have to guess wrong TWICE to take big damage 
if he goes low. This is if you allow Hei to even do a CD. He has more mids 
he can do if he does them out of WD, but unless you're a mile away he 
shouldn't be doing them. His new lows suck, in my opinion, and don't give 
him a huge guessing game even if they hit. The only semi-good low they gave 
him was d/b+2 (that little low punch). No good guessing game really comes 
out of it.

The reason a lot of people think Hei is good is because of 2,2~1+2. It's 
completely safe on block and gives at least 50% on hit with a ff+2 follow-up. 
I say at least because if you hold F and do the spring-up it'll juggle you 
for massive damage. 

Want to know how to beat Hei and 2,2~1+2? d+2 a LOT. Do NOT do d+2,3. You 
don't even need it. Remember d+2 crushes highs and is hella fast so it'll 
beat out most mids. Plus it leaves you in crouch for your own juicy mix-up. 
This will kill his CD game because I play a lot against Hei and I have YET 
to see d+2 get hit by ewgf and it'll beat out any other option he has.
And what about WD? You can do the ol' Tag strat of hopkicking but ewgf 
has mad priority over hopkick so you better be with it with your timing. I 
would just d+2. I seriously spam d+2 when I play Hei. There's just not a lot 
he can do about it other than low parry it and that shouldn't happen often 
considering that you should be using it defensively not offensively. If he 
starts catching on and parrying, just do it at irregular intervals. 2,2~1+2? 
Old and busted already. d+2 will crush the first 2 and should beat out the 
1+2 if, say, you're in a situation where you duck the first 2 and notice the 
1+2 coming out. Hell, you can probably duck half the match and make it out 
all right.




6L. Hwoarang:
-------------

Hwoarang is definitely tricky, no two ways about it. If you know what you're
doing with him, he's top-tier material.

The reason that he's so tricky is because, obviously, of his flamingo. He's
got so many ways to get into it, so many options when in it and so many ways
to get out that a lot of the time you're going to be guessing. Easiest way to
get around this? Learn his movelist. Simple as that. Learn the movelist a 
little, see what he can and can't do in certain stances and just be ready to
take advantage of a weakspot.

One reason a lot of people lose to Hwoarang is because they can't tell when
they're in frame disadvantage or not. This is extremely hard to do and you'll
have to be on your toes to try and do it. Law has been given one gift, though,
that helps him greatly with this issue: Parry. Remember, his manual parry
(b+1+3_b+2+4) will parry both punches AND kicks. If you don't know if you can
beat his next attack out with jabs or not but you're pretty certain he's
going to do a mid or high, parry.

d+2 is also your friend in this match-up. When Hwoarang bulldogs, he's going
to throw some jabs and high kicks your ways. d+2 will also beat out some of 
his lows and mids (though not all of them). DO NOT FOLLOW UP WITH 3! A lot
of players, after reading something like this, might think, "Well, if he's
bulldogging and he's throwing a lot of moves out, d+2 should hit CH when I
throw it out." I play against a Bob a lot and, for some strange reason, even
when I stop his bulldogging in its tracks, the d+2 does not register as a CH.
If you're having different results, go for it, but I have long since stopped.

Another thing to watch out for is his WS+4,4. Hwoarang does have a CD and his
WS+4,4 is a safe and incredibly effective tool. I consider it his best move
and I'm sure a lot of Hwoarang players would agree. And to compliment his
CD game he has CD+4 (as well as a very good just-frame version of it) that
will deal you lots of damage if he nails it.

I would say that the overall strategy for playing Hwoarang would be lots of
d+2s, parries and slide mix-ups. If the Hwoarang you're playing is turtling 
a lot, you won't have to worry so much but if you get too aggressive, 
especially when he's in your grill, you're going to have to play it safe. Law
still has a slight edge, but not much.





6M. Jack-5:
-----------

Jack can be a really hard match-up if he's put into the right hands. His
juggles are good, his grab game is awesome, his lows and mix-ups are good
and he has weird properties that can mess with some characters.

He has two main problems: One, he's the biggest bastard in the game and, two,
he's on the slow side. I would actually tack on to that the fact has has no
parry or counter of any kind.

That being said, use this to your advantage. Jack has a lot of high crush
moves so watch out when you try and rush him down with jabs and such. This is
one of those instances of weird properties. If Jack block 1,2,3, the 3 will
magically miss. Don't ask why, it's just the way it is. It'll all hit 
normally if you nail the 1,2 (CH or not) in that the 3 is guaranteed if it's
CH and he will have to block the 3 if it's not but if the 1,2 gets blocked,
then for some reason the 3 will miss. The sucks because if the Jack has good
reflexes he can punish with a launcher.

Also something of note. Be careful with WS+2. Jack gets free d/f+2 and it
hurts. A lot. However, he does have trouble punishing the slide, so that is
still very much game.

Another weakness, but a strength in part, is Jack's punishable moves. He does
have a lot of them but they're a risk to take every now and then. Most of 
Jack's punishable moves can be punished badly, but if they hit... I don't 
think I need to finish that sentence.

Law has the advantage, but you have to be smart with it. Jack will make you
pay for your mistakes.




6N. Jin Kazama:
---------------

They've toned down Jin a lot from T4, so you don't have to worry about the
JFLS or 2,1 BS that he had. He's still powerful though so you'll have to 
watch out.

Jin now has a new stance, b+1, that can be cancelled and done again. It looks
like a retarded movement. Depending on the timing of the cancels you can 
actually go backward, forward or stay stationary with these cancels. His 
options are pretty wild out of it, though. He can do a quick f,f move such as
f,f+2 because cancelling the b+1 buffers a f for him. This means that he can 
also hit you with a quick f,f,f+3 that you have to watch out for. It's the 
generic jump kick that's mid and gives great advantage for the person using 
it. The weakness of it is that it can be SSed very easily. He can also do a 
quick CD right after it that will become very effective for him if you begin
turtling when you see b+1. The best thing to do is something like f,f+2,1 at
long range or a quick d/f+1 or f+1+2 if you think he'll run into it.

Jin is a poking whore still with some great new additions. Not much you can
do about this but parry and try and CH him. d+2 helps in your struggle as
does moves like d+1,3.

The weakness of Jin is that he has no safe juggle starter that juggles non-CH.
So he has to be ready for you to make a mistake to get big damage. Learn to
punish moves like CD+1, u/f+4, etc. and you'll be okay.

His WD is a little different from the other Mishimas because he doesn't have
the standard ewgf that the others do. Instead, his CD+2 is a hook fist that's
high and his CD+1 is now a mid launcher. He doesn't have a hellsweep but his
CD+4 is still a sweep that will juggle. d+2 is most definitely your friend
when dealing with his CD/WD options. It'll beat out anything he has out of 
CD/WD easy and it'll crush CD+2, so no worries. Try and watch out for CD+4 in
particular because if you block that move you can get major damage.

If you just try and poke him back and hunt for CH while he's poking you, you
should be okay. Don't forget about slide and f+1+2 mix-ups. They will help in
this match-up.
 



6O. Julia Chang:
----------------

There's three things you need to beat Julia: SS, SS and SS. Plus the
occasional SW. Again, d+2 is your friend in this match. She has a lot of
decent mids and lows but most of them are slower than d+2 and her big-damage
highs will get crushed. She has been given a few new tools to deal with her
SS problem but it's still definitely there. 

She also has a good grab game with her still awesome qcb,f+2 grab. There are
many set-ups for this so you'll have to learn to see them and break 1+2 when
appropriate. She can break turtles in a heartbeat with this so just keep
poking with the d+2.

Just make sure to play it SAFE. She can deal out f,f+1s all day if you keep 
whiffing and a CH 1,2,1 will end your up-until-then good day.




6P. Kazuya Mishima:
-------------------

Kazuya is the same as the other two "old school" Mishimas in that the basic
strategy is d+2. The problem with Kazuya (and which is why, in my opinion,
he's the best of the three) is that he has a lot of good mids that will hurt
a LOT if he nails them. Especially on CH.

This means that you're going to have to watch how much you whiff things. You
may get away with whiffing an occasional d+2 but if you do it too much, he'll
juggle you for big damage. Same goes with timing. If you get too predictable
with the d+2 he'll either CH you with one of his big damage mids or he'll
parry it in which case he'll get a good chunk as well.

It's not an extremely hard match-up for Law, it's still in his favor but you
will have to play a little more safe.

Keep in mind, and this is for all Mishimas, once you get them in the shell, 
the match is yours. Mishimas are not built for defense anymore. They had
good defense in Tag, but it's not too good now.



6Q. King:
---------

King is tough because, obviously, he has the best damn grab game IN the game.
His set-ups for grabs are endless and it takes knowing King in and out to 
know which break you should use and when. Even then, you're still going to
guess wrong sometimes and eat a lot of damage for it.

He also has a monster juggle game, as far as damage is concerned. If he gets
you in the air, you'll be feeling some major hurt. The upside of this is that
King has a hard time GETTING you in the air. His number one launcher is
hopkick which can be punished with 2,2 or 1,2. Keep making him eat those into
your own mix-ups and soon he'll stop doing it as much.

Learn to see and punish d/b+3. This new low that King has will give you a
hard time if you can't see it coming. It's rather slow so if you get used to
it enough you should be able to block/parry it on reaction. Hell, that's
probably the only move the computer uses with King so if you want practice
with that, just go play the computer for a little while.

King is, by nature, a turtle character. He's been given tools (d+1,N,2 to be
specific) to stop any bulldogging and the fact that most of his damage and
set-ups require either CH or a lot of big whiffs prove this. This means
that you're going to have to watch your step. Slide mix-up is still good but
you'll have to cut back on its use a little because hopkick is an effective
tool for stopping it. The key is to outpoke him (one way of doing this is to
force him to go into the shell a little deeper by predicting and parrying his
d+1) and try and hunt for juggles when you think he'll grab. BE CAREFUL WHICH
LAUNCHER YOU GO FOR! If he goes for a grab and you do a hopkick, if King
happens to be going for a grab that air-grabs, your effort will be for not.

Also be very unpredictable with your kicks. King has a kick reversal that's
unchickenable and does a lot of damage as well as gives him good oki. His
new right punch reversal is something to watch out for but because there's
not a good way to get around it, just ignore it for the most part. As long
as you don't spam right punches I doubt you'll have to ever worry about it. 
It's more for characters like Mishimas.



6R. Kuma:
---------

This match-up isn't tough at all for Law. If you simply pay attention you 
should be able to win this match easily.

That being said, keep in mind that, being a bear, Kuma can dish out a lot of
damage. There's only a couple of key things to worry about. First is watch
out for big damage moves like b,f+2+3. Most of them aren't hard to see coming
but it does take SOME time if you've never fought against Kuma. Second, learn
to punish him. The majority of Kuma's moves are punishable. If you're not
sure what's punishable by what, just keep doing stuff like 1,2 or 2,2 to 
punish and you should be good to go. Learn which moves will give you
launchers, though. You don't want your opponent to think that they can get
away with incredibly risky moves. Lastly, don't fear Hunting (d+3+4). It
looks kind of intimidating, but don't sweat it. Hell, I go for U/F+4 every
time he goes into it because there's not much he can do about it.




6S. Lee Chaolan:
----------------

The basic strategy to use against Lee is: turtle and don't duck. If you have
troubles breaking grabs, this may be a hard match for you but there's a few
reasons I give that strategy. One is that Lee really has no good lows. The
lows he does have are either easy to see coming or do such a small amount of
damage that it's not worth the risk to duck. Second, his grab game is really
crappy. Seriously. His only 1+2 grab is f,f+3+4 and you should be able to see 
that grab coming because of the f,f dash. Other than that, you have a 50/50
chance to break anything he throws out. Third, if you duck, you're risking
half your life bar because of his quick knee launcher (u/f+4), maybe even
more if you're in a wall stage. Lastly, this being the reason to turtle, Lee
can just about out-bulldog anyone. Almost every character has ways of dealing
with pitbulls but no one can match Lee in a straight up pitbull fight. Law is
no exception. If you try to rush down Lee, you're going to eat a lot of
knees, guaranteed.

Consider yourself lucky if you manage to get an infinite stage because, even
though Lee has decent juggles for open-terrain, he can't keep up with Law in
the juggle category. But if you're in a wall stage, try and stay the hell
away from it. It's extremely difficult to do considering the Lee can take you
from one end to the other in no time. Just play it safe.




6T. Lei Wulong:
---------------

This is probably one of the easiest match-ups. Lei didn't have a whole lot
to work with as was and they didn't help him much in T5. His juggles are still
bad, his strings that used to do a lot of damage still don't and his new moves
aren't really all that good.

If you can BD, this match is no problem. Other than running, Lei can only 
catch a good BDer with his Razor Rush and that's only a momentary spurt of
speed. If you can stay a prime slide mix-up distance there's not much the Lei
can do. Law's mix-ups are definitely better, Lei has a lot of punishable stuff
and Lei has to turtle to win anyway so you if you're patient and take your
time it should be a big problem.

If he lays on the ground, slide. If he goes BT, either d+2,3 if you're close
or b+2,3,4 if you're a good distance away. The reason slide is so good against
Lei is that is all but nullifies his stances. He still has generic d/f+2 and
hopkick, like Law, so don't get risky. Play this match very safe and you
should easily come out the winner.




6U. Ling Xiaoyu:
----------------

One of the main reasons Ling is good is because of her Art of Pheonix (AOP)
stance. When she gets into this stance she has a lot of options, the most
annoying of which is ~D. This move makes her doing a little ducking motion
towards the ground. I've seen this move duck some LOWS. It's that good. She
has a lot of quick evasive moves that compliment AOP.

Even though Ling does have some good pokes and decent juggles, the reason she
can beat Law is because she can get around him. She can't match his speed, 
she can't match the damage, she can't match a lot of Law's stuff but she has
the knack of being able to get around, under, over, etc. everything Law has.

This is why she wins, period. When she makes you whiff, she makes you feel
it with damage. That being said, you HAVE to stop AOP. You can do this a few
ways. The easiest is simply poking her to death with d+4 or d/b+3 or
something quick that will knock her out of it. Doing something like d/b+4 or
flipkick isn't TOO bad of an option but remember that those are slow and her
options are faster, not to mention she has rolls that can avoid them if she
sees them.

Use BD to create some space and use slide from a distance. Use f+1+2~D if you
think she's going to run to you to close the gap. U/B+4 is also a good
defensive option. If they try to rush you after you do the backward flipkick,
continue to hold U/B and press 4 again for his High Catapult Kick. It almost
always wins out over whatever they were trying to hit you with.

Just play defensively and keep some space between you and her. A turtle Ling
is a bad Ling so beware, it may be a fake-out.




6V. Marshall Law (Mirror Match):
--------------------------------

This section won't be too big because there's not much to say. You play the
character so you should know his moves.

That being said, just remember that you AND your opponent have SS problems as
well as parries and monster juggles. Don't feel bad if you eat a few slides.
;)

The better player WILL win this match-up.


6W. Nina Williams:
------------------

This match-up is just plain hard for any character in the game. Luckily,
we're not left unarmed.

First thing is first, you're not going to out-poke her. Just stop trying. She
will (1_d/f+1),2,3:1+2 you to death all day long before you know what 
happened. If you don't know what that move is, it's two jabs followed by a 
knee, but if the Nina player is good at it (which isn't hard), if the knee
hits, the 1+2 just-frame will go into a chain grab which you'll have to 
guess the break for. Nasty stuff. If you see those two jabs, don't attack. 
Plain and simple.

To deal with this nastiness, Law has been given parries. PP is somewhat
useful but if you mispredict her, you're going to eat some damage. Use the
regular parry more. It's safer and will parry kicks as well.

Learn to see Wipe the Floor (d,d/f+4). The reason I say this is because it 
gives her oki (which I will explain in a moment) and does good damage, and
you don't want to give her oki. Thank God that it's slow. Don't even try
and low parry it, just block it and punish with WS+2.

The reason I say don't give her oki is because her oki game is KILLER. It's
the reason she wins. A good Nina player will always end a juggle with u/f+1
and the juggle usually consists of d/f+1,2s or d+4,1s. When you're on the
ground, there's three things that she can do. One is Wipe the Floor. This
will catch you if you roll to either side, roll forward or just lay there.
The second is u+4. This will nail you for massive damage is you sit there or
roll forward or backward. Sometimes it'll even catch if you roll to the side,
but not very often. Last is d+4,1. This is for those who try to stand or roll
away to either block wipe the floor/u+4 or trying to get away from those
moves. If this hits, you're re-launched and she gets the whole thing again.
The best option I have found so far is to roll left. Most of the time u+4 
will just whiff you and you may take a little poke damage from d+4 which
isn't too serious. However, wipe the floor will take some serious damage from
you. I'm willing to take the damage once or twice because Nina players
generally seem to get greedy and usually never do wipe the floor more than 
once even if you roll ever single time.

Just a note, in just about any oki situation she gets, d+3+4 is guaranteed, so
don't feel bad if she nails you with that. Also don't forget to learn her
strings. She has a lot of two- or three-hit strings and most have lows in
them so if you start seeing the lows, low-parry and punish. Simple as that.

Otherwise, just play safe and find your openings. Good luck.




6X. Paul Pheonix:
-----------------

Paul is definitely high-risk/high-reward, but if you play him right, it can
be an uphill battle for him.

Paul is one of those characters that you just don't want to whiff against.
You don't have to necessarily turtle, but known your ranges. You're
definitely going to eat a few qcf+2s if you're not careful. It seems like they
almost switched Law's T4 weakness with Paul. Paul has a big problem with
people who SSR. He has tons of stuff to catch people SSing left, but not a
lot for SSR. The moves he does have are slow or deal little damage. You still
have to be wary of them, but if you see an opportunity to SS, do it the RIGHT
way. (Pun most definitely intended.)

There's no real reason to turtle against Paul if you play smart. He does have
a couple of moves to watch out for, though. One is Iron Mountain (IM, or
d+1+2). This is a double-edged sword for Paul. It goes back to the whole
high-risk/high-reward thing. It'll stop any rushdown game in its tracks and
is pretty damn fast. Downside of it is that you get a free d/f+2 or hopkick
if you block it. Doing a little "fake" bulldogging to bait a Paul player into
throwing this out isn't a bad strategy. Most good Paul players will use it
very rarely, but if you block it, make sure you punish it. His jabs are
really good, as well. They seem to have mad priority. Same goes with u/f+3,4.
Those double-jump kicks will kill any high- or low-attack game you have.

The name of the game is baiting when you play Paul. Again, the high-risk
/high-reward thing; a lot of Paul's moves can be punished. If you block a
qcf+2, punish with b+2. If you block a d+4, punish with WS+2. u/f+3,4 with
2,2 or 4,3. It just kind of takes trial and error to figure out what to 
punish with what.

A final note for Paul: Don't sit there and do nothing! Dead serious. Paul has
the tools to break turtles. His grab game is good and so are his lows,
especially falling leaf (d+4:2:1+2). And when you start ducking, you'll start
eating qcf+2s left and right.




6Y. Raven:
----------

Raven is, in many aspects, just like Paul. He's very high-risk/high-reward.

The difference here is that you can dance around Raven and come out hardly
touched. He has big whiff-punishers, but nothing like Paul's qcf+2. Another 
notable difference is his juggle game. Raven is an AWESOME juggler. He'll do 
some serious damage to you if you're not careful. 

Good news is, he's very susceptible to SS. Like I said, dance around a lot.
Obviously, he has things to deal with that, but most of them are punishable.
It's hard to give you an entire list of all of Raven's punishable moves
because he has a lot of them. A few key things to know are that damn near
every low he has is punishable. In fact, I can't think of one that isn't.
The big damage lows he has will give YOU a launcher, guaranteed.

Learn to see his qcf mix-ups. I can't help you much with predicting correctly
since it's obviously situation dependant, but you have to be able to see that
motion when Raven does it or he'll low you to death all day long. 

Raven also has somewhat of a problem with bulldogs. He has TC moves, but most
aren't really extremely fast so you can keep the pressure on. He does have
some moves that will tear you up if you don't see them coming. One is 2,4.
If this hits CH, he gets a free u/f+3 and oki. And Raven's oki game is
crucial. Also beware of d/b+4. One of his rare TC moves. If you're at medium
or close range when this hits, it'll trip you and he gets another d/b+4
guaranteed and a follow-up u/f+3 if you get out of it wrong. The only time
it doesn't is if you techroll and that's only on a rare occasion. That damn
move tech-catches and leaves him with even more juicy options. But you can
crush both of these moves with U/F+4. Just play it safe and punish, punish,
punish!




6Z. Roger Jr.:
--------------

I'm going to tell the truth, Roger is a cool and fun character all around. And
it seems that in T5 he's fairly good. He can definitely hold his own.

The main thing to watch out for is his juggles. He's got a mean techroll trap
with u/f+3+4 that guarantees another juggle if you techroll and he hits you
with it. And even if he doesn't do that, his juggles still take a healthy
chunk.

His new strings and moves are good as well and his grab game has always been
good, so watch out for that. One of Roger's main problems is that he's 
punishable. If he whiffs something you can almost guarantee yourself a
launcher and a lot of his stuff punishable on block. Very rarely is it
launcher punishable but you can punish with 2 or 4 most of the time.

One major thing to be careful about with Roger is his tricky stuff. A couple
examples: f,n,1. This move gives Roger pretty much free whatever he wants
if you block it. Thing is, it's slow and is high. It's one of his older moves
so most Tag players can see it coming but learn to see it if you can't. SS+4.
This is actually a pretty quick low that juggles. Same with d/b+3, his tail
sweep. He also has strings that end with a jump into SS+4. These are just
little things that you'll have to watch for.

Roger has some stuff to work with, but Law has the upper hand. Just play
smart and try not to get hit by the techroll catches. 




6AI. Steve Fox:
---------------

Arguably the best character in the game, right in front of Nina, Steve is a 
beast.

His game is really simple to break down, however. He's good for a couple of
reasons. The first is his juggle game. He can dish out damage much like Law
and you add a wall to the mix and... goodnight. He definitely does more
damage in the wall then Law and has crazy good mix-ups afterwards.

The second reason he's so good is his poke game. His jabs are incredibly fast
and seem to have a lot of priority over other moves. Not too mention, a lot
of his already good pokes are unparryable. Every single move he has out of 
his flicker stance is unparryable. His d/f+1 is unparryable. He also has 
quick lows.

Another reason is his frame advantages. He has very few unsafe moves and
those that are unsafe aren't going to yield you much more than jabs. This
coupled with the fact that he actually has quite a few moves that GIVE hime
advantage and you're in for a fight.

Never fear, though, he does have weaknesses. The first has to deal with his
poke game. This is a double-edged sword. He DOES have a couple hard hitting
lows, but they also happen to be WS+2 punishable. The good news is that the
lows he has that aren't extremely punishable don't do much damage. More bad
news, however, is that since Steve is all punches if you parry a low chances
are you're going to get only a hopkick and not flipkicks.

His second weakness is that he has a LOT of highs. Be modest with the d+2s
and d+1s. They are your friends.

I won't explain how to get around every move, but I will give a hint to new
players out there. Steve has a low sweeping punch (d/b+2) that does good 
damage and leads to even better mix-ups. He can also do the sweep from his
cyclone spin and a few strings. I see a LOT of new players eat this move all 
the time and it's not all that hard to get around. (That's not to say that 
you won't eat it every once in a while, but still...) Remember that it's slow
and WS+2 punishable. Just practice against it for a while and learn to see
it on reaction. This is INCREDIBLY important when Steve does the cyclone spin.
There is simply NO mix-up from that. Yes, he has a mid and a low but the mid
is MUCH faster than the sweep. Block high and watch for the low. Don't try
to guess it otherwise you'll be hurting in the morning.

Remember that he also has a punch parry himself so don't use jabs the entire
match. This WILL be an uphill battle so be patient and watch for your
openings. Good luck.



6BI. Wang Jinrei:
-----------------

There's only a couple of things to know about Wang. First is that he's a 
heavy hitter. His juggles do mad damage and he has a lot of solo hard-hitters.
The second is that he has tools to stop people from pitbulling him too much.
This isn't to say that you can't but if he catches you you're going to hurt.

How do you get around this? Well, Wang happens to be one of the unfortunate
souls who cannot launch Law after he does d+2,3. I've said earlier that you
really shouldn't use this move much, if at all. This is a match-up that it's
somewhat useful for. He CAN punish it but not being able to launch Law puts
this match-up in Law's favor dramatically. That main reason is that d+2,3 is
a high-crush. I've said it before and this is another instance that that
particular property will save you. Most of Wang's fast, pitbull-stopping moves
are high, and those that aren't are slow. This means that you can have a field
day with d+2,3. One of Wang's most abused moves is 1,1,1. Luckily for Law, 
d+2,3 east 1,1,1 for breakfast.

As long as you dance around him, keep a reasonable distance, poke with lots
of lows (including slide mix-up) and use a healthy amount of d+2,3s, you
should be okay for this match-up. Oh, and punch parry ain't such a bad idea
either. Wang has a lot of them.



6CI. Yoshimitsu:
----------------

Yoshi is an odd character, simple as that. He's not top-tier or anything like
that, but in the right hands he can be deadly.

The reason he's so odd is, well, for one he has a weapon. He definitely has
the most unblockables in the game. One of the main reasons a lot of players
get beat down by Yoshis is the simple fact that they don't know anything 
about him. I don't really blame those players a whole lot, he's not a 
commonly used character and very few people play him as their main character.

That being said, Law does have the advantage in this match-up, but there's a
few things I advise. One, if you don't know anything about Yoshi, at least
start out by going through his movelist. They have added and changed a lot so
he's not going to be the old Yoshi you remember. It doesn't anger anyone more
when they get hit by something they've never seen. Two, ramble around with 
him a little. Take that extra step and after you've learned his movelist just
mess with him for a couple of hours or so and get the feel for him. This will
greatly help you maneuver around him.

Now for the real strats. A few things to look out for. d/f+2 is a damn good
move. It seems a lot faster than it is and still launches just the same. 
Yoshi has some good juggles as well as wall stuff and he can get you there, 
no problem. Also watch for u+3+4. This is an old Kunimitsu move from Tekken
Tag Tournament. This gives him advantage, so your best bet is to just back
off. Nothing can beat out d/f+2 after you block u+3+4, so there's no sense
in trying to guess him. Main weakness of u+3+4 is that it's range is really
bad. If it whiffs, make sure you punish it. If you're quick you can get a
launcher.

Yoshi's crouch mix-ups are pretty good as well. He's got a ton of ways to get
into crouch. He can either do his sweep (FC,d/f+3), his sword sweep (FC,D/F+1)
or he can grab/launch you. He'll launch you with u/f+3 which is a really quick
jumping knee. He can do this knee from standing as well, so make sure you
watch for it. Punish it if you block it. It all depends on you, but I would
advise parrying low if you think he's going to do a low option. The sweep you
can block just fine and then punish with WS+2 or flipkick but the sword sweep
is unblockable. So if he's in range the only way to avoid it is to either 
jump it (manually or with a move that jumps) or parry it. You can also jump
the other low, too. Use caution, however, because if the jumping knee catchs
you while you're jumping he can still juggle off of it. Like I said, it's all
up to you. Go about it however you wish.

Yoshi's stances are good but only if your opponent really knows how to use
them. You get a free juggle by simply jabbing once if Yoshi goes into flea
or the new helicopter. His BT meditation stance is risky since you have the
opportunity to hit him BT for mass damage. His indian sit can also be
punished with b+2,3,4 or any string that starts with a low. If you happen to
be in the perfect position, you can also do iWS+4~DSS 2 for a big juggle.
Like I said, though, this all depends on how good your opponent is. In each
of his stances he has ways to evade different things but if you're quick and
on your toes, this shouldn't be a problem. The main thing to watch out for is
stance-switching. Good Yoshi players will go into stances from other moves
and switch from stance-to-stance on the fly.

Law has the edge in speed, juggles, wall game and grabs so the fight is on
his side. The last thing I'll warn you off is 1+4. This is called "flash."
This move is extremely fast (it comes out in only a few frames) and it's
meant to stop bulldog tactics. There are a LOT of set-ups for this move so
beware. Luckily they've continued to change it from it's highest form (which
was in Tekken Tag) and now it gives all the good stuff on hit but it's no
longer unblockable.

If nothing else, it's fun to play and watch a good Yoshi at work.





III. Juggles
_____________________________________________________________________________

**IMPORTANT NOTE** Thanks to a lot of players input and help we've compiled a
HUGE juggle list that also includes various wall strings. This can be found
at the following:

(Though it's on two seperate lines, make sure that you enter into the address
bar of your browser as only one line.) This section in this FAQ will just 
serve as a basis for any of those who don't feel like going to the above 
page. Updating it would take entirely too long and there's enough here to
satisfy your most basic juggle needs.

Make sure you read the notes at the bottom of this section, especially if 
you're having trouble getting juggles to work, a helpful hint may be in the
notes. Also, it will be fairly obvious, but I precede juggles starters with 
the "*" symbol.

Notes
******

1)If there is more than one juggle starter listed for any one particular
juggle, the damage listed is for the juggle only. It does NOT include the
damage for the JS. In other words, it's just the base damage for the juggle
itself.

2)If a juggle is listed with an optional [f+], the juggle damage will increase
by 1 for every [f+] listed if you opt to perform the [f+](s). 

3)If any other optional [] commands are listed, there will also be an extra
damage value listed under the "Damage" column within a pair of []. That
damage value is based on if you perform the optional hit.

4)Usually, the higher damage or "flashier" the juggle, the harder the
difficulty.

5)Spaces denote slight pauses between strings. They're there mostly to
make it easier to read.

6)For some juggles, using the optional [f+] version of a particular moves
will not work because the move is too slow. For example, f+4,(3),4~DSS 2 will
not always work depending on the launcher because f+4 is a littler slower
than just regular 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Juggles notes - Help with hitting juggles and which one you should use
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, if there is a dash listed in the juggle, more often than not, it's
required. But there are some cases where dashes are not needed but simply
make the juggle easier to hit. Also, I don't specify how far the dash is
suppose to take you, so mess with it. If a short dash works for you, go for
it.

If you're having trouble doing a ~DSS transition fast enough, hit up the
tekkenzaibatsu.com forums and ask people for help. We've had numerous people
ask about ~DSS juggles, so chances are you won't even have to ask, just look
around and read all the advice we've given to people in the past. The same
goes for f,f+2,1,3 juggles.

The juggles that you use when you actually play a real match are called
"staple" juggles. Eventually, most juggles will fade away into a "flashy" or
"not as useful" category and a couple of juggles will be left standing that
you should use in real matches. When you first start off, chances are you're
going to use something easy until you can hit the higher damage, more useful
juggles consistently.

Right now, the top three staple juggles for standard juggle launchers are:
4,u+3, [dash, (1_2)], f,f+2,1,3
dash, 2, dash, 4,3,4~DSS 3+4
[f+]4, junkyard~DSS 3

That may change in the future if more powerful/useful juggles come to light,
but it looks like it's going to stay that way for a while. The first two are
because they're the most damaging and are incredibly useful in wall stages
(explained in the next section). The third one is still alive only because
the chances of missing it are almost nil if you've used it enough so you'll
see it when a player doesn't want to chance anything and just wants to end a
round. Plus, it's what everyone was using when T5 first came out.




IV. Walls
_____________________________________________________________________________

There are two types of wall splats: High and low. Both can be to different
extents in that sometimes a low wall splat will be so low that nothing is
guaranteed off of it. I'm not going to list everything you can do but just
the most damaging or common things you'll see.

For high wall splat:
     f+4, 4,3,4 - 45 damage
     f+4, f+1,2,f+2,1+2 - 46 damage

Low wall splat:
     f+4,3,4 - 31 damage 
     f+1,2,f+2,1+2 - 32 damage

There are a few strategies to incorporate when you're in a wall stage. One,
learn to use moves such as 1,1,1,1,2,3 and b+3 to push your opponent to the
wall. It's not necessary to hit them with it since they travel just as far if
your opponent blocks them. Also keep in mind that you can use the same moves
to get yourself out of a corner.

Guiding your opponent into the wall with juggles is also key. Of the two main
staple juggles, 2, 4,3,4~DSS 3+4 can be stopped at any point and result in a
wall splat, with the exception of the last hit which you may be too close to
get anything off of. 

The other, 4,u+3, f,f+2,1,3 you must alter a little. Both 4 and u+3 will
result in good wall splats, but f,f+2,1,3 will result in bad wall splats in
that nothing is guaranteed if they hit the wall. To rectify this, replace
f,f+2,1,3 with dash, 1,2,f+2,2. If you stop at any of those hits, they will
give good wall splats.

A simpler approach that some people use if they're somewhat close to the wall
is simply use jab fillers. These can be used after any JS and work very well.
An example of a jab filler would be 1,2,3. Their sole purpose is to travel as
far as possible and get the opponent to hit the wall for more damage. Jab
fillers will not yield as much damage as the staple juggles, but they get the
job done.

There are also side wall splats that are explained in the basics FAQ. Most of
the time, doing one jab and then finishing with something like f,f+2,1,3 will
give you the easist juggle with good damage. There are numerous follow-ups
depending on the situation, but it's better to get what you know you can than
try something that may not hit. Sometimes they may hit at an angle where you
won't be able to get anything or very little like a jab or 4.

A special note for b+3. If you hit someone with b+3 (and go into BT) into a
wall, the best option is BT 2,2.

Just a final note, if anyone says that walls are dumb, ignore it. It's part of
the game and sometimes it'll screw you, but learn to deal with it.
     



V. Conclusion
_____________________________________________________________________________

Just like with every other character, you have to have a feel with Law to
make him work for you. It just takes practice. I've given you all the good
things I know, so do with it what you will. The whole point of this FAQ is to
give you the tools you need to mold your own style of play. I don't try to
dictate what you can and can't do, but I do give advice. You can either
accept it or ignore it. I will say this, though: If I say that something
isn't good, it's for a good reason. I'm not saying so simply because I don't
like the move, set-up, whatever. I have reasons behind everything. If there's
no difference between two things and they yield they same result, I will say
so and tell you it's guided by preference. Plus, this guide was partially
created from other people giving ME advice and telling ME what's good and
what isn't. My only hope is that this FAQ was useful to someone.




VI. Customizations, Arcade Mode and Other Useless Junk
_____________________________________________________________________________

This FAQ is designed to help you get better at the game, not get all the
customized items for Law or get Tekken Lord ranking. I don't even care if you
can't beat the computer. If you can't beat another person, then I'm all ears.
If you want to know how to do all the superfluous stuff, hit up the site I've
referenced a buttload of times already: www.tekkenzaibatsu.com. If you can't
find it there, I don't know it and have no clue where you could possibly
find it.




VII.  A Final Thank You, Credits/Links and Contact Info
_____________________________________________________________________________

I'd like to thank every single person who has contributed anything in the Law
forums that has creeped its way into this FAQ. I can't name names because it
would be impossible to look up every single thing everyone has said and
reference it, but you guys know who you are. 99% of any info I didn't come
up with came from those forums. I'd also like to thank that other 1% who
I've talked to in-person and have given me helpful tips and new information.

Lastly, I'd like to thank www.tekkenzaibatsu.com for being up and making the
Tekken scene what it is. The information there is priceless and is by far the
best site that has anything to do with Tekken on the web. All of the basics
that you should know and I've referenced in this FAQ you can find there. Big
props to Castel, the man running the show. Those combo vids gave me a head
start on making the juggle list.
