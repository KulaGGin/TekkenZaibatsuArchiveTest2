You may download and print this FAQ, but under no circumstances can you

IT IN ANY WAY or claim it as your own.

From this point on, I will only be sending FAQ updates to GameFAQs, IGN,

the Tekkenomics FAQs also has permission to host any of our future
text-based FAQs (unless specified), and can obtain updates from any of

==========================================================================
                          INTRODUCTION
==========================================================================

Welcome to my first ever FAQ on Craig Marduk.
I've made an attempt to show the people out there *some* of Marduk's
capabilities. While most of the guys would agree Marduk has the ability
to beat the crap out of others, there are still some people who think he
is a linear character to start with.

Some people might wonder why a FAQ on him, now? Well, I can give you
some reasons:

* There are no other FAQs on Tekken 5 Marduk.
* Some people may like to know how good or bad Marduk is compared to
  other characters.
* Some people seriously want to learn him.
* I never got to play DR or 6. I'm still playing this game, that's why.
* etc.

Moreover, Marduk is a very much balanced character to start with.
He is one of the most powerful characters in the game, if not THE most.
He can be very tough against most of the tekken cast. He has got some very 
unique moves which do bother others. You will come to know why am I saying
so, if you just keep reading. :)


My experience with Marduk is casual as this FAQ & the strategies will
reflect, but most of the shitt I've come upon with came from over 4 years
of my experience with him. I sincerely hope you'll find some *useful* 
info for Marduk which you could learn or incorporate in your matches
too. I'll try to be as practical with it as I can .

Also some veteran Tekken players are behind this who encouraged me to
write this FAQ.

==========================================================================
                    STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES
==========================================================================

Whenever we choose Marduk as a player, a picture that comes to mind is
an ugly looking, tall & dull guy which is slow & hardly a threat to 
anybody. But, if you play him seriously, I think you'll certainly gain
a little awareness of him regarding his style, move properties, etc. I
think he has some good speed and power to kill even the top tiers if he
is played correctly. That's why this section is dedicated to his ins &
outs.



==========================================================================
                            STRENGTHS :)
==========================================================================

1. Tackle: #1 reason to fear Marduk. Can't be reversed, only escaped.^_^

2. He doesn't have a snakedash, crouchdash, etc. BUT, he has:
   d/b+3+4 (VTS backdash), SS+3+4~3+4~3+4 (sidestep VTS cancel) which is
   extremely useful.

3. Unchickenable b+1+2 & b+3+4 reversals.

4. Okizeme, not crucial but still above many characters in the game.
   e.g.tackle

5. Inescapable air throws

6. Wonderful SS game.

7. Good bunch of unreversible moves & they also form a major part of
   his attacks.



==========================================================================
                            WEAKNESSES :(
==========================================================================

1. Him being so big makes him a soft target. That means he is easier to
   juggle than any character in the game. What else could be said that
   every character in the game has a special combo for him. DAMN!!!

2. Not special WS moves, atleast I think so. He should have been
   given a WS launcher either equal or less than 15 frames.

3. Lack of good damaging mid range whiff punishers.

4. His tracking ability isn't up to mark. He still has difficulty
   in tracking to his left.



==========================================================================
                           SPECIAL ARTS :
==========================================================================

This move analysis section is just a revised version of my old work on the
TZ forums. Some move properties rechecked, some new strategies added, more
detailed throw description now, WS moves grouped in the VTS moves section,
etc.


Before we start, i'd like you to tell you something. The legend above will
certainly help you in understanding the various moves & conventions but at
some points you'll come across some terms like okizeme, techroll etc which
might not be here so i'd like you to familiarize yourself with those terms.
I'm not going to mention them here. There are many well written faqs for
that. WildManX's Combo faq is one of them so if you want to aquaint 
yourself well i'd recommend you to check his faq for that. It's nicely
written & covers every Tekken terminology you're going to find here. So
please check it in case you feel like needing it :)

I've listed the moves description like this:
Move
Name 
Hit range
No damages mentioned, check his movelist for that. 

Let's start it now.

 

1
h
The basic 10 frame jab. It alone cannot do much. since it is 10 frames it
can be beaten by nearly all 8 framers such as Steve, Feng, Paul, Bryan,
Kazuya, etc. It is a good setup for jackhammer though. Don't stop here with
this move alone rather go for the strings that start with it.



1,2
One Two punch
hh
Basic one two punches. Good for countering in some cases. Can be a good
setup for JH ( from now onwards jack hammer will referred as JH ). The
basic 1,2 is uninterruptible. It can replace 2,1 in few cases only such
as countering Law's f+1+2, Bryan's b+1 because the basic 1 or 2 come out
equally fast but the 2,1 doesn't end that fast. That's why 1,2 is 
emphasized. Why take chances.
Also it tracks fairly well to both sides.



1,2,f+1
Elbow Sting
hhh
Ok This option after 1,2 is little slow. BUT, it has frame advantage even
on block!. It's not guaranteed after a CH 1,2. Use it for presurring 
sometimes, when they are used to 1,2 & try to attack. On hit this move 
causes a short stun. On CH ( CH here means after whiffed or blocked 1,2,
then CH f+1 )causes FCD. A d/b+4, u/f+3+4 or a FC,d/f+4 is guaranteed after
wards. Use it often, if u become predictable, they will start ducking it.



1,d+2
Straight Gut punch
h,m
A high mid string.A solid poke. Safe on block. Use it to pull Marduk out 
of tough situations. 1,d+2 can be used in cases where you think they are
gonna duck the 1. Also 1,d+2 on block has more frame disadvantage than 
1,2. So try your best to go on with 1,2. But still a safe strategy .



1,2,3
Stomach Kick
h,h,m
A hhm string. Am not sure wether it hits hits on counter. It is unsafe on
block, you will eat jabs. Another bad thing I've noticed that when u throw
that 1,2 & they guessed & duck & even if you know they're gonna do it & 
you tap 3 afterwards, their WS moves hit nearly all the times. Only use 
i've seen is it can be used after a wall splat.



1,2,3,1+2
TudoNoogie
hhmh
Another bad move which has'nt got any use either,IMO. The last head butt
is unsafe on block & it's a high too. Only use i've seen is after f,f+1(W!)
this whole string hits. Otherwise don't use it even if sparingly atleast.


1,2,3+4~3+4
VTS crouch cancel
h,h
All things same as 1,2 except it has 3+4~3+4 (VTS cancel) extension which
is the mainstay of Marduk's enormous juggles. Earlier I thought it to be a
showoff but now I have realized this thing has got its places. The cancel
itself is safe, no move can touch u. It is a good bait for reversals or
inviting them to commit some mistakes. You'll know how, keep reading.



d+1
Tank Elbow
m
A short ranged unreversible & safe mid which puts opponent in FC in all
situations be it :
A Block - a d/b+2 is uninterruptible afterwards but i'm not sure wether
          they can SS it or not. 1+2 is totally UNINTERRUPTIBLE followup.
On Hit  - a d/b+1 is guaranteed afterwards.
On CH.
It's +6 on block! but heavily punishable if whiffed. Also very  good for 
wakeup games. Plus this move leads to mixups on block, like throws, lows
etc. More in Pokes & mixups section. In 5.1 the move is +3 on block.



d/f+1
Swing upper
m
Marduk's uppercut. It comes from his left hand. It launches opponents even
if they are crouching. A guaranteed move after low parry. Can be used as 
an interrupter SOMETIMES. Tracks to Marduk's left. This move is also good 
in the sense after blocking Steve's FLK 1,1,1, 2 this move will launch him
even from the max range whereas the generic u/f+4 like King's one whiffs 
from that range. So this move has the upper edge in that respect.Though
slower only for 1frame than the latter, still holds its own. Finally, if 
you get this blocked, you'll eat jabs.



f,f+1
Blister Elbow
m 
This is Marduk's another uppercut launcher coming from his left hand. One
of Marduk's Half life enders. Tracks to Marduk's left. Safe on block but I
would say it is slow, can't be used regularly in fast games against 
8-framers. But can be used to punish them after blocking low hits that 
stagger the opponent. One more good thing about it is u can dash & delay 
the 1 & still get the move.



f,f+1,2
Blisterknuckle
mm
I myself don't use the 2 ender much but you may use it sometimes if ur 
opponent is used to f,f+1 & is coming charging, otherwise use it often.



f,f+1,2*
Delayed Blisterknuckle
mm
A uppercut combo. Hold the 2 for making the combo complete. But if the 1
is blocked, 2 can be interrupted. Not a bad move, i would say, but a bad
combo.



d/b+1
Down jab
Sm
A special mid to pull Marduk out of tough situations. A high crush & can
also be done from d/b+3+4. The fastest move you can use to counter so 
obviously it can't be underestimated.



b+1
Knuckle Dunk
M
Another mid which hits grounded opponents too. Marduk lunges back and 
throws out his left punch. On CH, some good wakeupgames. A most prominent
juggle ender. Safe on block.



1+2
Guard push
m
It has good speed. It is 13 frames & 15 on CH. So you have 3 options
afterwards
f+1+2
f,f+2
d+4
The f,f+2 does'nt connect sometimes, but you can rely on f+1+2. Use f,f+2
near a wall. Then go for the ground throw attempt, or d/f+3,1,2,3. It all 
hits. Use 1+2 for interrupting, but be sure all things can be done against
it. It can be parried, reversed etc. Full tracking. Use it wisely.



d+1+2
Shoulder impact
m
This is a move Marduk players can't live without but it's not a high crush.
It can be used to punish those whiffed jabs e.g.- Paul's 1,2 in which 1
started far off, but the 2 was to connect, there you can go for this move.
However, if paul went ahead for the 3 of his 10 strings u might eat it. So
keep it in mind. You will eat jabs if this move is blocked. 
Jin can parry it with his b+2+4.



d/f+1+2
Tudo Noogie
m
This move is a high crush. It stops all short, medium high attacks & 
creates a short stun. I've myself succeeded in interrupting the opponent
even at frame disadvantage e.g.- After blocking DJ's 1,1 & he went for it
again, this move stopped him. Leads to mixups on hit.



d/b+1+2
Sway Power Hammer
m
As the name implies, this really is a "POWER HAMMER". Has enormous damage
combos after it. This move has got a ministep to right so  doing a SSR 
manualy before throwing it out gives better results but be aware that way
chances are most of the time you'll launch them awkwardly. So be prepared
for that. Another point about it if you do a SSL instead you'll launch 
them nicely but this thing should be done rarely & only against chars. who
have weak tracking to right. The main purpose of this move is evasion so 
its a part of its turtuling strategy. Also i've seen after 2,1 strings hit
this move catches them if they try to attack.
 
Hey.., it isn't over yet, this move catches tech to right.i.e., if the 
opponent is techrolling to his left & Marduk's right. Has got nearly same 
properties of d+1+2, but is slower & more severly punshable if blocked.



u/f+1+2
Mongolian Crush
h
Ear slap that causes CFS. Fair speed, but the followups are limited. I
myself rarely use it.



f+1+2
Cyclone knuckles
h
This move has only three things good about it
1> It is guaranteed after a CH1+2
2> It is very good for punishing opponents
3> Has got a good, longer range
It is more punishable if blocked at close range, so I would say use this 
from a little far so that it just gets connected & you are only little 
unsafe. It knocks down on CH but I don't know wether a b+1 is guaranteed
after it or not. Also this move tracks very well both sides.



WS+1+2
Quick upper
m 
A fast but weak mid coming from his left hand. Short range. Its can be
a substitute to generic WS+4's which Marduk lacks for punishing the moves
that are -11 on block & put Craig in FC. It might whiff due to range
issues. Horrible.



FC+1+2:b
Craig horn - Tudo Toss
m
An easy JF. Marduk raises his head & throws opponents behind him. Looks 
like a throw. Looks like a high crush from FC, but I am not sure. You're
going to see this move many a times trying a sway hammer (d/b+1+2) &
getting this after messing up.



2,1
Kong Combo
hh
My favourite string for jab punishing cases. True combo. 2nd hit causes a
little stun. Very good setup for JH,qcb+1+2,qcf+2,etc. Marduk's 
positioning is very good after it. Has got frame advantage on block. But 
in case if it is going to be blocked you need to carefull that 1 of the 
string can be ducked. If you anticipate they're gonna do it, then do


1> 2,1,3,1 Don't move further because more bad things can be done after 
   this. Strings following it can be reversed, parried, etc & more severly
   punished on block.


2> 2,d+1+2 Can give it a try if they try to duck. I would be prefering it 
   because it has juggling chances whereas the above ones don't, even if 
   they are equally jab punishable. But I won't say completely 
   underestimate the 1> case because if they hit, opponents will stop 
   definitely in 7/10 cases (I am not a mathematician, lol) then you get a
   much better chance to land JH or qcf+2. I've seen if 2,1, qcf+2  setup
   works & you've had success with the mount, it eliminates their nearly 
   half life bar. So both cases are equally useful.

Otherwise, if they try to move after 2,1 hits & try to get cocky, kill 
them with, d/b+2, 1+2 etc.



2,d+1+2
Hook- Shoulder impact
hm
This is not a combo on normal hit neither on counter. So what is it good
for. You can use it after sidewalking them, yes, SIDEWALKING. One more use
could be if you started 2 from little far so that it whiffed, & you see 
them coming charging in, d+1+2 extension might be used. Enough about it.



f+2
= 1
= d+1
Hammer hook
hook smash
h,h
h,m
The first hit stuns on counter. It has a nice juggle afterwards. 2nd hit
stuns regardless, if the first move is blocked or whiffed. Use f+2 with
little caution because

(1) Alone f+2 is jab punishable on block if you stop there or try to delay
    the 1

(2) Even if f+2 hits as a normal hit, they can still duck, so mixup with 
    d+1. But in most cases i've seen if people know that the opponent is
    good, they don't duck it. But still be careful. Lastly f+2,1 is a 
    good juggle ender.



d/f+2
Gut Punch
m
A mid gut punch, fairly fast. Safe on block & leads to mixup on hit. Can 
be used sometimes.



d+2,4
Alligator
m,m
A combo which does nice chunk of damage. If the first hits, last hits too.
Safe on block, even if you stop there. Use it for pressuring sometimes, 
but u have a better d/b+2 which isfaster also. It's range sucks, sometimes
the 4 whiffs. But the damage it does is worth it. Also, if in rare case 
the 2 whiffed & 4 ender connected as a CH, you get a CFS. Same as a 
CH WS+4, but followups are'nt same. Follow with d/f+3,1 combos. And in 
case I haven't mentioned, its unreversible too. Good good.



d/b+2
Flash Tomahawk
m 
A fast mid which short stuns opponents. On counter, a d/b+1 is guaranteed
after it. A normal hit or block also provides good positioning. It is a
low crush from close range. It has got a little preference over d+1 also,
because its fast. A strong part of Marduk's offense BUT the worst part of
this move--> It doesn't track =(



b+2
Rolling Back Chop
m 
A mid that tracks to Marduk's left. Stuns on counter, small combos are
possible from it. A fair whiff punisher & good range. Also, good for
punishing backrollers. But, jab punishable on block.



f,f+2
Elbow Sting
h 
Its a high. It KNDs on hit & is UNREVERSIBLE. Use it more often, as it 
adds an element of speed he typically lacks. According to official sources
this move is 11 frames but it is almost impossible to bring it out so fast
This move is also guaranteed after a CH 1+2 & has got a nice property to
punish after most blocked attacks. It is guaranteed after blocking Steve's
d/f+1+2. Tracks to Marduk's right.



SS+2
Backhand Spin Knuckle
m
I would better say it a tech catcher & slight whiff punisher. Good to
punish those whiffed u/f+4s, Paul's deathfist sometimes ( Although u have
better options ). Catches backrollers. One good use i've seen , after a 
WS+4 & they try to move then SSR+2. It will hit them. Otherwise, if they
stay there, then SSR & do d/b+4. Again only for idea.



(SLD_FCD)2_d+2
Wake up hammer_ Wake up sweep
m_L
Nothing needs to be told about the FCD one I think. The SLD one has uses.
The d+2 sweeps the opponent. I don't compeletely know wether combos are
possible from it. I myself use d/f+4_u/f+3+4 after this. The simple 2 is
really a wake up hammer, looks much like the d/f+1+2 in the end. 
Be careful don't get d+2 blocked.



3
Hook kick
h
The basic high kick. Knocks them down. Unsafe on block.



d/f+3,1
m,h
For this one I won't list the names as they are many of them. 
Natural combo from mid range. Also good setup for JH(d/f+3,1). You can
replace the 2 for d+2 also. All other further strings are the same as
start with 1,2. U can go for f+1 after 2 SOMETIMES for pressuring. Also 3
after 2 is a combo after a wall splat.



d/f+3,d+1
m,m
This is Marduk's biggy. Launches on CH. The d+1 in the sting itself 
catches tech rollers & launches on normal hit, even crouchers. One
situation to show you that d+1 launches them on normal hit: Throw out a 
f,f+2 so that it hits. Now don't rush, stay there. Throw out d/f+3,d+1 
slightly delay the d+1. What do you see?
The d+1 launches them. How? Reasons might be:

 >> Either they were crouching & predicting the 1 to come out. OR

 >> They thought as if 1 was going to whiff, so they rushed in.

 
These are the reasons I feel why were they launched. However, you may come 
across many situations when you will be launching them like this. It 
proves that d+1 in the string d/f+3,d+1 launches on normal hit too. Set up
for this move with d/f+3,1. Practice & learn to note the difference 
between 1 & d+1, so that whenever you see d/f+3 as CH, you can go for d+1
instead of 1, even if you had predecided to go for 1. Learn to delay 
between d/f+3 & 1_d+1 a little bit to learn the mixups. I prefer this move
above f+3, because it is faster. Go for the 2 ender after d+1, only if you
see it blocked, because d+1 is jab punishable on block. Play with it 
smartly. 


d/f+3,d+1,2
m,m,h
Ohh.. I really don't bother about this move anymore now. Reason:
 >> The last 2 is a high. 
 >> The last 2 can be SSR
 >> The last 2 by  is prone to reversals, parries, etc.
 >> Most of the tekken cast can interrupt the last 2 with jabs after
    blocking d+1.
Do you want to know anything else?


f+3
Knee lift
m 
Marduk's another move which has got huge combos if it hits as CH. Is 
slower than d/f+3, but is safe on block. This move pushes back so far that
you are safe. Use it sometimes for creating breathing room. That far 
d/f+3,d+1 setup can work after this move is blocked.



d/f+3,1+2
Stomach kick- Tudo Noogie
mh
I don't use it as often. But has got a use though, use it against 
characters who try to parry or reverse 1 or d+1 after d/f+3. Mix it up 
with them sometimes. Whole move hits on CH. Safe on block.



d_d/b+3
Step Shin kick
l 
It's NOT short ranged. It looks so but actually isn't. Silly me for giving
wrong information. Also, it is a very important part of his wakeup games.
Doesn't hit grounded opponents. Mix it up with d+4. Since d+4 cannot be 
parried, they'll always block it and launch Marduk. Use d/b+3 because if 
they block it, Marduk eats some WS kicks but will not be launched. 
Be careful, this low can be parried.



FC+3
Low spin kick
L
The common low kick every character has except Steve. Not safe on  block,
but hits grounded opponents.



(f,f,f_WR)+3
Bicycle Kick
M
Marduk Technical Jumping move. Meaty damage.
He jumps & hits grounded opponents & crushes lows. However people  never 
use it for that purpose at least. I have not seen f,f,f, versions good use
yet. Some times, this move fails to contact also, and gets whiffed. Good 
use for pressuring sometimes. You may also be floated if your opponent 
throws jabs.



3+4 - Regular VTS stance more talks on it in VTS section.



d/b+3+4
Backdash VTS
-
Marduk's backdash. Its the best evading & spacing move in the game, 
according to me only, hehe. This is a movement which has to be used 
regulary. Though vulnerable, but still if used smartly, it can turn tides
in your favour, atleast I think so. It evades much many moves if timed
correctly. For instance Bryan's 3,3 - 3,2,1, Hwoarang's 4,4,4, strings, 
Heihachi's f,f+2. After the dash you have following options which fit as
the circumstances may be

a) The tackle
b) d/f+4
c) f+2
d) 2
e) WS+3_4

a) Should be used rarely because major players never allow Craig to mount.
   Even the spear, I've seen sometimes getting escaped.

b) d/f+4: It could be better pick compared to mount. Good use in those
   situations like  suppose you are at a slight distance against Marshall
   that his WS+2 just won't connect. If he tries WS+2 he whiffs and if he
   goes for FC,d/f,d,d/f+3 (dragonslide)it whiffs too. Punish with d/f+4
   as it fits best in this situation and opens a chance for some oki.

c) f+2 - I used it sometimes for teasing people after the backdash; they
   come charging in and eat this move. Also after grounded opponent are
   getting up and you quickly do VTS+3+4,f+2 they eat this move sometimes
   , with the fear of f+2 and 2+4 mixups. But, nevertheless, this is not
   a smart choice at all, as they can interrupt him badly. 

d) The possibility for this move has already been mentioned.


e) WS+3 is the perfect followup, though punishable on block, if you are
   able to make their attacks whiff with d/b+3+4. 

f) WS+4_1 are just for countering.   

If you are just playing defensive and trying to evade them, then do
SS+3+4~3+4~3+4 after the backdash as the movement and the stance after it
both are punishable. Also it can't be cancelled by d/f_d/b and 3+4.



f+3+4
Alligator Tackle
m
Marduks' running headbutt
Whatever you call it, can be used for pressuring. Sometimes they mistake
it for a tackle and eat it. After a successful f+3+4, a run up b+1 is 
guaranteed, even if they tech. You can also try a ground throw if they 
lie there fore more fruits. A small bad thing about it is it can be evaded
by SSing & a small good thing about it is it catches tech to Marduk's left.



(u/b-u-u/f)+3+4
Gator Stomp
M
A slow ground hitting TJ move. Looks dirty, but  Marduk's all about dirty
games afterall. On block no body is at disadvantage. If they eat hit 
crouching, you have the following followups

1)f,f+1+2
2) d/f+1 juggle
3)qcb+1+2
4)d+2,4. However, stomp must hit at maxrange for this to work.
5)f,f+2
6)d/b+2
7)d+4
It also works for tech traps in 5.0 but I haven't heard of any uses still
in 5.1. This move also works as a fake offense, baiting etc.



SS+3+4
Sidestep VTS
-
Tap either side u_d for asidestep & then 3+4 to go into VTS stance. 
Immediate followups are slow. I myself use VTS+3. I don't know why but if
you do this (SS+3+4,3) all of a sudden, they eat it. Mix it up with 2+4,
d/f+4,tackle. The tackle option is not for a front attack, but if you SSed
properly their attacks, you will be behind them. The tackle may turn into
a spear but atleast you may be sure of mount. This is a  very nice tool to
avoid opponents attacks. This movement also comes from d+3+4 which is a
little faster also. but doesn't work from u+3+4. Why? You know well. Don't
do it blindly, you may be hit during the sidestep.



SS+3+4~3+4~3+4
SS VTS cancel
-
It is the cancel for the sidestep VTS. It is the greatest part, IMO. In 
the above part Marduk was vulnerable even after the stance for some time.
But cancelling it in this way is safe. It is also good to get more fruits,
since the options are limited with the above. But with this you have more
stuff to deal your opponent with. Safety issues are same during  the ssing
as the above.
These are the following ways to perform it:-
3+4, SS+3+4~3+4~3+4
d/b+3+4, SS+3+4~3+4~3+4 
During tackle run( Before 3 steps), SS+3+4~3+4~3+4


4
Sideswipe kick
h
Marduk's magic 4. Creates minor stun on hit. Launches on CH. A f+2+4_f+1+2
is guaranteed & easy juggle aftewards. You may also try f,f,N+1,2,3+4~3+4
followps but they are hard to land. You need to react quick & anticipate a
CH, then only you can do this. Otherwise, rely on the f+2+4_f+1+2 ender.



b+4
Bazooka Heel
h
It knocks down on hit. Nothing is guaranteed afterwards. BUT this move is
no giant killer. Stick to its only usual & useful property of whiff 
punishment & don't look beyond. Also, it's very predictable so people 
usually don't block it when they know its coming.



d/b+4
Leg Scissors
l
This move looks like they have tried to give him something like king's
d/b+4. It is more unsafe on block as compared to king's one because he 
(Craig)falls KND position. On hit, both will be grounded. A wakeup 3 will
hit them afterwards but sometimes it might whiff. No problem though. You
can still block or parry anything they throw on you. 
On CH this move turns into "Leg Trip Takedown throw", opponent is in FCD
position with Marduk at their back. More usefull near walls. Good okizeme
& tackle chances are there rather in open fields. Use it from a little 
SSR. This move avoids highs at the end but smart opponents can low parry
it and launch. Also in the initial frames, if they guessed they can throw
jabs & you will be floated.



Opponent grounded d/b+4
Ground Stomp
L
Marduk's foot stomp. He performs it when the opponent is grounded. You can
try it after a successful f+3+4, if they lie there, after various throws,
mount etc. ( See okizeme section.) Also it comes out after you break a 
throw or opponents break em. But it is of no use in situations where 
throws have special break animations. Use it generally after the 1+2 break
which don't have special break animations. Use it near walls. Just for
telling its properties.



d/f+4
Side Kick
m
It is a very slow mid. I think d/f+3,1 is a better option. Also d/f+4 is 
jab punishable. But still, it has a use. People mistake it for a d/b+3 
sometimes. It works well when they are getting up from ground.



d+4
Knee Slicer
l
Marduk's best low. It ducks under high attacks & it is unparryable. Its 
fast too. 14 frames & -16 on block. Good for oki also. Tracks to Marduk's
right. BUT, just don't get it blocked.



FC,d/f_D/F+4
Gator Sweep
L
A long range low that hits grounded.In fact, it is Marduk's longest range
move. It KNDs on CH, & on regular hit, opens following options :
- WS+4 Uninterruptible.
- FC,d/f+4
- Throws
  The throws include JH, qcf+2, qcb+1+2, also. How? It is explained 
  further. Remember, these are just mixups, they are'nt guaranteed 
  followups. That means they can be blocked & escaped( for throws).
  But after a CH hit, you have: 
- FC,d/f+4
- u/f+3+4
- FC,d+3
- Crouch cancel d/b+4
This low is one of his best. Has got much long range & tracks a bit to his
right. It also useful for punishing whiffs. If you learn to use it 
properly, it can win you matches.



f+4
Wild stomp
M
A mid hits grounded opponents. It has following properties:
>> It is unsafe on block. ( You will eat a WS+4 )
>> It is slow
It has frame disadvantage on hit too, that means you can't keep the 
pressure going with it. But this move isn't meant to hit standing 
opponents. Its a part of Craig's strong oki & can be used after a 
succesful mount, various throws etc. More in oki section.



u/f+4
m
A TJ move which is used for low crush purposes. Heck.. its the only move
you can rely upon for low crush purposes. The good thing about it is:-
>> It crushes all types of lows.
>> Is SAFE on block. Pushes opponent in crouch.
>> Has a small combo too.
Earlier i thought it to be nonsense but now i've realized how important it
is. Use it whenever you feel a low is coming. Its very good against 
Steve's d+1, Bryan's d/b+3 & similar safe lows so if you haven't been 
using it just start. It has its places.



==========================================================================
                               THROWS:
==========================================================================

Marduk throw game is good if not great & he is no less than king & Nina in
this department. He has got two 2 double button breaks, UNCHICKENABLE
airthrows, 5 single breaks, 2 crouchthrows( Though not so important), & 
the groundthrows. Good thing about his throw game is you'll be needing it 
almost every now or then in your game. Most of them also provide very good
positioning. Lets see them one by one.

NOTE: Sidethrows aren't going up on the list, as I don't know anything 
special about them. Backthrows will be discussed in brief.


[F]+1+3_VTS 1+3
Rolling splash
Powerbomb with a rolling startup. Break with 1. Switches sides, wether 
they eat it or break it. I don't know wether any thing is guranteed 
afterwards or not, but you can do some mean things if they roll away.
>> Dash in, f+2+4. YES, it works.
>> 3+4, 1+2. No dash required.
Also, this throw is very good to use if they're backed towards walls. If
you landed it at this particular instant, Craig will be right behind them
close to their feet from where you can do:
>> d/b+4      : UNINTERRUPTIBLE. Can only be siderolled.
>> Groundthrow: They can't sideroll it. Either break it or throw some
   wakeup kicks but kicks are very rare.
Since this situation itself is very rare so there are very less chances 
they will avoid the guessing games. Nice, huh?


[F]+2+4
Knee crusher
Craig picks opponent up and slams his/her crotch on his knee, very dirty
hehe. Nothing guranteed afterwards. Switches sides if broken. Break with 2.
Also, it one of the most escaped throws in the game.



qcf+1
Northern lights suplex
Break with 1. 
A good throw. If you landed it, go to mount by all means. I use in case 
where I have blocked something which hasn't got any punishment or if I am
going for simple throws as such. But given a choice, I'd like to replace 
it with JH always because JH has only one chance of escaping whereas this
one has 2 breaking points.



qcf+2
Powerslam
Breakwith 2
Same properties as qcf+1, but no replacement. That means, you have to be
careful they don't break it. But I've seen it is not breaked that often as
the regular 2+4 does. This throw hasn't any replacement but it can be for
2+4 in few cases. 



f,hcf+1
Jack hammer
Break with 1
This is the one we have been talking about always. Unlike king's one it 
hasn't got range & speed, but very good damage & Craig's positioning after
this throw is also very sweet. Good oki chances afterwards & if they lie 
there even for a slightest nick of time, go for the foot stomp(d/b+4), it
hits them. This throw is bufferable a lot & can be setup as after:
2,1 
d/f+3,1
1
1,2
1,d+2( Near walls.)
SS
After a run
FC,d/f+4
A dash
regular hit f+1+2 ( should be close hit though)
WS+1
Basically any move with a forward input can buffer JH. For moves that 
don't have f input, just tap f after the animation ends & then hcf+1. For
FC,d/f+4, after the animation just hold D/F for a split second, then hcf+1
to do JH or you may tap d/f again as soon as the move hits & then hcf+1. 
Be careful, if you messed up you may come up with WS+1. Same things follow
for qcf+2 from FC also. You need to do hcf for that too.



f,f+1+2
Atomic buster
Break with 1+2
Forget about King's GS. This throw is no less than that. Everything's good
about it. It has double button escape, comes out from a f,f dash so good 
range & most importantly it JUGGLES. One of the best throws but since it 
comes out from a dash it has ultracrap escape timing.



qcb+1+2
Backfreaker
Break with 1+2
This throw doesn't require a dash so a good alternative to Atomic buster
sometimes. Good damage. Good positioning after it but anythying is 
guranteed after it or not, I am not sure. This throw is not escaped as 
much as f,f+1+2.



VTS+2+4
Body slam
Break with 2
Although this throw has a trickier execution or say it is hard to set, but
I have seen once you landed it & your opponent tries to move away from 
Craig, just dash in & tap f+2+4 for a back throw again! Huge damage. This
trick works with a few WS+3 juggles too.
WS+3, 1, d/f+3,1,2,3+4~3+4, d/b+4 being one of them.
Besides the above the opponent is prone to many good wakeup games & oki.



Airthrows
F+[1+3]
F+[2+4]
f,f+1+2

Airthrows are an important addition to Marduk's juggle game. Their strong
feature too, is being, UNCHICKENABLE. Here's a quick info about them:

>> The range of airthrows goes on like this:
   1+3_2+4 --- Same range as Jabs. Does 17 damage.
   f,f+1+2 --- Longer range than the above ones & does more damage too.(25)
               You can always replace 1+3_2+4 with this throw in any combo
               but timing also should be practiced.
 f+1+3_f+2+4-- Same thing as the first but adding a f increases range of
               the enders of which f+2+4 has got the longest range. In
               fact, f+2+4 is the longest range throw in Marduk's arsenal.
               f+1+3 can be replaced with f+2+4 but f+2+4 cannot be 
               replaced with f+1+3 in certain situtations.
               Also, if there's a wall on Craig's right side, go for f+2+4
               ender. Craig'll throw them into the walls & the damage for
               the throw becomes 25. You can go for d/b+4 stomp afterwards.
               It hits them nearly everytime.
To sum up, the range of airthrows goes on like this:
 1+3_2+4 ------ Least
 f,f+1+2 ------ Medium
 f+1+3_f+2+4--- Long

Other than this:
1+3 has got strongest wakeup games compared to others. Opponent is thrown
into FCD position from where you have many setups. See Pokes & Mixups sec.
2+4 just looks cool. The opponent is thrown far away from any guaranteed
wakeup games.
f,f+1+2 also isn't good in that department. Opponent lies in the SLD
position from where you can't expect any major strategy.



d+1+3_d+2+4
Break 1_2
They are regular crouch throws. They are  guaranteed after a low parry,if
d/f+1 does'nt reach properly. Also guaranteed after they tech to their
right after a wall splat or wall combo. Just ss along with them & throw
out anyone of your choice. These throws look cool but for the most part u
can replace them with better moves.



d/b+1+3_d/b+2+4.
Break 1_2
His ground throws have many variants. Some of them form a strong part of 
his combos. I know each one has a different name, but I don't bother 
listin them. These throws also catch siderolling opponents.

> Any ground grab from KND, SLD, PLD,or FCD, tosses them in the air. The
  throw itself is very weak & can be tech rolled. That is why Marduk 
  players juggle them for more damage . These throws are breakable too.

> Opponents position for this needs to be face down & sideways. Marduk
  kicks them & they are thrown away far.
 
> Oppoents position for this has to be face up & sideways. Marduk throws a
  punch & mounts. The chances for these 2 throws to land are very rare but
  I haven't seen any one of them getting  escaped as often .



A few words about backthrows. Whenever you get a chance to do a backthrow
go for the 2+4 (Rolling splash), even though it does less damage than 1+3
because you get some good chances for wakeup games, I myself use it & 
after a succesful 2+4 I do a d/b+4, they eat it nearly all the times. You 
can also land a d/f+3,d+1 if they getup wrong. Since backthrows aren't a 
thing that will happen every now & then, you can give it a try for d/b+4,
less chances are they will block it.



Marduk's reversals 

b+1+2- reverses all high attacks
b+3+4- reverses all mid attacks
These doesn't work on head butts,knees, elbows, shoulder push etc. These
work only on punches & kicks. Greatest thing about them is they're 
UNCHICKENABLE. Go for the Marduk's reversals only on the following 
conditions :

> See what you are trying to reverse, can be reversed. It's dead obvious,
  but sometimes people don't understand.


> See that the move you are trying to reverse is punishable on block or 
  can be avoided by SSing or making it whiff or not. If you can punish a
  move after blocking or anything more badly, then don't go for the 
  reversal.e.g._ Laws 4,u/f+3, this move is safe on block  but can be SSR.
  So reversing here won't be worth the effort.


> See that your attempt to do a reversal is successful, or it doesn't 
  whiffs. Be sure about it e.g; Marshall's f+1+2, Bryan's b+1 etc are 
  reversible but if you messed up, they will give you what you deserve.
 

> Here's a situation: Your tackle is escaped by DevilJin, he throws out
  WS+1,2 (I don't know its name). Do not try to reverse the 2nd hit. I
  don't why but i've never been able to do it. Don't try to do this on 
  similar strings.e.g., Kaz- WS+1,2, Julia's 1,1,1 & moves like that. 
  However, this is not a problem with other chars. like king, Paul, 
  Nina etc.


> Another situation: You're playing against Law. He throws Junkyard combo
  (b+2,3,4) for which you weren't ready & you blocked the 3: DO NOT try to
  reverse the 4 ender. You'll be launched again. Same applies to Lei's
  4~4,3,3 & similar stuff. It's not impossible BUT hard.


Here's a list of some reversal baits:-
Assume they are blocking each move unless i mention.

d/b+2--> It pushes back & forces crouch on block. So most of the time
you'll see them throwing a WS+4 or any such move. Dash in & reverse it.

SS+3+4~3+4~3+4--> Assume they break the tackle. You did a d/b+3+4, 1+2.
They see this & rush to you but you immediately did SS+3+4~3+4~3+4. If 
they throw any move you, you can reverse it generally.

u/f+3+4--> It gives 0 frames on block. So you can try.

f,f+2--> Only -1 on block.
Anything else that puts Marduk on even or close to even is preferably is
used for baiting but whatever that works for you is good. So, moral of the
discussion is if you see someone annoying you with some unusual moves, 
don't let it unpunished, wether by blocking them, by making them whiffed 
or by reversing. Choose the option which does maximum damage according to
the situation.



Marduk's tenstrings 
They are two of them, pretty bad, not much utility, they can be easily
reversed, parried etc. in between. Only good thing about them the kick 
ender juggles till the 3rd last move. Also I think the 2nd tenhit is combo
from behind but I'm not sure...I leave it to readers to find it themselves.
The starting jabs af the strings themselves are good to stop there as they
can be used for jab punishment or countering SOMETIMES. Otherwise use them
very rarely.



==========================================================================
                    VALE TUDO STYLE: STANCE & MOVES
==========================================================================

The stance itself is a ducking animation & goes under highs. Craig is
vulnerable in the initial frames of the stance, but after going into it
you can remain there for indefinite period if you don't do anything.
Since there are certain moves which cannot be done from a d/b+3+4, hence
they are mentioned with a *. It means you cannot do this move from a
d/b+3+4.
You can go to the VTS stance in the following ways:
  3+4
  d/b+3+4_SS either side
  SS+3+4 either side
  During the tackle SS either side before 3 steps.

From a VTS stance you can do:
 

3+4*
VTS cancel
-
It is the cancel for the above stance.Should be done immidiately after 3+4
(3+4~3+4). During the initial frames of getting into stance, Marduk 
remains vulnerable for any attacks but if you cancel it in this way you 
are totally safe. Its more a bait for reversals & turtule block-punishing. 


1+2
Tackle
Break with 1+2
The "DREADED" tackle. This is the move Marduk's known for. If there is any
reason Craig could be cheap for, this is it. This is a move that's abused
every now & then in Craig's game. If the opponent is turtuling throw it 
out & see them paying for it dearly, however, the sense to be applied 
behind it is not to throw it out whenever you feel but when the 
opportunity says it. This move is good for the following reasons:

>> Can only be escaped, can't reversed. :)
>> Guaranteed mount from back.
>> Full tracking upclose.
>> Also works as a okizeme tool.
>> You can also ss either side before 3 steps by tapping u_d to get
   back to VTS stance or SS+3+4~3+4~+3+4 to get back to normal position
   safely.
If tackle is done from a distance it turns into spear where Marduk pounces
over the opponent without that " Grab & Slam " animation. If tackle is
successful, you get to the mount positon from where you can do:
 1, 1+3, 2~1  -----  Break with 2
 2, 2+4, 1~2  -----  Break with 1
 1+2_3+4      -----  Press nothing or anything except 1 or 2.

You may come to hear about people who are good at escaping mount. The 
reason this happens, they are good at reading Craig's shoulders. The 
defense against them is to mix the pro mount followups with 1~2_2~1. Yes,
they may be good breaking those left & right combinations but this fake
one works well at high levels. Mixing these two with the other options 
makes the opponent sweat with the subsequent no. of mounts.
Remember, however good they may be, if you mixup all the options well you 
yourself increase the chances you will have success with the mount. Saying
it all on paper is easy, but implenting it in the games is the real thing.
Keep practicing it, you yourself will understand the timing for it.


WS_VTS+1
Health Tap
m
A mid which comes out reasonable fast. Marduk throws out his left hand 
which is fast but not strong. Tracks to Marduk's left & is a good setup 
for JH. This move looks to have limited uses but really isn't that bad. It
stops any rushing game in its tracks, mostly after evading an attack with 
d/b+3+4. Plus it can be a safe bait for reversals on hit & block. Its a 
move for the people who want to play Craig extra safe. Tracks to Marduk's 
left.


WS_VTS+2
Tornado Chop
h
Its high & a litle slow. Tracks both sides. A b+1 is guaranteed after it
hits.Its best to use after evading any attack with SS+3+4. More 
possibilities to use it are after a d/b+3+4 (Backdash) when you see 
Bryan's 3,2,1 or Devil Jin's b,f+2,1,2 of which the 1st hit whiffed or 
anything like that. Just to give an idea.


VTS,f+2
Power Straight
m
A moderate fast mid from VTS. It KNDs on hit. I give it a little 
preference over VTS+3_4 because

1> VTS+3 is unsafe on block, it is not.

2> VTS,f+2 has a better range than VTS+4 . 
   But the bad news--> It is slower than both the above.


WS_VTS+3
Raid Kick
m
Say it Marduk's launcher from WS as nearly every character has. It 
launches awkwardly & has crappy combos afterwards. Good in the sense it 
has got nearly as much range as Jin's WS+2 & is much used after evading an
attack with d/b+3+4 or SS+3+4 too. Bad thing it is too slow (18 frames) so 
you won't be able to launch with it after blocking a low or ducking throws
every time & it isn't guaranteed even after Law's d/b+4, Nina's WTF, 
Roger's SS+4 etc. They have to be dealt the hard way.i.e, f,f+1 or u/f,N+4
This move has limited uses as a WS launcher & more for baiting purposes. 
Also note if you landed it on a BT opponent, you can follow with d/f+1 
combos.


WS_VTS+4
Kong Knee
m
The data for this move says it is 13 frames, so it is a OK fast. But 
compared to other characters, it is a bit slower e.g. King's one is 11 
only. It KNDs on hit( with no strong followps) & stuns on CH which give u 
three options afterwards:
> f+4
> A groundthrow ( Breakable)
> d/b+4
It is short ranged mid so be carefull, don't get this whiffed. Also, it 
has no tracking ability.


u_d
Sidestep
The same thing as you do SS+3+4.


d/f+4
Its FC,d,d/f+4 starting from VTS stance also.


d/b+1
Down jab
Sm
The fastest thing from 3+4 & d/b+3+4. The best choice if you feel u didn't
time the d/b+3+4 right. Stops anything & not much of a worry even if it
whiffs. Just be careful about hopkicks.


d+4
The generic high crush low kick everyone has, not safe.


d+1+3_d+2+4
The regular crouch throws.


d+3
May be used after evading moves with d/b+3+4, when Craig's back is near 
walls, sounds stupid but can be handy sometimes. I am not kidding! 
Can say it a whiff punishment, lol.


u/f_u_u/b+3+4
From the stance, this move works more as a fake offense & invites 
opponents to commit some mistakes. Other wise properties are the same as 
the regular ones.


d/b+1+3_d/b+2+4
It can also can be done from a VTS. I've seen when they break the mount &
I do the tackle & then SS while they stay there on the ground, i landed 
this ground grab on them. It worked for me sometimes BUT only sometimes.


VTS d/f(low parry)* Although the above one works sometimes inspite of the
fact they can kick Marduk & get away from the situation. For that, u need
to condition them with a VTS d/f low parry & again with some fake offense.
This low parry works as the regular low parry.


d/f_d/b* 
Stance cancel.
The VTS stance can be cancelled in this way & is faster than 3+4~3+4 too.
Don't believe me. Just try & see it yourselves. More on it in the 
Strategies section.


That's all I know about Marduk's moves. If you know something other than
this, please drop me a mail. It will be put here. 



==========================================================================
                      THE ESSENCE OF MARDUK:
==========================================================================

This is a quick reminder of Marduk's moves as when to use to get best 
results:

Poking moves( Better use when turtuling ):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1,d+2: Best to use, stops any high mid guessing game. Also avoids lows
       sometimes.
d/b+1: High crush, short range.       
d+4  : Although punishable, best low since it avoids highs, fast & 
       unparryable.     
f,f+2: Fast & irreversible. Slice of speed in Marduk's game. 
1+2  : Frames on normal hit & followups on CH. Easy to use.  
d/b+2: Force crouch on hit & block.                          
d+2,4: Irreversible & safe. Medium speed.


Spacing or Evading moves:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

d/b+3+4: Best spacing tool in the game. Highly abusable
d/b+1+2: Better to use after ssing to weaker sides of opponents.
SS+3+4 : Best time to use VTS moves if its done well.
SS+3+4~3+4~3+4
       : Craig's best sidestepping move. Safe too.


CH catchers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1+2      : Fast & safe on block.
4        : Magic 4. 40+ on CH. Safe.
d/b+2    : Got extra tick damage on CH. Better to use mixups after it.
f+2      : Medium speed but combos breakable on CH.
d/f+3,d+1: Massive damage on CH, but jab punishable.
(d+2),4  : Safe & irreversible. Nice combos.
d,d/f+4  : Good damage for a low, highly risky.
f+3      : Safe but slow.
CH(1,2),f+1
         : Mostly a pressuring tool, least used for CH hunting.


High crush:
~~~~~~~~~~~

d+4      
d/b+1    
FC+1+2   
d,d/f+4

3+4~4  : Close range, after ducking jabs & throws.
3+4~3  : Mid range, better after ssing.

f,f+1  : Mostly after backdashing their wakeup kicks.
d/f+1  : Close range.
Tackle itself.


Tracking moves:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is said that Craig going to have tough time tracking his opponents. Its
true but he still has a good list of moves that lock the target & they are
pretty useful.
This is a small list of moves that track. Not all, some important ones, for
the people who have troubles against swaying & dancing opponents. 
If i say Left assume that the move tracks to Craig's left.

==========================================================================
                     STRATEGIES: WHAT IS MARDUK'S STYLE? 
==========================================================================

This is the most difficult part to describe. Marduk's game is very 
versatile. It is mostly centered around turtuling, spacing & baiting. When
you play him, most of the time your opponent starts attacking, forcing you
to go into the shell, and it is here that you have to show some skills & 
get some respect for Craig.
Before starting it can I expect that:
>> You know your combos well, do not try what you can't land consistently.
   Use only those with which you are comfortable.
>> Learn to punish your opponent's move as badly as you can. Seriously,
   it can be key to victory sometimes. 
>> We know Craig is going to have tough time against most of the tekken
   cast, but you should also not make any stupid mistakes yourselves.
If the above things are fine with you, this section can help you better,
although its just for the start. I know that there's always a possibility
of better things to do but I also hold my own.

Let's start this topic with the move that has made Craig so famous in the 
game.

                          TACKLE:
                         =========
              3+4, 1+2_SS+3+4, 1+2_d/b+3+4, 1+2
Assume for a while they don't know how to break it, they're just eating it
whenever it connects. We'll discuss all the possibilities one by one.


Round starts, you throw the tackle. What happened? They ate it. Fine. Next 
time you tried again but they launched you. Why? It's difficult to say
exactly why but what i've understood is if your opponent is close & 
Craig's just started for running for tackle, before 3 steps, your opponent 
throws out any launcher( Mostly less than or equal to 15 frames ), Craig 
gets launched. Bad, isn't it?
The defense against it is, as i've understood till now:-
>> To use tackle after some movements like - d/b+3+4, SS+3+4 etc.
>> To use tackle after some frame adv.( Frame advantage here means to 
   throw tackle after moves that hit opponent & he usually does not move
   .e.g., CH d/b+2, (f+2), d+1, d+1 etc.
>> As okizeme.


Let's start with movement tricks first:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>> First of all, i want to repeat something.
   3+4 & SS+3+4 are vulnerable in the intial frames whereas d/b+3+4 is for
   the whole animation. Doing a 3+4~3+4 or 3+4~3+4~3+4 ends up the VTS 
   stance safely( 3+4~3+4 is only for the basic 3+4 stance. For all the 
   rest you have to do 3+4~3+4~3+4. )

>> During the tackle, craig gets launched if he's started to run or before
   3 steps. If the tackle is about to end or is going to become a spear,
   Craig's floated, not launched.

   Here are 2 situations:-
1) If the opponent is attacking & Craig's turtuling:-


>> Do not do 3+4 directly or you may be launched. Your foe will hunt for 
   things that lead to tackle & similar stuff. If he sees stance or tackle
   , he'll straightaway rush to you & hit you as both the stance & tackle 
   are vulnerable in their initial animations.

>> Use d/b+3+4 & d/b+3+4, SS VTSc( From now onwards SS+3+4~3+4~3+4 will be
   referred as SS VTSc) more often. It fits better in this situation as it
   is made for making things whiff and evading them. Best in the open 
   areas. If you did d/b+3+4 without any plans & they rush, do SS VTsc. 
   It'll save Marduk's BIG ass.

>> Don't use SS+3+4 from close range or you'll end up with the same result
   as said with 3+4, 1+2. Do SS+3+4, 1+2 only if you really ssed them, 
   otherwise SS VTSc will end things safely.

>> Use d/b+3+4, 1+2 only in cases where you've evaded the moves that have
   got slow whiff recovery. If you evade jabs, * magic* 4s & similar quick
   stuff & throw it out, chances are you may not be launched but still be
   stopped with quick d+2 & similar pokes. You don't want that to happen,
   do you? So, just SS VTSc again & giveup the idea for a while. Wait for
   your chance to come.


2) If Craig's attacking & the opponent is turtuling:-

>> It is said that turtules are going to have rough time against Craig but
   it is not true in all cases. A good turtule knows a Craig player can't
   live without tackle so he'll sit back & wait for it to come out.
   So what's the strategy here?

   Again do not do 3+4, 1+2 from close. Do it from a distance so that it 
   looks like it'll bacome a spear till it connects. If you feel they'll
   throw something on you during the run, please remember SS VTSc. This is
   what it is good for. Do SS VTSc before 3 steps & Craig's back to normal
   again.
   From here you can -

   Block - punish the move if its unsafe.
   Reverse it if they throw something safe.
   Remember, SS to their weaker side or you may be hit during the SS 
   movement with tracking moves. Just do it 2-3 times with caution to get
   the feel of their style & soon you'll get rid of those stupid turtules. 


Using the tackle after some frame advantage:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Though most of the time, tackle will come out from d/b+3+4, SS+3+4 etc..
but you'll come across situations when the opponent is too careful with
his shot selection & mixes offense with defense well.
You'll see he'll stop you from throwing a tackle, always. He'll be hunting
for the VTS and similar stuff that leads to tackle.

So what about them?
You know there are some moves that cause a minor stun on hit, CH or block.
Here's a small list:-
CH d/b+2
(f+2), d+1
d,d/f+4
d+1--> Block or hit
4
These are just for example. Let's start with CH d/b+2. You've been knowing
a CH d/b+2 only guarantees a d/b+1. What if we leave that small tick 
damage for a while( small damage, nothing to cry about ) & replace it with
a 3+4, 1+2 as fast as we can. It can work for the first time since they 
are on the backfoot after eating d/b+2 as CH. In most cases, they don't 
retaliate. Although they may escape the tackle, but won't interrupt it. 
They always stay back after eating it. Same applies for other similar 
moves too.
Got it? what i'm trying to say? This trick really makes those extra smart 
players piss too. Try it, it'll work for you too. This is the another 
thing to be mixed with the movements.


Tackle as an okizeme:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DEADLY, thats how i describe it. This is an opportunity you simply can't
afford to miss. Catches backrollers.e.g., after a 1+3 airthrow, they try
to roll away, just dash in a bit then 3+4,1+2. You'll BT mount them.
Tackle also catches tech sometimes.e.g., WS+4, They tech--> 3+4, 1+2
works here. But i still need to find the exact circumstances for it.
Here's a quick list of the situations where tackle can be used as oki also
Assume they're backrolling.
1+3 airthrow                     ---
VTS 2+4                          ---
1+3                              --- 
VTS+2                            --- 
CH d,d/f+4                       ---
If they break mount & roll back  --- *
qcf+1                            ---
CH (1,2),f+1                     ---

This should give enough idea. Tackle works better after these if there's 
a wall nearby. For * to work, a wall is a must. However, the tackle can
be escaped in certain situations.
                                 

That was all getting tackle connected. But we all know, they aren't going
to eat it everytime. They'll break it quite a number of times.
So what's the strategy for this part?
You might have noticed, if you're playing Craig to a decent level, most of 
the time tackle is escaped from close range.i.e., if you've just started 
it & it got connected, they break it. This part of tackle is escaped more 
than spear. If they break it, they can do quite a few things.
Remember if tackle is broken, Craig switches sides so don't get confused 
if camera angle becomes horrible. 
Here's a list of possibilities:-
1) They throw a WS+4 which is safe but reversible.
2) Some lows like d+1, d+4, or pokes which give them frames but if you're
   careful, they can be low parried or anyhow dealt with.
3) Throw some slow move or any move which requires a dash to put pressure
   on you----> Can be backdashed( d/b+3+4).
4) They sit there & do nothing. Time for you to attack & throw some d+4, 
   d+2,4, d+1+2, tackle etc. to make them sweat.

Now lets assume you've mounted them. They break the followups. What 
happened? Craig dismounted. They'd either stay there for a moment or roll
back. So we'd start with the first possibilty:
>> They're staying there. You throw a b+1. They either standup quickly & 
   block it or they do a sideroll & then getup. No results.
   You try to hit them with a low but they block that too. Sob...
   
>> Here's a common mistake most Marduk players committ.
   The foe breaks the mount.
   Marduk desperately runs for tackle again. They sideroll or stay there &
   the tackle whiffs. All this happens, most of the time, when little time
   is left or they can't think of any other strategy ;__; 
   The defense against this--> Just be careful when you see mount getting 
   broken. Even if you throw a tackle, if you're good you can still 
   SS VTSc before 3 steps & become safe. Trust me, however skilled your 
   opponent is, he won't live without throwing a kick on you &  from here 
   tell him who's baited?!!

>> And here's a common mistake your foe will commit, nearly everytime ;P
   They break the tackle. Craig's dismounted. From here---> Just dash a 
   bit & do 3+4 then immediately d/f to low parry the wakeup kick they 
   throw. Its like 3+4~d/f. Got it? Believe me, i've seen this thing 
   happening with some very good opponents too. If they understand this 
   trick, just mix it up with 3+4~3+4. It works.
   
>> Do some fake offense. Start a tackle from a d/b+3+4. Do the sidestep 
   from the tackle & do tackle again till you reach close to them & then 
   immediately do SS VTS cancel. They thought you're close so they'll 
   immediately getup & throw some kicks on you which you can block. 
   They're screwed. 
 
>> Next time they are a bit careful now so they stand immediately when 
   they see the same thing repeating. Its most likely to happen like this:
   you did d/b+3+4,1+2---(Running) SS VTS, 1+2... They stand up 
   immediately rush towards you but you cancelled it again. They guessed 
   wrong 2nd time & throw something which you can still deal with.

These tricks work most of the time if they try to backroll too. Try to mix
these in this situations & you'll yourself see it working here too.
On the same topic, ssing right during tackle avoids their wakeup kicks 
most of the time & chances are you'll get a BT mount!!. Just suppose you 
ssed during tackle and they throwed the kicks before you cancelled the SS 
VTS. You'll still evade them. 

Keep mixing them but it may take some time to understand their style. Be
careful about your shot selection, throwing tackle etc. They can be smart 
but not too smart for Craig to handle.


Lets talk about some stategies after you had sucess with the mount. Lets
start with 1+3. After this hits you stand on their left with their belly 
towards you. From here you can try :
  A d/b+3 as a safe low.
  A d+4 is also good, it hits them with their back turned if they tried
  to roll away. Also, it stops any wakeup kicks etc.
  A d+1 to retain pressure, but can be beaten by the wakeup kicks.
The list is too long.....anything that works for you is fine. These 
moves work after successful 1+2,3+4 also.

2+4
After you had success with this Marduk stands in front of the opponent's
legs. Here, most chances are your opponent will getup & block anything
you throw in. I myself like using u/f+3+4 as on block it doesn't give 
frames & is a good bait for reversals too. There are too many options you
may use. Keep playing & you'll understand what & when to use.

2~1, 1~2
These are mostly used followups since they are used much in high level
matches. Since experts see the 1+3, 2+4 easily this is somewhat hard to 
guess. After 1_2~1 you stand just next to them on their right side, their
belly towards you. Similarly with 2,1~2 you're on their left.
After these you can try d/f+2, almost unstoppable if not guaranteed since
it is fast & can't be interrupted with wakeup kicks & if they try to roll
away they'll be eating this BT! Even safe if whiffed.
Condition them with it & then go for some mixups such as:
d/b+4-- Most of the time they'll lay there on there on the ground 
        expecting d/f+2.
d+1  -- They know they can't interrupt d/f+2, so they'll getup immediately
        to block it & it's time to throw this out. They block it & most of
        the time they don't attack afterwards so giving you a chance for 
        some throw or low guessing games. 


 
                           ================
                           EVADING TACTICS:
                           ================
                        d/b+3+4_SS+3+4_d/b+1+2 

The reason i've made this section is Craig's movements have a major role 
to play in his game. You cannot just sit back and wait for them to committ 
mistakes. You'll have to train them to take chances & it is the area where
Craig excels. In fact, he also has a good forced tactic game & Craig's 
movements are made for this purpose. I feel, no other character has got so
good spacing & evading moves as Craig has.

There are 2 movements & 1 single hitter that work as a base for all his
evasion & retaliation.
>> d/b+3+4
>> SS+3+4
>> SSR, d/b+1+2
All of them are equally good, let's discuss them one by one.

>> d/b+3+4
Ever heard of the phrase *PULL BACK--ACTION*, lol. This is the one.
Craig backdashes a few steps, stops & remains there for a second or two.
The whole animation is unsafe along with the movement, but that won't be 
a problem if you know how to use it.
This move is used to get away from those tight situations, pitbulls who 
keep thriving pokes, jabs etc on Marduk plus forcing them to attack on him
by conditioning them with the fact that Craig is vulnerable during the 
stance.

The question here will be, how to start with it? Here's an example:-
Consider you're against Marshall & you're blocking his moves.
He throws: d/f+1, 1, 1, f+1+2-*

* Indicates the point where d/b+3+4 should be done.

In the above example, he did, d/f+1 then jabs & finally went for 
pressuring on you with f+1+2 but if you do the backdash exactly at that 
time you'll make that move whiff & runaway from him. Got it?
Some similar examples:
Bryan_Bruce * 3,2,1
Julia WS+2,*1,1
Devil *b/f+2,1,2

If d/b+3+4 is done from close to mid range or preferably after a normal
backdash( b,b,d/b) it works even better.
Watch out for those long range, fast moves like Bryan's f,f+2, Julia's 
f+1~3, Steve's f,f+2 etc. These moves are fast plus got range. These moves
can catch Craig during the run, so beware of backdashing them.

That was all about evasion. Now the question will be how to retaliate?
I've put some moves here. Not all, only the ones that fit into the 
situation.

When Craig backdashes an attack correctly, you have:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) 1+2:-
   The obvious choice. Best to use when you're too far that none of your 
   moves can connect. Also useful, if the camera angle screws you.

2) 3:-
   Almost a replacement for the above one if Craig isn't too far or say 
   the opponent's withing the range of WS+3. Works best when-
 * You're in mid range after evading their attack.
 * If you've evaded an advancing move or series of moves.
 * If there is a wall behind Craig. However, this situation can be 
   dangerous for him too.
   One of the best retaliating moves.

3) d/f+4:-
   Everything same as above except this move has got long range. More 
   useful against Marshall's dragonslide, SLD_PLD Leis etc.

4) 2:-
   Works strictly when there's a wall behind or when Craig's still close 
   after the backdash. 

5) f+2:-
   Only use if you're teasing them. Still safe and sometimes outpriorizes
   other moves.


When Craig backdashes unnecessarily or if they rush towards him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) SS+3+4~3+4~3+4:-
   Needless to say, you'd like to finish things safely if you've any 
   doubts in mind. Be carefull during the SS movement. 

2) 1_4:-
   It will stop them most of the time, better throw 1 only because 4 is
   horrible on whiff & can be ssed either side. If 1 hits it gives you
   frames!!!

3) u/b+3+4:-
   Looks stupid but really works in open areas. Evades some chain strings.
   Another way to endup safely if you're feeling dry.

These are a few possibilities. I don't want to make things long 
unnecessarily. Start using it & you'll understand the timing for it with 
experience.


>> SS+3+4
   Looks almost similar to king's SS+2+4, but has got much more utilities
   than that. First of all, here's a list of various ways to perform the 
   big VTS sidestep:-
   3+4,SS
   SS+3+4
   d+3+4
   During tackle ss either way ( Before 3 steps )
   d/b+3+4,SS
   
   You get every move as from the normal VTS. More effective if ssed to 
   foe's weaker side. It is used for baiting as well as turtuling. From 
   here you can have following options:-
1) 3:-
   Just amazing if u ssed correctly. Even if camera angle confuses you can
   still launch them nicely.e.g., Marduk's at a distance. He goes into VTS
   stance (3+4). Heihachi sees this & throws out a f,f+2. Marduk SSLs
   instantly & throws this move. Heihachi's launched!
   A 2 will also fit well in this case, but the choice is yours wether you
   want more or less damage. It's upto you.

2) 1:-
   In case you ssed from far & didn't cancelled the stance & they rush to
   you, throw it out. Again it puts a break to their aggression. But don't
   even think about 4. It whiffs horribly in most cases & what will happen
   next, I think I need not tell.

3) SS+3+4~3+4~3+4:-
   Again, a lifesaver. Used in thight situations as well as for baiting.
   Condition them with it a several times & make them feel that you're 
   safe after the movement. From here you'll have really good 
   possibilities. Keep reading!!

4) 1+2:-
   Yeah! Now you've got them. After you made them understand that SS VTSc 
   is safe, they won't rush to you, so you've getting a chance. Keep 
   dancin & throw this baby out from time to time to see them pissing. 
   Really works! But be aware you don't do the movements  too close or 
   you'll be sorry at the end of the day.

Besides this also use reversals, pokes such as 4, d+4, d+1, d/b+2, f+1+2 
etc after the cancel to keep them guessing.
Also it is not necessary always to so SS+3+4 stuff only. The main thing 
is the sidestep movement that you can get in various ways. All the ways
mentioned earlier to do SS+3+4 have the same purpose plus can be cancelled
by SS+3+4~3+4~3+4. Keep playing with it to know how good this movement is!


>> SSR,d/b+1+2:-
Though most people will complain that its unsafe, i say it isn't that bad.
Its -20 on block, but it looks worse only on paper. Since it pushes so far
on block it isn't easy to punish Craig after this. Only really long range
moves will catch Marduk after this. Even the Mishimas have troubles
punishing him with a EWGF. So don't be afraid to use it from time to time.
But then the question is how to use it? First of all, what this move's 
good for:-

1) Has a ministep to right during the animation.
2) It can have amazing priority over opponent's attacks if you time it 
   right by bringing it out of a SSR.
3) It pushes BACK on block, not easy to punish.

This move can evade jabs and most mids if you do it correctly. You don't
even need a big ss for it to work. A brief ss to right can be good too.
Marduk seems to avoid them & sends them up in the air. The only drawback 
is you may launch them off axis most of the time. That will not be a 
problem if you know the combos. Some of them are:-
d/b+1+2, U/F+4, d/f+3,d+1,2       : 70 
Easy & damaging. My favourite if they are launched off axis.
d/b+1+2, U/F+4, d/f+3, 1, f+2+4   : 74 
Another good combo to start with. Good thing about both of these is you 
can easily change the ender by judging wether they're launched properly 
or not.

This move can be used after a SSL too, but this way you're sacrificing its
evading property. SSL is used against those characters who have weak
tracking to their right. One good thing about SSL is you can be sure of
launching them nicely. Here's a list of possible situations which can
provide you the opportunity to do SSR, d/b+1+2.
Unless i say, assume the following moves to be getting blocked. Just SS
after them & throw it out:-
d+2,4
f,f+2
4
f,f+1
1+2
WS+1
WS+3. If they don't punish it.
f+1+2--> Normal hit.   *
d+4----> Normal hit.   *
During tackle,SSR+3+4~3+4~3+4
1,2
f+2,1
* f+1+2 & d+4 do not provide frames on hit. :(

If you haven't understood it yet, have a look at this:
Craig throws--> d+1, SS+d+1, SS+d+1, d/b+2. A turtuling opponent blocks
all of them. When you keep throwing these things that keep you in even,
he'll certainly frustrate & throw a WS+4_d+2. From here rush and do:
* A low parry if he becomes predictable with d+2.
* SSR, d/b+1+2. Yes, it can evade those *EXTRA* safe generic WS+4s too!
  Believe me, i've stolen many matches with this.
Still not getting my point? See these:

Devil hits you with a CH b,f+2,1,2 of which you escape the stun by
tapping f & block the last 2. Then you rush to him. He throws a 1,1_b+4
but you do SSR, d/b+1+2. Devil's ass launched!!

You hit your opponent with a d+4. He knows Craig doesn't have any frames
after it & tries to counter you with a *Magic* 4, d/f+4 etc but you do
SSR, d/b+1+2 & he's launched.

You hit your opponent with a 2,1. Then you try to do qcf+2 but you mess
up & d/f+2 comes out. Opponent sees this & rushes towards you but again
the sway hammer comes out ;P

 
As you can see, the emphasis is on throwing this move after getting a
move blocked, more preferably the ones that don't give frames so they
attack after blocking them & you sidestep & punish =P. Just don't make
a pattern or they'll understand it. 


 
d/b+1+2 is also helpful after quickrolling. Just getup from the ground ss
to the side you tech (preferably to your right), then bring it out. It 
works sometimes. Do it as: Quickroll to right--SSR,d/b+1+2.

This is another move besides those movements which is used atleast once in
a  round. If you haven't started to use it, just do it to see the 
difference this move can create.     


 
3+4~3 & 3+4~4: FASTER WAY TO DO WS MOVES:-
=========================================
Did you knew about 3+4~3 & 3+4~4? Well, most of you certainly would be
knowing. It is a faster way to do WS moves. The 3+4~3 has the use in the 
case of tech traps whereas 3+4~4 is used for offense purposes. First of
all how to do it. Its not complicated. As the command implies, you have
to do it as fast as you can. The faster you do it, the better you've 
learnt it. The best way to check wether you've learnt it or not is by 
trying this combo: u/f+4, 3+4~4. If you're able to do it, you've learnt it
a bit.
The less you see the stance animation, the better you're doing it.

3+4~4: is useful for offense purposes, CH hunting. If you mastered this,
       you'll certainly have an edge in your offense game. Since it is 13
       frames its good for practicing. Also it is useful for punishing 
       close whiffs.Keep practicing.

3+4~3: It has its use in various tech traps situations, big whiffs etc.
       Also used to punish a move which has got slow recovery after
       backdashing it.


However, these moves aren't too practical. Most players do not incorporate
these in their matches. Keep practicing them & use them only when you are
too confident with Craig. You can still play good if haven't mastered them
but they are a bonus skill which can be seen in matches.

 
More I'll add as ideas come to mind. It isn't easy to put everything in
words. I know people don't like to see things too long. For that reason
I've also made a pokes & mixups section. See it & tell what are the things
still to be added. :)



==========================================================================     
                           POKES & MIXUPS:
==========================================================================

Saying Marduk is a turtule it doesn't mean that he cannot poke. Given a
chance he can poke to a degree which is above many others. First of all
here's a list of moves that come to mind when switching to offense with 
him.
 : 1,d+2
 : d+4
 : d/b+2
 : 1+2
 : Tackle itself.
 : Throws.
That is only for an idea, these things come to mind when we try to counter.
But if we try to see in depth, Marduk too has got many options to be 
called as his mixups.In the following list unless i mention assume the 
moves to be hitting them. If I say a move is blocked I'll put a [B] after
that particular move. I've made the list containing the only moves that 
work for me, but I'm pretty sure they will work for you too if you haven't
played Marduk yet or if you haven't used them in matches. 

The list is like this
Any move=( Equal to shows options we're going to have after the move hits
or is blocked.) Mixups which are combined together.e.g., f,f+1_2. The 
sense here is to throw out f,f+2 as much as you can till they duck, then 
when they become predictable throw a f,f+1. Since f,f+2 is fast, safe on 
block, & UNREVERSIBLE, you can abuse it to a level.Here these moves are 
grouped because they look more appropriate to use after a dash. You can 
yourself understand by looking at the groups. So, here we have them...

 These mainly include the ones that knock them down. The main emphasis of
 this section is to train them to eat the guaranteed followups then going
 for the mixups next time. Also, I won't mention the condition for a same
 mixup everytime. You'll understand yourself as you'll see.
 Remember, these are ONLY mixups, won't work everytime.

 MISC.
~~~~~~
 These only give you an idea about how a move has most chances to work.
 Don't try them too often or you'll be predictable.

 * After you are getting up & teching to your right :
   SSR, d/b+1+2

 * SS+3+4,3
   Works mostly if you haven't used it before. Use it in every 2-3 rounds
   to not getting predictable. I don't understand why but they eat it 
   nearly most of the time. You can use it even if you really ssed them,
   the combos still work fine. From back use any d/f+1 combo after 
   launching them with it. NEVER try to use ss+3+4,4, you will be 
   whiffed MOST of the time. Instead you can use 1 after ssing if you 
   want to go safe.
  

  * If they turtule too much, go for a little offense:
   d+4, d+4, d+4_d+1+2
   I assure you it works . Mostly when there is only little time left  OR
   You have only little health left. You see, you have nothing to lose
   from here. Either you'll eat jabs or you'll be launched, either way 
   you're going to lose, then why not try it out?



==========================================================================
                                 COMBOS:
==========================================================================

What a fighter is without his proper set of combos? So here we have them.
Most of the combos have been taken from the TZ forums--Craig combo thread.
Apart from these others have been put from various vids which I saw. Most
of them are self explanatory besides a few which have a spcial note 
besides them.
Other than that for combos where ?? is mentioned, means damage is unknown
at the moment, will be fixed soon.
They are like:

Juggle starter
= juggles        damage       Notes if any. 
In the following combos 3+4~3+4 will be referred as: VTSc



f,f+1+2

=========================================================================
                           MARDUK SPECIAL:
=========================================================================

This section includes combos that work on Marduk. However, there are
some which can work on Jack too. The ones I know i've mentioned, others 
I'm not sure wether they work on Jack or not. Give some time & it'll be 
fixed too.

f,f+1_CH d/f+3,d+1_CH f+3_d/b+1+2:

= d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, f+2+4     : 77_89_88_84
  Works both on Craig & Jack.

d+1+2
= 2, d/f+3,d+1, f,f+1+2                     : 72   
= 1,2,VTSc, d/f+3,d+1, f,f+1+2              : 74

 Works both on Craig & Jack. These combos work
 from d/f+1 also.

d/f+1
= d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2   : 77
= d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, 1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2         : 70


For the first one d/f+1 must hit from mid to max range.
For the 2nd do a brief SSR to avoid whiffing d/f+3.
2nd one works both on Craig & Jack.


 
f,f+1
= d/f+3,d+1, 1,2,VTSc, 1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2    : 82
= d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2   : 85

2nd one requires brief SSR before f,f+1.


CH d/f+3,d+1
= d/f+3,d+1, 1,2,VTSc, 1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2    : 94
= d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d/f+,1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2    : 97
= d/f+3,d+1, 1,2,VTSc, d/f+3,1,(2),VTSc, b+1: 87


d/b+1+2
= U/F+4, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2            : 88
  Works on Jack, Marduk & GANRYU!!.
= d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2   : 92
= d/b+1+2, f+3, 1,2,VTSc, 1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2 : 89   *

* d/b+1+2 must be done from max range to make f+3 hit
  properly. Works on both Criag & Jack.                                      

SSL (f+2),1
= d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2   :89

These combos require some serious practice. As most of these aren't easy
to land to so my advise is to practice the normal ones first & when you
are comfortable with them then only go for these special ones.




=========================================================================
                               STAPLES:
=========================================================================

Just felt I need to make this section, so as to help people choose easily
what combo is best according to situation. 

d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, 1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2           :55
Note that it is the damage wihout launcher. All the following juggles are
mentioned with their full damage including launchers.
Just works fine from nearly every launcher except d+1+2 & d/f+1. Whatever
be the range, this combo will catch them. Practice. It looks hard at 
first but with practice you can master them.

2, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2: 66_75
Main staple from d/f+1 & d+1+2. Very good damage & average difficulty.Not
hard at all. Only bad thing--> The last f,f+1+2 might whiff if started
from max range.

1,2,VTSc, 1,2,VTSc, 1, f+2+4:                54_63    EASY
1,2,VTsc, 1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2 :                59_68    AVERAGE
1,2,VTSc, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2:           68_77    AVERAGE

Above three are the best when you've launched them from max range.Cover 
gaps very easily plus good wall carry too. These three are made only for
d/f+1 & d+1+2.

1, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d/b+4:                    51    AVERAGE
The only staple you're going to see from WS+3. Good wakeup games too.
Some people say all the WS+3 juggles are bullshitt on damage. Its true
BUT what they overlook is the positioning & various setups Craig gets 
after them. Here's a quick info on them:
WS+3
= 1, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, 1, b+1_d,d/f+4         : 52
2nd highest damage but doesn't guarantee anything afterwards.

= 1, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d/b+4                  : 51
= 1, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d+4                    : 48
= 1, d/f+3,1,2, b+1                         : 49
= 1, d/f+3,1, d+1                           : 43

If they try to roll away, free 3+4, 1+2. Note that no dash is required.
Just throw the tackle. After the d/b+4 ender juggle, if you throw the
tackle you get spear whereas with the others you get free backmount. You
can also try dash, f+2+4 backthrow but timing must be practiced.

If they stay there & don't move--> free f+4
If they sideroll--> SS along with them then f+4_d/b+3 or whatever.
If they throw wakeup kicks:
>> If its a low--> Low parry
>> If you expect a mid--> Block, then free d/f+1.
If they roll towards you--> free CH d/f+3,d+1.

= 1, d/f+3,d+1,2                            : 47
= 1, d/f+3,1, d+1                           : 43

Above 2 combos are good to end juggles if a wall is nearby. Wakeup games
become even more easier from these 2 enders. 


f,f+1+2
= f,f,N, d/f+3,1, d/f+3,d+1, b+1            : 69
Reliable, easy & damaging.
= SSR, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d/b+4                : 62
Same wakeup games as WS+3 juggle.
= SSR, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, 2,1                  : 63
If they roll away--> Dash f+2,1 (STUN) d/f+3,d+1 juggle. MAD damage.


d/b+1+2
= SSL, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, 1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2    : 83
Main staple & works fine from all ranges.
= SSL, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, 1, f+1+3_f+2+4       : 69
Reliable if they're launched a bit offaxis. Easy to do.
= U/F+4, d/f+3,d+1,2                        : 70
Reliable if Craig launches them awkwardly.


NON 3+4~3+4 STAPLES:-
---------------------
This part is for them who have difficulties with 3+4~3+4 part or wish
for more easier juggles.

d/f+1_d+1+2: (For d+1+2 increase the damage by 9 points).
= 1, d/f+3,1, f+1+3_f+2+4        : 51
Reliable from max range.
= 2, d/f+3,1, f+2,1              : 57
Main staple & nothing more damaging if you don't want 3+4~3+4 part.

f,f+1:
= d/f+3,d+1, f,f+1+2             : 64
= d/f+3,d+1, 1, f+2,1            : 64
= d/f+3,1,2, f,f+1+2             : 67  (1)

(1) Must be done from close range.

d/b+1+2:
= U/F+4, f+1+3                   : 62 Nothing easier than this.
= u/f+4, 1, f+2,1                : 70
= U/F+4, d/f+3,1, f+2+4          : 74 
= U/F+4, d/f+3,d+1,2             : 70 Most reliable id they're launched
                                      offaxis.
= d/f+3,1,2, f,f+1+2             : 74 Must be done from close.

CH d/f+3,d+1:
= d/f+3,d+1, f,f+1+2             : 76
= d/f+3,d+1,1, f+2,1             : 76
= d/f+3,1, d/f+3,1, f+1+3_f+2+4  : 77

f,f+1+2:
= f,f+1,2                        : 56
= u/f+3+4, Wakeup games e.g., After u/f+3+4
= b+1_d/b+4  : If they don't sideroll.
= Groundthrow: If they sideroll.
These are the choice of lots of Craig players who like guessing games
setups. 
These are some non-3+4~3+4 staples. If you want more just go & see
Wild Man X's "Tekken 5 Combo FAQ". You'll get all the good & easy things
there. 



=========================================================================
                               OKIZEME:
=========================================================================

First of all okizeme. Craig has got them, they're good but not too fancy 
as Ling or Nina. These bitches are the stars in this department.You can't
expect death just from an oki!! That being said, it doesn't mean Craig's
too low in this list. He's got his own reasons to fear him. Here's a list
of moves which work as a oki tool for him in various situations with 
their reasons:

>> 3+4,1+2  : Craig's ultimate cheese. Its beastly when used as an oki.
              Not easily escaped at this moment. Best used when opponent
              is rolling towards walls from FCD or PLD position. Also 
              tracks quickroll sometimes & turns into spear, but can be 
              escaped at that particular instant.
              Use it & you'll understand the timing for it.

>> d+4      : Simply, the 2nd best move after tackle when it comes to oki
              purposes. Works in most situations like after successful
              mount, certain backrolls (Remember, it doesn't work if they
              rollaway from FCD.), after f,f+1+2 airthrow etc. Its safe 
              even if whiffs i.e., if they anticipated it & did no 
              movement at all. I'm not saying if its blocked!!

>> d/b+3    : Another baby you're going to see in Craig's wakeup games.
              Catches sideroll & backroll plus good range too. One of the
              best tools in Craig's okizeme. I wish it did more damage (
              Atleast as much as d+4.)

>> d/b+4 (On grounded opponents):
              This move's too good as a oki. Unfortunately, you don't get 
              too many chances to throw this out. It may be used after
              qcb+1+2, JH, 2+4 backthrow, 1+3 airthrow, 1~2_2~1 mount 
              followups, CH d,d/f+4 etc. It is also used after the juggles
              that thrust opponent into walls from far & you have to rush
              in. You get close & burst this out after the wall splat for
              some substantial damage. 
              Also, if you get to end some juggles with this move, you 
              still get some chances for wakeup games.
              
>> b+1      : This is only move that comes to mind when you want to play 
              safe. It is guaranteed after certain moves to become a combo
              but since its slow it can be siderolled or blocked after 
              getting up quickly. 
              It is more used as a baiting for reversals than an oki.

>> FC,d/f+4 : It has got loooooooooong range, very long range than any 
              other move Craig has, it catches opponent in so insane 
              situations where others would have possibly whiffed. Also 
              used after you entered into stance after a tackle was broken.
              They are still there lying still, expecting a tackle & you 
              surprised them with it. Not easilly siderolled. Plus if 
              you've thrown the opponent into the wall after any juggle 
              that they are too far for any move to reach, it comes handy
              there.

>> d/f+3,1,2,VTSc:
              Yes, you're seeing it right. The reason i've haven't 
              mentioned d/f+3,d+1 is that d/f+3,d+1 is unsafe if whiffed 
              whereas it isn't. If they guessed wrong, they eat it for 
              some good damage. Also since you're doing 3+4~3+4 after this 
              chances are you will float them to some juggle if they getup
              stupidly & if they predicted it & didn't getup, you'll still
              be safe because of 3+4~3+4 part. You don't have this 
              advantage with d/f+3,d+1. One of the time to use it:
              You blocked Marshall's FC,d/f,d,d/f+3, do u+3+4 (I'm saying
              u+3+4). He's there right in front of you from where you can
              go for d/f+3.. if he commits mistake & gets up stupidly.
              I've just come to find out that d/f+3,1,2,VTSc catches
              all types of backrolls too. Be it any kind of grounded
              positions, just chase them when they're rolling
              away & throw it out. I do this combo:
              d/f+3,(1),2,VTSc, 1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2 : 52
              Good chunk.

>> d/f+3,d+1: Having said that, it doesn't mean that this move hasn't got
              it chances. d/f+3,d+1 is useful in those situations where 
              they are in a position to backroll. If they didn't do that 
              & getup wrong they'll be eating some nice 60+ damage.
              Some situations to use it:
              I've mentioned d/f+3,d+1 with $
              f,f+1+2, u/f+3+4, $
              CH d,d/f+4, dash $
              WS+2, dash $
              1+3 airthrow, $
              More of it has been covered in Pokes & mixups section.
              In case you don't know the juggle from behind:
              d/f+3,d+1, 2, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, d/b+4.
              d/f+3,d+1, 1,2,VTSC, 1,2,VTSc, 1, b+1.
              Thats the ones I use, if you know something else better than
              that, mail me & I'll put them here.

>> f+4    :   It is a similar mixup with the above one and it is good for
              hitting them as long as they are on the ground. Some key
              setups for this move. Assume they aren't siderolling.
              WS+3, 1, d/f+3,1, d+1             $
              WS+3, 1, d/f+3,1,2, b+1           $
              f,f+1+2, u/f+3+4                  $
              1+3 airthrow                      $
              f,f+1+2                           $
              Various successful mounts         $
              2+4 throw                         $
              1+3 throw                         $
              VTS 2+4                           $
              These are some keysetups for this move. They should be mixed
              with d/b+4_d/b+3_d/f+3,d+1 for making it work.
              Remember, however bad it is, its Craig's fastest ground 
              hitting attack. 

>> u/f+3+4:   If you just throw it out on a grounded opponent, 99% of the
              time they'll sideroll & avoid it. Maybe they can throw wake
              up kicks too. It's used mostly after any juggle ending with
              d/f+3,d+1. Just dash a bit and u/f+3+4. If they getup wrong
              way they're gonna eat it & as it affects crouchers, you get
              some follow-ups too. It also worked for tech traps in 5.0 
              but no more in 5.1. As said with b+1, this move too is not 
              used with the sense of hitting them but to make them block 
              it & getting some guessing games from there.
                        
>> d+1:       Same purpose as u/f+3+4 & b+1. Make them block it to retain 
              pressure.

              
Besides these stuff there are some other things too:

Ground throws, catch sideroll.

b+4 stops any spring forward attempt.
Also you can avoid it by d/b+3+4, SS stuff. It easily evades it.
 
If the opponent is in FCD position & tries to roll towards you, you can 
try d/f+3,d+1 which will hit as CH & they'll be launched. 

SS+2, b+2 are just used against backrolls. Very rare. Only if you're
feeling dry.

These are just the basic stuff, I'll add more stuff as things come to 
mind.



=========================================================================
                                 TECH TRAPS:
=========================================================================

Basically, Craig players do not rely on tech traps much as he had many of 
them in 5.0 but most of them do not seem to work in 5.1. Also, with the 
ones he has you yourself have to guess which side opponent is going to
quickroll as Craig doesn't have any moves that catch a tech to both sides
except u/f+3+4( Only in short juggles & in 5.0 ). For the sake of 
completeness they are being mentioned here as it is a 5.0 FAQ.hehehe....
 
First of all u/f+3+4 stuff.  ( Taken from Valestyle_G  Craig thread from
                               Arcadepimp. Big thanks..)

(launch) 2, 2d+1+2 (opp doesnt move) uf3+4.           50dmg+21dmg "71dmg" 
(launch) 2, 2d+1+2 (opp rolls side) uf3+4, df3 1d+2,  50dmg+59dmg "109dmg" 
(launch) 2, 2d+1+2 (opp rolls back) dash forward, df3 1, 1 2 vtsc* 1, f+2+4
                                                      50dmg+44dmg "94dmg"
Pretty damaging, huh. Yes it is. But bad news it doesn't work in further
tekkens. CRY........

More stuff:

f+3+4_ 3+4~3 catches tech to Marduk's left.
d/b+1+2      catches tech to Marduk's right.

You can put try any of the above after any juggle ending with f,f+2_f+1+2
_1,2, etc.
you can always replace f,f+1+2 airthrow in any juggle with f,f+2 & f+2+4
with f+1+2.
Since room is needed for these stuff to work, so they won't work with
short juggles. For the 3+4~3 & d/b+1+2 you need to do a dash forward
( f,f ) to make them work.
I'll list some of the combos where these tech traps may work. For the
f,f+1+2 combos which you can replace with f,f+2 just reduce the damage
by -15. I haven't checked the damage for f+1+2, will be put here soon.

I'll mention the damages for some of the combos. The list will be like
this:
Any juggle       Opponent teching to          Opponent teching to
                 Marduk's left.               Marduk's right.

= d/f+3,d+1, f,f+2                        f+3+4_ f,f,d/b+1+2 

By now, I'm sure you'd have got the idea behind this. You can always
replace f+3+4 with f,f,3+4~3. However, I'm not sure wether the 2nd one
is safe on whiff or not,i.e., you might eat wakeup kicks if they do not
do any movement.
All these tech traps can be escaped by backroll & can be avoided by
sideroll.

OTHERS:                   ( Taken from Marduk tech trap thread from 
~~~~~~~                     TZ forums.)  

f,f+2           
= If they tech to Marduk's left--- f+3+4
= If they tech to Marduk's right---f,f,d/b+1+2
= If they back roll ---------------f,F+3+4
= 3+4,1+2-->If they tech to any side. You'll land a spear most of the
  time. Doesn't work if they backroll.

WS+4
= If they tech to Marduk's left---f,f+1
= If they tech to Marduk's right--F,d+2+4_1+3
= If they backroll----f,f,3+4~3 or f+3+4.
= 3+4, 1+2-->If they tech to any side (Escapable though :()


After any wall splat (The most basic form.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
= 1,2-->Hopover the opponent & immediately do d+1. He'll be backturned &
        your d+1 will hit him. After that WS+1_4 becomes uninterruptible.
        Its safe even if he remains there & doesn't getup. 
        The hopover tactic can also be replaced with a perfectly timed
        groundthrow attempt.



After a wall combo:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
= SSL, d+2+4_d+1+3    (Only if they tech to Marduk's right.)
= SWR, d+1, d/f+3,d+1 (Only if they tech to Marduk's right.)



If they are grounded & start to backroll:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
= dash d/f+3,(1),2,VTSc, 1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2 : 52
  Only if the opponent is rolling away from KND or SLD position.

= dash d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, 1, d+1 (Damage unknown).
  Only if they're rolling away from PLD or FCD position.

                     ANTI-CHARACTER STRATEGIES
=========================================================================

These are some anti-character strategies i've come upon with. Just random,
not all of them. Only the characters which i come to play against, have
seen or heard etc. These are not complete so expect it to be complete in
near future.
The purpose for making this section, as i've seen or understand, most of 
Marduk players lose to their opponents most of the time coz they don't
know how to punish oppoent's blocked moves or they don't have a strategy 
against them. They just overturtule or abuse the tackle without applying 
any sense behind and as a result, lose matches, get disheartened &
gradually come to lose interest in this character.
I'm sorry to repeat this but i have to say: PLEASE, know who your opponent
is & learn to punish his blocked moves. Craig can do this to a decent 
level, if not wonderfully, which could be key to victory sometimes. This 
section is all about that, to help you against cetain characters which 
you're going to read below. For the characters that aren't on the list, 
if you know about them, mail me or wait for sometime and they'll be addded
too. Anything wrong or incomplete, if found, please mail me about it so 
that i can correct it or add it.

Punishment lists aren't on the list, you can find them on the following

Vs Anna:
---------
Anna is a fighter made for close combat. Seriously, she really lacks some
good long range moves. First of all what you should expect from Anna 
that'll bother you:-
* d/f+1,2 pokes: Very abusable but suspectible to b+3+4 reversals plus
  random SSL d/b+1+2 can stop her. Do it less often.
* d/f+4: Only thing you can get if you block it is WS+4. So try to parry
  it when you know its coming.
* d+4,1: Her deadly mixup. Can be efective against Craig coz after the 1
  she can SS either side plus non-tracking ability of WS+4(Craig's WS+4)
  helps her too. The defense here is to use d/b+3+4 as soon as you see 
  her SSing. WS+1_1+2 can help sometimes. Same applies for her d/f+3,2 
  followups.
* Her weak side is to her right plus she lacks effective long range 
  attacks so d/b+3+4, 1_4 or d/b+3+4, SSL stuff will help you in this 
  matchup. 
* She has very good poking game so if you stay there in her grill for 
  long she will lead you to death.
There's nothing to say much here.



Vs Bruce:
---------
Bruce has a lot of weaknesses among which noticeable ones are:-
>> His 1,2 is NOT a combo, which means you can duck right after blocking 
   the left punch and can stop any guessing games from there with a 
   d/b+1. You have react quickly for this though.
>> No 1+2 escape throw. Got one in DR though.
>> No damaging lows.
>> His WS moves suck too, although he has got generic u/f+4.
>> No parries or reversals to counter with. Only his f,f+2 stops any 
   punch attack. But it isn't easy for him too.

His strengths:-
>> He's a 8 framer & a CH hunter. Most of the damage he does comes from 
   CH. Watch out if you get hit by his CH 1,2,1,2_3,3_1,2,3 & similar 
   moves that knock down near a wall, the damage you're going to recieve 
   is going to be MASSIVE, even bigger than Anna's wall game ;___;
>> Most of his lows, though don't do much damage, are safe on block. So 
   you have to parry them whenever you feel them to be coming.
These are just a few things you should be aware of when facing Bruce. 
Don't just sitback & turtule. Bruce's a pitbull. From the start of the 
round, till the end he'll be in topgear. Just watch out what he does & 
don't forget to punish.



Vs Bryan:
---------
This is a real fight, a REAL fight. The first thing:
d/b+3: You cannot punish this move on block. You simply can't. Best 
defense:
>> parry it whenever you know its coming.
>> Crush it with u/f+4. Can be done. 

Besides that, if you get hit by this move, don't mash buttons. He gets 
an uninterruptible WS+3 which he'll abuse. You can't do anything about 
it too. Its SAFE. His WS+3 is a move which he'll abuse a lot coz it:
Is safe.
Is fast (12 frames).
Tracks very well.
Isn't reversible( Atleast in Marduk's case )
Really cheap, isn't it? So reversals aren't worth trying in this matchup.
You'll be seeing this move everynow or then when facing Bryan. 
Bryan also throws 1,4 a lot. Its very fast but if he goes for 3,3, 
Here's what you can do:-
1,4,3   --- Jab punishable 
1,4,3,3 --- Duck under last 3 & punish with WS+4.
3,3 also come out from a slight delay. So be careful to rush at him.
If you get hit by 1,4_1,4,3,3 stay back & watch out for a d/b+1 or a b+1.
Chances are he'll throw any one of them. If you SSL his b+1, without any 
fear, go for d/b+1+2.
Only d/b+3 can't be punished on block but other lows can be. An e.g.,
Most Bryan's do this:- b+1( Blocked ), d+3...more stuff.
His d+3 can't be punished by WS+4 but by WS+1+2. Tick damage, isn't it?
That's why its emphasized to parry the lows whenever you know they're
coming.
Watch out for his f,f+1+2 throw, gives him free oki. Break it with 1+2.
After getting thrown by 2+4, d+2_2 can be done sometimes if he's not
careful.
Bryan is way ahead from Craig in poking war. He is very unpredictable. 
He doesn't follow a pattern in his matches. You'll have to turtule to a 
deeper extent & retaliate as soon as you see the openings. Good luck.



Vs Devil Jin:
-------------
The old school Mishima. The first thing to expect from him:
EWGF: Yeah, he may throw it at the start of the round to surprise you & 
if its done from a CD, it becomes a high crush( Please correct me if i'm 
wrong). How to get around it? 
--> d/b+1, d/f+1+2, d+4-They are all high crush. So use them from time 
    to time, but never make it a habit. d/b+3+4 can also work against it 
    sometimes.

Another move to be careful against is his WS+1,2. It launches on counter
& is safe on block. The 2nd punch in this string is hard to reverse. My 
suggestion, don't try it, rather go for moves like f,f+2, d+2,4, d+1, 
d+4_3 etc to keep him on the edge.

After you block his f,f+2 you can connect a d/b+3 without a dash.
As already said for all the Mishimas, dont let him do a WD etc. Be 
careful against his hellsweep-if done from a CD, it can give him a combo.
Really pesky. It can catch Marduk out of a d/b+3+4 too. At this 
particular point, if you did a VTS backdash & see him WD, you can stop 
him with d/b+1_1_4( I don't emphasize 4 much as its horrible on whiff.) 
His hellsweep stops Craig's SSR+d/b+1+2 too. But if you block it, make 
sure you kick the freak outta Devil with f,f+1 & make him rethink about 
it. However, WS+3 is more practical option.

Devil's WS+2 has got priorities too. He gets it for free when he blocks
Craig's d+4 but sometimes he'd backdash your attacks & throw it out to
launch you so don't leave any openings.

What's the best Devil can do to stop Craig when he's running for tackle.
Maybe an unblockable ( Most of the time its B+1+4, the big one ). It 
hurts. But you can avoid that too by SSing to your safe side. You may 
cancel the stance or remain there, no problem for you then. You'll just 
SS & get behind him & what you do next is upto you but make him pay for 
this.

In case you don't know in his f,f+3,1,3_4  the 2nd 1 can be ducked.  
Just don't make mistakes & don't feel like any pressure on yourselves.
If you panic DJ is one of the toughest ones but if you stay calm, he is
no problem at all. 



Vs Feng:
---------
Get ready for this chinese "Monk". He definitely looks so in his bald
customization =P. First of all get ready for b+1. Nasty move which is 8
frames plus combos on CH. Heck..he can CH Craig even if he's in - . 
Crush it with d/f+1+2_d/b+1 as they give you frames so you can go for 
some mixups afterwards but d+4 doesn't. He can CH you with a b+1 even if
you hit him with a d+4 >__<  If you are good youcan SSL it too( Sidestep
to Craig's left) & punish with some fast moves like f,f+2, jabs etc. but
DONT try going for a d/b+1+2. The b+1 has very fast whiff recovery & 
he'll block d/b+1+2 nearly every time. Just treat it like the fastest
"magic 4" everyone has & you should be okay.

Another menace he's got is his SS+4 which has nearly same properties as
Craig's d/b+1+2. It even stops his SSR,d/b+1+2 attempt. Parry it 
whenever you feel he's going for it. You can punish it with a FC+2. 
Really lame. Isn't it?
 
Feng's 3~4,3 is NASTY too. It becomes unblockable sometimes.e.g., 
Craig's grounded & Feng hits him with a f,f+3 afterwhich you try to 
backroll or quickroll and getup quickly. He sees this and throws this 
move in which you block 3~4 and the last 3 KNOCKS you down!!! Its 
difficult to mention every situation when he'll hit you with it but 
whenever you're grounded and see him doing that jumping move similar to
Lei's just stay grounded & let it whiff then immediately getup to block
the last 3 & punish it with FC+2. 

If you block his b+1+2, simply go for d/f+1 then choose the juggle 
according to range & your convienience.
If you block his f+4, you can stop any guessing games ( f+4,3_f+4,4) 
with a d/b+1.

Feng is fast but don't get disconcerted with his speed. It's going to 
be of less help to him against Craig. He has got some annoying stuff 
but he's no Bryan.



Vs Heihachi:
------------
Heihachi Mishima? He thinks he's cool? I say he's the dumbest Mishima. 
Why? His CD options aren't strong. Most of the stuff he will get from it 
is punishable.i.e, either block punish or SS. His CD+3_CD,D/F+3 can be 
ssed, first hellsweep doesn't knock down like Kaz or DJ and anything he
throws after it can be blockpunished. But you need to know that if he
starts his helsweep far & you blocked the 2nd low kick, you can't punish 
him. Its not that Craig cannot do this but its true for any character in
the game. 
 
That being said, so what is he good for? As with all the Mishimas-don't
WHIFF or the ALMIGHTY ewgf might come. But again he won't abuse it as 
his CD options aren't strong so he'll be using ewgf more for punishing
purposes than countering.

If he hits you with a d+1, just try to see what he does. Either it'll be
a d/f+4_WS+4 or a d/b+2. Reverse it or low parry it if you're feeling 
confident.

Craig's d+4 can be abused a bit as Heihachi cannot punish him with a 
launcher but he can crush it with a u/f+3,4. Besides that, use d/b+3+4
a lot as it avoids almost every move Heihachi throws. Be careful doing
this sometimes you may allow him to do WD, but you can stop that too
with d/b+1_WS+1. Don't worry. Most of the time its gonna be a mid only
as his lows aren't that good e.g., his Hellsweep doesn't knockdown, d/b+2
can be spotted & FC,d/f+4 is BADLY punishable. 

Just turtule with emphasis on SS and you'll make it out right against
Heihachi.





Vs Jack-5:
----------
Most people don't respect him due to his size & slow speed. Its true but
he packs hell of a punch to compensate for this & in good hands, he can
be devastating. He has lots of power to do the damage & his f+2,f+2
juggles make things easier for him. So let's talk something practical
about him:

* Jack-5 has got one of the deadliest throw arsenal in the game. He
  doesn't have any multithrows like King or Nina but again his setups
  make up for this. First of all:
  2+4: If he lands it, don't try to roll away or getup stupidly. He gets
  a free f+1+2,2 from behind. The damage is above 80 >__<
  Instead just sideroll & see what he does. He may do a u/f+3+4_SS+1_
  u/f+2 to retain pressure. No problem, let him do it, atleast you
  saved yourself from taking those extra damage points.
  Be careful even if you break that throw, he still gets an almost
  uninterruptible d/f+3+4 so don't attack afterwards. If you block that
  move, just d/f+1 all the way :)

  u/f+1+2: He can throw this out from FC too. If you don't know how to
  block the megaton punch afterwards just hold B (Sometimes it doesn't
  work. I do B+2,2,2,... until Craig blocks the punch) Some setups for 
  this throw:-
  d/b+1 (You recieve the hit) u/f+1+2
  u/f+2 (Blocked)             u/f+1+2
  SS+1  (Blocked)             u/f+1+2
  b+1   (You recieve the hit) u/f+1+2
  b+2   (Blocked near corners)u/f+1+2
  d+2   (You recieve the hit) u/f+1+2

  These are some of his setups. Break that throw with 1+2. You can block
  the megaton punch but if he doesn't go for this option, you recieve the
  normal damage.

  d/b+2+3: This throw won't knock you down but if he lands it, he gets a
  free d/f+3+4. And if he lands it near walls be ready to recieve some
  CRAZZZZZZY damage. Break it with 2.

  hcb,f+2: Very bufferable & he's got lots of setups for this too. Some
  of them are here:
  u/f+2 (Blocked) hcb,f+2
  b+1   (Hit)     hcb,f+2
  2,1   (Hit)     hcb,f+2
  b+2 (Blocked near corners) hcb,f+2
  These are just a few examples. There can be more too. Break that throw
  with 2.

Besides these he also has d/f,d/f+2+4 that juggles, 1+3 that can throw
into the walls, qcf+1 etc. You need to learn how to break every throw. 

* Jack's pokes are also a thing to watch out for. It is said he's a 
  unsafe character but against a good Jack you'll hardly see any openings.
  Amongst his staple pokes, things you should be most careful about are:
  
  d/b+1: Can't be punished on block. Two ways to get around it:-
  >> Low parry it.
  >> Crush it with u/f+4.
  You can SSR it, if you're REALLY good.

  WS+2: Should be punished with 1,2. 2,1 seems to whiff if you block it 
  from max range. I see most Craig players leave it unpunished for some
  reason.
  
  d+2,1: A natural combo plus high crush. If you blocked the first hit 
  you can low parry the 2nd. Can't be block punished.

  d/f+2: One of the best whiff & block punisher Jack has. In case you 
  block it, punish it with f,f+2_4_1,2. He doesn't eat f+1+2 for some 
  reason.

  u/f+2: A jumping punch Jack posseses to counter lows. If you block it,
  he still retains pressure so just stay back & try to read his mixups 
  from there.

  d/b+2: Pretty slow, but if you recieve the hit, do not backroll or
  getup stupidly. He gets a free f+1+2,2, again.

  f+1+2,2: One of his old trademark moves in which you can SSR the last 2
  & punish with d/f+1. The f+1+2 alone can be punished with jabs. However
  most Jacks use this string as a whiff punisher rather than beating your
  standing guard. They use it mostly when there's a wall on their left &
  Craig's right to prevent you from SSRing it but again you can reverse 
  the last 2 easily with b+3+4. Free mount, lol.

OTHERS: If Jack finishes a juggle with a f,f+2 (And he surely would)
just be aware of these things:

>> If you techroll, he gets free hcf,D/F+1
>> If you backroll, he gets free b,d/b,d,D/F+2_dash backthrow.
These are some of his key moves you'll face every now and then. If you
are okay against these, it means you're forcing him to take chances.
Then you'll see a Jack going for something else which could be really
tight for him if it's blocked. 

Now the question is what really are his downsides? Well...

* Almost every move Jack has can be SSR. The ones that track are f+1+2
  (Don't confuse, the last 2 can be sidestepped but f+1+2 TRACKS.), WS+1,
  FC+1+2, d+2 etc. of which the damaging ones are easy to read & punish.
  The faster ones are comparatievely safe but don't do much damage to
  worry about. SSR,d/b+1+2 comes handy alot against him.

* Jack is a BIG too, remember. So the good thing against him you can do
  the best juggle which you had troubles doing against normal sized
  characters.

* Jack is prone to Craig's repeated d+1s. He cannot SSR them since he's
  BIG.

* No reversals or parries to counter your moves. Marduk has the advantage
  here.

* Last but not the least, almost every move Jack has can be punished. Via
  blocking, parrying or ssing.

This is a battle for supremacy, to prove who's a BIGGER *fool*. If you 
make mistakes, you'll be a dogmeat in his hands but if situations reverse
he can be a *metal scrap* too :p

 
Vs Julia:
---------
Beware of this chick. She has an answer for your every move. First thing 
you should be careful about:-
f,f+1: When you block it, do NOT attack. A 1,2 might come which will 
launch you for some serious pain. Use any high crush after blocking it 
but don't get predictable with it. Also, be careful with turtuling in 
this match as she may mix the above 1,2 with Mad axes( hcb,f+2) throw. 
It got nearly same range & speed as king's and is very bufferable. She 
has lots of setups for this. A good Julia won't live without it. Break it
with 1+2.

Her best low is d,d/f+4, 3. It is one of her major whiff punishers too. 
If you block it you cannot launch her but punish with f+1+2 or f,f+2.

Use d/b+3+4 less often in this match as she can stop you with fast moves 
like f,f+1_f+3~1 etc. Use SS+3+4 stuff more.

The problem with Julia, as is with Marshall, most of her stuff is 
punishable. Learning to punish her blocked can clear your way to victory.
Seriously, she's such a character which cannot play safe all the times. 
She is a pitbull-killer but she'll have a rough time against turtules. 
Just be patient, learn to punish her blocked moves and she won't be a 
serious problem.



Vs Kazuya:
----------
Be ready to face the toughest Mishima, no two ways about it. He has some
good tools to break you in pieces. First of all:

* DO NOT WHIFF: I'm not saying avoid i said DO NOT as the all time great
  ass kicker EWGF will come. He's got some painful ones for Craig from 
  this. Keep it in mind.

* Be sure whenever you try a VTS backdash, it evades his move or you'll
  give him a chance for WD (Wavedash). It'll cover the gap even before 
  you think to throw a move when you get to rest. He has some *EXCELLENT*
  mixups from there. Some of them are:
  EWGF ;__;
  Hellsweep ( f,N,d,d/f+4)
  WS+1,2
  f,f,f+3 ( Crushes lows & gives him frame advantage. Hell.. more mixups)
  Stonehead grab (f,f+1+2)
  As you can see, it all looks SCARY when you see a Kaz hitting you with
  any of these. The defense--> d/b+1, 1+2, d+4 etc. Particularly about
  d+4 i want to say its a little safe for Craig to abuse as Kaz too can't
  punish with WS+1,2_WS+2 if you're at medium range. If you throw it from
  close WS+2 WILL hit but again the stun can be escaped by tapping f.

* Be careful even if you don't allow him to WD. His d/f+2 (14 frames) can
  CH you & the EWGF launch after it is a pain. Don't forget to punish it
  with 2,1_1,2 but if you blocked it from close range, he remains safe.
  His d/f+2 tracks too.

* He has a lot of setups to hit you with his WS+1,2. This move hasn't got
  range so he'll be least using it for punishing purposes. He'll himself
  make the setups for it to hit. Just like Craig's SSR, d/b+1+2. The only
  difference-- he'll duck and Craig sidesteps. Here's a list of his 
  setups. Assume the every move to be getting blocked & then he throws 
  this out:-
  b+1
  d/f+1,4
  d/f+2 (Close block)
  f+4
  u/f+3
  1,2
  b+2,4
  WS+1
  d/f+3
  f+4
  They are just some of his key setups. What he actually does is-- he 
  makes you block them & if you don't know wether any move is punishable 
  & throw something, he just ducks or SSes & launches you quickly. 
  Remember, this move is 12 frames so it launches even after a whiffed jab.
  He'll mixit up with some lows like Hellsweep, d+4 etc. This move is 
  punishable on block but no Kaz will throw 2 if he sees the previous 1 
  getting blocked. The defense against this can b--If you know Kaz won't 
  throw the 2nd punch after getting the WS+1 blocked, just SSR and try to
  see what he does. If you see him advancing again just SSR,d/b+1+2...
  damnit. It avoids his Hellsweep too. His HS doesn't track SSR,d/b+1+2 
 (Kaz's left). Biggest setback for him =) Be aware, don't get predictable.
  Seriously emphasized.

Against kazuya, you need to play it extra safe with little baiting. You 
can punish his mistakes or force him to do so but you will be on the edge
too. Just keep dancing around him with some safe moves, more lows 
(Poor combos even after a low parry unless you're near walls)
& SSR,d/b+1+2. He WILL eat it if he guessed wrong.



Vs King:
--------
King, in many ways, is similar to Craig. No, i shouldn't have said that. 
In fact, Craig is similar to king in many ways, for:
* Largest variety of throws though king has the largest number.
* Offensive push-- king's f,f,N+1+2 & Craig's 1+2.
* Irreversible moves-- Both of them have it in quite a number.
Besides these what's king really good for is Giant swing( f,hcf+1) & iSW
(f,f,f+2+4). These are the throws you're going to see every now & then in
King's game, even more than the hop kick. They are fast, have range,
bufferable plus give very less reaction time. You're going to have 
troubles breaking them if you haven't seen them much.

King's poking game too, is very good. Though looks conservative, but 
still very nice. Major tool for him to dish out damage, in which you're 
going to see f,f,N+1+2 much. Its fast as hell( 9 frames), guarantees a 
b+3 on CH but doesn't do any damage on normal hit or block. Be warned 
though, king still retains pressure so be careful while rushing at him
after it. This move can be SSR.

Another thing that gives King an edge, is his block-punish ability. He's 
damn good in this department so don't make any stupid mistakes against 
him. He will make you pay for it.

So what's the strategy against him? If you break those crazy throws
consistently, half the problem's solved. Remaining is his poking game 
which is suspectible to Craig's reversals. It'll take some time but 
you'll understand it. Play careful against King as he is a tough match, 
but don't underestimate Craig too.:)



Vs Lee:
-------
I'm not sure but his f+2 always goes under high. It goes under the jabs,
throws & other high moves.

He is known to be little down when it comes to juggling but that's true
only for any character other than Craig. Lee does have some mean juggles
for him even in the open terrain. So don't expect any relief even if 
you've chosen a no-walls stage.

Lee's lows don't do much damage. The ones that knock down are slow and
punishable. So what will he do to beat you? His strength is his amazing 
wall carry ability. Lee's famous for carrying bitches ( Sorry for saying
that) from one corner to another and with Craig's SIZE it gets even 
easier for him. Not to forget his wall combos are deadly too. They put an
icing on the cake. No one does so much damage so easily in the walls as 
Lee does. Also watch out if Lee is ending a juggle with 1,2 or 1,2,2, be
careful about getting up from ground. He's trying to setup a u/f+4 again 
to relaunch you. His u/f+4 will crush any low kick you throw & with its 
speed it'll beat out your mid option too. So never get fooled by this.

Lee's throw aren't spectacular either, but if he lands any he gets free
oki due to Craig's size ;__;
His f,f+3+4 doesn't combo like the one law has, though you need to be 
careful. If you tech after that throw, he'll relaunch you with a BK
(Blazing Kick, d,d/b+4). Though it'll happen only if you tech to your 
left ( Lee's right)

Against Lee, this is something you want to know. Its not easy to write
everything here. Rest things you'll learn with experience.



Vs Marshall Law:
----------------

Marshall has only 3 things good in his game:-
>> The DSS_DFS transition he gets in various ways.e.g., 1,2,DSS_4,3,DSS_
   b+1,2,DSS_SS+2,1,2,DSS & similar moves.
>> His f+1+2~D which gives him frames & guessing games.
>> His famous mixup of WS+2_WS+4_FC,d/f,d,d/f+3

Having said that, Marshall does has his share of weaknesses too:-
>> He has lots of problems tracking his opponents.
>> He hasn't got any long range stuff, so he's going to have troubles
   punishing whiffs.
>> He isn't good at block-punishing. Seriously.
>> Every bloody Marshall stuff is reversible, so its an opportunity
   a good Craig can exploit.

As said in previous faqs, his DSS_DFS stuff should certainly be seen with
respect as you can't do anything about those, just sit back & block. Its
an edge Marshall has above others. Wait for it to end, see the openings &
keep throwing tackle from time to time. But be aware he has a 15 frame
generic u/f+4 which will launch you out of it.

His f+1+2~D is frustrating but can be:-
>> Backdashed( d/b+3+4 )
>> Reversed
>> SSR, d/b+1+2
Also if you block it, chances are he'll go for a DSS 2+4 or FC,d/f,d,d/f+3.
You can avoid both things with u/b+3+4. If he throws the slide, his slide
will whiff & yours stomp will hit him. Be aware, he can float juggle you
with WS+4 if you become predictable.
I just found this strategy, though can't be used regularly. Most Laws
like to do f+1+2~D,WS+4~DSS stuff. If you are REALLY good you CAN 
SSR+d/b+1+2 his WS+4. Don't beleive me? I myself was surprised in the 
begining but it works. Just don't overuse it. 
Whenever he becomes predictable with f+1+2, just d/b+3+4 him. It easily 
avoids it plus if you're close enough, you can relaunch him with 3. 
Having done it 2-3 times he'll surely rethink about it next time.

His famous mixup WS+2_4~DSS and FC,d/f,d,d/f+3 should be u/b+3+4.
Seriously, u/b+3+4 is completely safe even if it whiffs against Law. So
 you get the following guessing games against him:- 
> If you feel he'll do WS+2_slide--> u/b+3+4.
> If you feel he'll do WS+4_WS+2---> d/b+3+4,3_1+2_d/f+4 depending on
  range.
d/b+3+4, u/b+3+4 is in order against his mixup. Avoids most of his stuff
from FC.
If you block his slide (FC,d/f,d,d/f+3), just WS+4,d/b+4. It will hit him
at first but soon he'll start avoiding it with quick sideroll. After this
he'll quickly getup & start throwing something on you:-
> WS+2--Punish with f+1+2_f,f+2 depending on range.
> If he throws a WS+4 & you're good, you can SSR,d/b+1+2 him.
> A slide--Punish with WS+4 again. Be careful don't parry it. He becomes
  grounded.

If he hits you with a 2,2 just stay back and try to see what he does next.
Chances are he'll throw a BT 2,2 which is uninterruptible but punishable
on block. You can reverse it too.
If he tries to be careful & does a 1,2 instead of that, still there are 
chances he'll throw either a d/f+1_d/f+4_d+4 and similar mixups 
afterwards. Reverse those too.

He has troubles tracking, so keep using SSR,d/b+1+2 from time to time. 
Marshall cannot punish it well, either he gets jabs or 4,3 only. 

d/b+3+4 is most abused movement against him, but if done from close he'll
catch you with a FC,d/f,d,d/f+3. Just be careful about that. Same applies
for SS+3+4 too.

Marshall has the upperhand in this match. He has speed, power but still 
there some areas which he lacks & Marduk can exploit them very well. If 
you understood his style, you'll have less troubles beating him.



Vs Paul:
--------
Ask any Craig player if he has troubles against Paul. I do not intend to
to say he's bad. He is very GOOD but if you're playing Craig at a decent
level, it won't be a very hard matchup.
First of all, against Paul you need to be careful about 2 things:-

1) DO NOT WHIFF: Be careful or be ready to eat a few qcf+2 & d+1+2. These
   moves are made for this purpose of which d+1+2 is 12 frames, so it 
   will catch you even if you whiffed those little punches ( d/b+1_FC+2),
   2,1 VTS+1 etc. All these moves do have good whiff recovery but against
   Paul this fact doesn't hold good. Also Paul's outclassed in his block
   punish ability due to this move, as it's 12 frames it can punish 
   Craig's d/f+1 too. He dont even need jabs for this ;__; 
   So what's the strategy for this? d/f+1. Simple as it is. It will 
   launch him everytime you blocked this d+1+2. Choose your juggle 
   depending on range.

2) DO NOT OVERTURTULE: Seriously, Paul's d+4:2:1+2( Falling leaf combo),
   SS+3 & his all time GREAT throws can break turtles instantly. So 
   don't sit back & do nothing. Do some fake offense-- use d/b+3+4 a
   lot( Saying so i assume you're applying your sense as well or a 
   f,f+2:1 will catch you), SS & keep throwing tackles from time to time. 
   If you block d+4--f,f+1 or standup quickly and d/f+1. Anything you 
   like but don't punish with WS+3. Its not an opportunity for this move.
   You need some big damage, don't you?

Paul has difficulty in tracking to his right too, so SSR,d/b+1+2 can help
but be careful if its blocked you'll be in some tight situation.
Against Paul you don't need a BIG strategy. We are seeing him from the
start of tekken so you can figure out with experience how to deal with 
him.



Vs Raven:
---------
Here we are against "impostor" Blade hahahahahhaaa...(*cough*).
Sorry for saying that, but cool looks aren't going to help much, don't
underestimate him though. Here's some random info:-
 
* His lows are really good, amongst which the first thing that comes to
  mind is his qcf+3+4. He can get some meaty damage from it. I'm not
  kidding. Have a look at this:-
  qcf+3+4, d/b+4, b+3 (tech), d/f+3, hcb+1+2.
  Pretty long setup and MASSIVE damage from a low!! -__-
  The last hcb,f+1+2 throw can be escaped but even if he doesn't do that
  he does nearly 70 damage till d/f+3. Annoying, isn't it?
  He's got some special for Craig from brief SS. The defense against it:
  Just block & punish with a quick standup d/f+1_d+1+2_f,f+1 (Do not try
  to parry it as its -41 on BLOCK!!). Rest lows are unsafe too, but you
  should be parrying them if you want more damage.

* His qcf options are pretty slow except qcf+3+4( 15 frames). Almost
  every other move he's got from it slower than 17 frames but he can
  use some custom strings in between like d/b+2,1 (i15), d/f+1(i14), d+2
  etc. So 1+2 can be used to stop him whenever you see him CDing. It even
  stops his SS games from there.

* You can do some rush games against him to as his *magic* 4 doesn't 
  combo on CH. His fastest CH is 2,4 of which both hits are HIGH & jab   
  punishable. His 1+2 is 15 frames. So 1,d+2_1+2_d+2,4 can come handy.

* His 4~3 is jab punishable on block but if he goes for 3_1 immediately
  after it he can stop you. Defense against it to duck sometimes but
  again he's a got a mid 4 after it but remember 4 cannot interrupt your
  jabs. So it goes on like this:
  4~3(Blocked)--2,1_1,2_1,d+2.----He can interrupt with 1_3
  4~3(Blocked)--2,1_1,2_1,d+2.----Jabs will interrupt him even if he 
                                  tries mid 4 afterwards.
  
* SSR,d/b+1+2 should be tried less against him as his f,f+3 TRACKS. Its
  hard to SS it left too as Craig is BIG.
  f,f+3 can catch you from your d/b+3+4 too, so be careful of doing
  VTS backdash. You can punish it with 1,2_2,1.

* His hcb,f+1+2 throw is very bufferable & he's got various setups for
  this. Here's a short list. Just assume every move to be hitting them
  unless i mention:
  d/f+1
  1,2
  d/b+2,1
  d/f+3
  f,f+3 (whiff) While you're getting up from ground.
  f,f,N+4
  Thats a small list about the various ways he'll setup that throw. Break
  with 1+2.

Even though he hasn't got any reversals or parries, avoid committing 
mistakes. He is an awesome juggler & kill you in no time. Not to
forget his wall game is DEADLY too. Be patient & don't do anything
needlessly. He isn't a SAFE character & can't win without taking chances.
So just sitback & don't forget to punish.





Vs Roger Jr.:
-------------
Roger's a all round funny character but she's (I said "SHE" as it carries
a baby in its pouch) no nonsense. She's a 8-framer & nearly half of her
moves are similar to King. She's got some annoying moves some of which 
are:-

* CH 1,2,1,2,1: Whole string hits on CH of which a good Roger won't do 
  the last 1. The first 4 hits themselves give her so much advantage that
  she can try anything she wants.e.g., FC,d/f+2, u/f+4 etc. CRAZY damage
  afterwards. Be careful, if you get hit by this move near a wall,
  chances are you'll be FINISHED >__<  
  Yes 1,2,1,2, u/f+3,3(wall) is a real juice for her. Don't eat it.

* f,N+1 is another annoying move (Not on hit but on block) which gives
  her some free stuff again.e.g., f,N+1(Blocked), f,N,d,d/f+1_FC,d/f+2
  etc. Not to forget, this move is dangerous on block near walls too, as
  again she gets the same the same CH 1,2,1,2 setup but you CAN see it
  coming plus its a high too. What a relief!

* Her d/b+1+2 (Kangaroo attack) is another move to watch out for. It's
  got amazing priority & goes under many of Craig's attacks, even under
  SSR,d/b+1+2 sometimes ;__; She can hit him out of tackle with it too.
  She gets some free stuff afterwards again but what you need to know is
  when you block this move she remains airborne for a some frames so
  juggling her after this move is a bit tricky. You'll have to time
  d+1+2_f,f+1 well for it or she'll just be floated. If you can't do that
  consistently do d/f+3,1 immediately after blocking it & do the juggle
  of your interest.

* Most of her lows can be seen on reaction and are punishable on block of
  which you should be careful about SS+4. Its the same move like Craig's
  d/b+1+2 in the end, part of her turtuling strategy. Punish it with
  f,f+1 only. Other things seem to whiff. 
  Her d/b+3 and d+2 can't be parried but can be punished with WS+4. This
  is a match where you should be trying to block every low than parrying
  it.

* Her grab game is awesome too. As i said she's a half "KING" so she has
  got some very nice grabs in the game of which f,hcf+1 & d/b,f+2 are the
  same grabs in the end. She will set f,hcf+1 in various ways so learn to
  break it. It can be techrolled too but if she throws you into a wall 
  the damage you're going to recieve is BIG.
  Her d/b,f+2 gives her free d/f+1+2. Its not because of Craig's size but
  its true for every character in the game...but who gives a damn about 
  other character. Its a CRAIG MARDUK faq. hehe..
  
* Lastly, be careful if she isn't ending her juggles with some obvious
  ender, chances are she's actually setting up u/f+3+4 tech-trap. If she
  hits you with it she gets free BT 3+4 to relaunch you. So be careful
  about it too.

These were some of the things you should be aware of. The problem with
Roger, as with most characters, is most of her moves are unsafe. Learn to
punish her. You don't want a Roger know you don't know how to punish
her, do you?





Vs Steve:  (Preliminary)
---------
Be very clear about it, if you're not playing Craig seriously & just for
fun, just stop hoping to beat him. If you don't know much about Craig,
playing with handful of knowledge, watched some casual vids & thought
you're done--> you're simply wrong. Craig's easy to learn, no doubt,
but playing him to a standard is a totally different issue. You need
every skill of yours *Razor sharp* to overcome this beast.Then will it be
easier to hang around him? :) Read on

* His d+1, d/f+1 CAN be SSR,d/b+1+2. Its true & after blocking a 
  f,f,f+2, this mixup becomes quite obvious so use it but i advise u
  again don't become predictable with it.
 
* 3+4,2_d+2 have to be blocked. You can't punish d+2 too =(
  If he goes for u_d, 1_d+1 mixups, you CAN stop him every time with
  1+2. He'll be briefly sideturned so you can attack but if he tries
  to throw anything from there, SSR,d/b+1+2 will take care of him.

* f,f,N+2 is his main tool to cover gaps. Its fast, knocks down on hit &
  TRACKS. Yes, it can stop your SSR+d/b+1+2 attempt so don't try it when
  you're at medium distance. He'll throw it out all of a sudden to
  surprise you. If you block it, just FC+2. That's all you get. Don't
  complain, others get a WS+4 only so that doesn't make much difference.

* Whenever you see him moving away from you & swaying from LWV stance
  to RWV (All those ******* hunchbacked stances he has), LWV to FLK &
  all that, either
  >> Keep your distance  OR
  >> Throw some tracking moves to keep him off-balance such as 1+2,
     d/f+1+2_d+4 (Particularly about d/f+1+2 & d+4 i'd say that they're
     all HIGH CRUSH so they'll stop him from going back to FLK. If you
     play against a good Steve you'll soon know why am i saying so)

* If you eat a 2+4 throw, be careful while you getup. A good Steve can
  f+2,1~b FLK 1,1,1,2 you to death.

* If you block his d/b+3_u/f+3,2 you get enough time to do a WS+3 but
  if you're feeling skillful you can f,f+1 him out of it too.

* His SSL (Hold 3) 1,1 is absolute DEATH. He doesn't even need walls
  for this so don't throw anything stupid when you feel like getting
  a chance, you'll be finished. This is a strategy abused even by
  scrubs. They'll constantly attack you and as soon as they feel you
  going to retaliate, they immediately do SSL 3* 1,1 & you recieve
  the the FREEZE stun!! The setups for this move are almost similar as
  Craig's so once you get the feel of it be careful about your shot
  selection.


I know its a paper war only but i've said what i had to say & it's all
true. A good thing after facing Steve is you become much confident against
other characters...hehehe.....Good luck.


Vs Wang:
--------
He is a "Parody" over other chinese characters. How can anybody fight
in the age of 105!! Well.. its true. Don't get fooled by his AGE, he's a
heavy hitter & can give you a very tough time.

* His WS+2,2,2: Last 2 can be low parried if you block the 1st & 2nd. In
  case it hits, you cannot low parry the last 2. A good Wang will shift
  to mixup which is either a delayed 2 or u/f+4. Better to keep blocking
  high till you can't guess it consistently. The 2 only hits, doesn't
  knock you down whereas u/f+4 will launch you. Keep blocking if he hits
  you with the 2 as he gets either a FC,d/f+4,3 or WS+4. Be careful about
  it.

* If you block his 1+3+4, don't attack. He'll CH you with a 1~1,1 & 
  launch you. Also this throw isn't escapable or duckable. You'll have to
  block it.

* His only 1+2 escape throw comes out of a CD (qcf motion) too. He will 
  CD and do a d/f+2+4. This itself brings Wanning Moon out. He'll mixit
  up with WS+4_FC,d/f+4,3_ qcf+2 etc.

* In his b+2,1 you can't duck the last 1 if you blocked b+2.

* He's got various ways to counter your attacks particularly b+1. It
  parries Craig's various irreversible moves too!! Its hard to give a 
  list of things it can parry so see to it what you're throwing on him.

* His f+1+4 combos plus catches tech too. Be careful he if he doesn't
  complete a juggle with f+1+2 or qcf+2 just stay there & don't getup.
  Try to see what he does.

These are just a few things. There can be more things too. Wang is the 
smallest thing in T5 but when he hits you the damage you're going to
receive is BIG. Just play smart :)





Vs Yoshimitsu:
--------------
Well, he actually IS very good but he may not be high on reputation as 
Paul, Steve, Bryan etc. The reason for this--He's not easy to learn,
juggles are hard to perform, got weird moves & most importantly isn't
good looking (Well, Craig's aint imposing either):p
These may be several reasons why people don't choose him as their main
character but once he gets into good hands he'll show you his STANDARD.
Here's a quick run on him:-

* d/f+2 & u/f+3: His staple launchers of which you might be knowing that
  uppercut(d/f+2) doesn't launch crouchers. Its fast & its best purpose
  is whiff punishment whereas u/f+3 is more than what it looks. Its fast,
  guaranteed move Yoshi gets after a low parry, a low crush (Yeah, every
  one knows that) & a high crush too, sometimes. Same as Craig's d+1+2
  at first but becomes a perfect high crush when done from a FC.

* His f,f+4 (Fubuki) is 8 frames, so it will punish even those moves 
  which others can't e.g., Craig's f,f+1_f+2_whiffed WS+1 etc. Its fast
  but IS risky for him too on block (-15) so you get free f,f+2 after-
  wards.

* His f+3+4 (Kamikaze) is one of his best whiff punishers. Decent speed
  & range, sometimes catches Craig out of a d/b+3+4 too so don't abuse it.
  The downside of this move is-->Its jab punishable IF its blocked up
  close. You can SS it either side too if you're good.

* His 1+4 (Flash) is actually a thing to be careful about. It can counter
  lots many moves including tackle, throws, spring forward attempt, mids,
  lows & some irreversibles too BUT loses to high priority moves & some 
  highs. Some staple setups which a Yoshi makes for it are (Assume every
  following move of Yoshi to be blocked):
  u/f+4: Main staple for him.
  WS+2 : He can flash from BT too! Be careful about rushing to him.
  b+1
  d/f+2
  f+3+4
  u/f+3
  BT 3 : BT flash again. You can LOW PARRY this MID!!!
  Wakeup kicks you throw on him when you're grounded.

  Here you might say i've mentioned some moves which are jab punishable
  on block then how can he counter your moves? That's bcoz *flash* has
  been awarded the priority to stop anything except guaranteed punishem-
  ent.e.g., After a blocked f+3+4, Yoshi will eat jabs but if opponent
  tries anything else besides that, he'll be countered. So never try to
  be greedy & do only the thing opportunity says. 

* His d/f+4 is still a fast move but doesn't track & is suspectible to
  Craig's b+3+4.

* His d/f+1,1,1,1 is a mhhm string so you can crush the 2nd hit with d/b+1
  _d/f+1+2_d+4 if you block the first.

* His FC,b+1_D/F,1 low unblockable *Sword sweep* can be crushed with u/f+4
  or evaded with d/b+3+4. 

* After eating a wall combo, don't tech. Just stay there (Most of the 
  time you'll be in SLD position--> Face down, feet away). Almost every
  Yoshi does a b,b+1,1 to catch you. Don't wait for it to be over. You
  can d+2 him out of it too. If you wait for it to be over & do anything
  afterwards, chances are either you're retaliation will be blocked or
  you'll be countered with the *FLASH* again.

* Do not overturtule. Doing this you're giving him a chance to do f,f+1+4
  ,d+1+4 *Suicide unblockable*. It will come all of a sudden to surprise
  you.
 
This was just a little info on him. There could be more things too. He's
one of a kind "Dark horse" in the game. You definetely can't outspeed him
so just be good & turtule a lot (Do not overturtule or you're leaving 
yourself open for a f,f+1+4.). That's it.

                              HINTS & TIPS:
=========================================================================

We've discussed so far about a character that is amongst most hated ones
and is loved only for one reason-He is easy to juggle. We've discussed 
various reasons how can he be good BUT you'll come across some situations
where you'll feel Craig's isn't exploiting the opportunity to its fullest
or say there are some holes in his game. You may even feel sometimes to
quit him =(
This section is about reducing the chances for this to happen, making
opponent take less advantages of his weaknesses & proving that picking up
Craig wasn't a bad decision at all. 
This section's about some tips & hints so that you play him to his 
fullest. O.K... Let's start with some advices.

* The most obvious requisite--Learn his movelist. Playing Craig with
  incomplete knowledge is even more dangerous. The better you know him,
  the better you play.

* Generally most players try to avoid 3+4~3+4 part in juggles. I won't
  force you to learn them but if you practice just a bit you'll 
  certainly see the difference.

* Most people try to use this combo after d/f+1:
  2, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, 1, f+2+4_f+1+3.
  Nearly everytime, the last f+1+3_2+4 whiffs. I am sorry but i've to
  repeat this nearly everytime--PLEASE, check the range from which 
  they're launched. This juggle requires nose-to-nose distance. Go to 
  practice mode & learn the various juggles that suit for various range. 
  With a little bit of practice you won't face this problem anymore.

* f+1+2_d+4 are the moves you'll be needing everynow or then in your game
  but do remember a thing that both of them do not give any frames on hit.
  After hitting with these moves just SS or backdash.

* Most lows you'll come across will be safe against Craig so better low
  parry them whenever you feel they're coming.

* b+3+4_b+1+2 reversals are UNCHICKENABLE plus free mount too. What else 
  do you want? Use them.

* O.K. you might say " Even if i low parry certain lows, what about the
  moves like Steve's f,f,N+2 which is only -11 on block & puts Craig in
  crouch? " FC+1_FC+2. They hit & give you frames. That's all.

* Don't confuse between the speed of Craig's d/f+1 & other character's
  generic hopkick. e.g., Paul's u/f+4. Craig's one is slower than Paul's.
  d/f+1 is 16 frames whereas u/f+4 is 15. So you won't be able to launch
  opponent after blocking a move that's -15. Simply f,f+2_4_f+1+2 
  depending on range. Don't get disconcerted. Craig's not the only victim
  of this curse. There are others too.

* d/f+1 has the same range as King's d/f+1,2 or Kazuya's d/f+2. So if 
  you're DEAD sure you're blocking a move that -16 or above, go for it &
  avoid f+1+2_f,f+2. No matter, how much damage you're going to get from
  d/f+1, once launched, its far better than f+1+2 or f,f+2.

* Craig's u/f+4 is made for low crush purposes. Its totally SAFE & combos
  too (Though small but it would be kinda cheap if it had big ones, isn't
  it).

* d/f+1+2 is a PERFECT HIGH CRUSH & even stops EWGFs. Damnit...lol

* Craig's known mainly for his unique VTS tackle and its the only move 
  which the players varying from scrubs to masters rely upon so keep
  using it untill you understand the timing for it. Believe me, you
  have nothing to lose if its used correctly.

* Have a look upon these things:
  CH d,d/f+4
  CH WS+4
  SLD d+2
  u/f+4
  f+3+4
 (f+2 Whiff), 1
  1+3 airthrow etc.
  What's common in all these stuns? They knock the opponent down &
  open up a opportunity for small combos but what you're overlooking is
  the groundthrow attempt you get for free after them. The best time to
  use it--> When you're running low on health & time, my advice, just go
  for it. You're going to lose anyway so this chance is worth taking.
  If you get lucky, the damage you're going to deliver is atleast close
  to 70 & thats not a bullshitt.

* If opponent is in FCD (Face down, feet towards) or PLD (Face up, feet
  away) & tries to roll away, just 3+4, 1+2. Its guaranteed & no escape.
  Easiest option if you're doubtful about anything else.

* Craig's *Magic*4 & 1+2 are both 13 frames but are meant for different
  ranges. 1+2 should be used from close to mid range as its bad on 
  whiff whereas 4 is best suited for mid to long range. Its relatievely
  safe on whiff from long range but horrible if ducked from close range.
  So check the distance you are using them from.
 
* d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, 1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2 is a staple from various groundthrows
  Does 55 damage damage itself but if you can't time the d/f+3 right the
  1 might whiff. So if you find it hard to land you can try anyone of the
  following. They are much easy comparatievely so that you still getting
  some damage from the air toss:-
  F,2, d/f+3,1,2,VTSc, f,f+1+2: 51
  U/F,4, 1, f+2,1             : 42
  2, d/f+3,1, f+2,1           : 42
  d/f+3, d+1                  : 43

* f,f+1+2 throw is escaped a lot so try not using it to beat their
  standing guard rather catching them of their attacks or motions. This
  way it'll be least escaped.

* Say you did a f,f+2. They ate it but are not doing some quick wakeup
  strategies.i.e., they aren't quickrolling, backrolling etc. You didn't
  knew that & you throwed a f+3+4 & it whiffed. They thought they got a
  chance & tried to do wakeup kicks which could be
>> A low which should be parried.
>> A mid which shouldn't be reversed.WHAT? shouldn't be reversed?
   Yes, just block it & go for the d/f+1. Even it launches at max range
   you can still combo them nicely with: 
   d/f+1, 1,2,3+4~3+4, 1,2,3+4~3+4, f,f+1+2. Still good damage. Better
   than the damage you're going to get from the reversal.

* If you & your foe are running low on health & time, never try to finish
  a match with a d+4. Try using d/f+3,1_u/f+4_WS+4 etc which are safe.

* Let me say it for a last time...Learn to PUNISH your opponent's blocked
  moves.

* If the above stuff didn't help you much, check out the various casual
  vids of good players on youtube. Though you'll be seeing DR vids for
  the most time but still they'll give you idea. 

* Enjoy playing with Craig, the most important part =)
