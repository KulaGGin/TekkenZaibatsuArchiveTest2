of each fighter.  When Tekken 4 has been released, I decided to take the
time to put together a list of all of the moves that I have noticed that
somehow evaded the command lists.  After I put a lot of work and time in
finding the hidden moves in Tekken 4, I decided to go back to Tekken Tag
Tournament and put together a FAQ of all of its hidden moves.  After that,
I put together a list for Soul Calibur 2.  And now it's time for Tekken 5!

This FAQ only covers the moves that are missing in the PS2 Tekken 5
(U.S. Version) command lists.  These moves should work on the Arcade and
other PS2 Versions of Tekken 5, but I only tested these moves on the U.S.
Version.

Because Tekken has so many moves that can be linked together, not all
the commands for these moves were included in the move lists.  Listed
in here are moves and button combinations not found specifically in any
of the move lists within the Tekken 5 PS2 game.  Also included are
commands that have unique properties.

This Hidden Moves FAQ is a list of all of the moves that can't be found
in the Tekken5 movelists.  Some of them are just basic moves or should
already be know by veterans, a few are ways that can add more damage to
existing moves, and some are really cool or helpful moves.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The purpose of this FAQ is to try to inform the Tekken 5 players of the
commands that are available to them, aside from what they have been
provided with in the in-game move lists.  These moves were obtained
various ways: experimenting with button combinations while in practice
mode, watching and trying to perform the same moves used by the computer,
and some just by chance.  A few of the moves were obtained with the help
of "Catlord's Moves List" (which can be found at www.gamefaqs.com),
Tekken Zaibatsu's Movelists (www.tekkenzaibatsu.com), and some Tekken
fans (please view the "Special Thanks" section).

I have done a little bit of research, and I've found that there are some
moves in this FAQ that cannot be found in any other Tekken 5 Movelist
currently available.  With that said, I hope you find this FAQ useful
in some way.

If you happen to see any move(s) listed in this FAQ that are actually
listed in the command lists within the U.S. version of the Tekken 5 PS2
game, please e-mail me and tell me the name of the move and its command
list number.

An example is Lei Wulong's Play Dead: number 027 / 119, which means
command #27 out of 119 total.  The number I need would be just #27.

You will receive credit for noticing commands like this whenever I
create the next version of this FAQ.  You will also receive credit for
noticing any typos or any other mistakes with the commands.  Thank you
in advance.

IMPORTANT: When sending an e-mail, please put something about "Tekken"
or "FAQ" somewhere in the e-mail topic, or the e-mail will be deleted.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1)  + -> and

    Christie Monteiro
      Rasteila to Handstand
           d/b+3, B

      Press "d/b" and "3" at the same exact time.


2)  [ ] -> Optional command
   
    Bryan Fury
      Vulcan Cannon Body Blow
          D/F#+1, 1, [1], [1], 2

      This move can be expanded into these moves...
         Vulcan Cannon Body Blow 1
              D/F#+1, 1, 2
         Vulcan Cannon Body Blow 2
              D/F#+1, 1, 1, 2
         Vulcan Cannon Body Blow 3
              D/F#+1, 1, 1, 1, 2


3)  ( _ ) -> or

    Steve Fox
      Left Right Left to Swaying
           1, 2, 1, b+(3 _ 4)

      This move can be performed by doing:
         1, 2, 1, b+3
      or by doing...
         1, 2, 1, b+4
      Only one of these commands is needed.


4)  "Dragon Fake Step to Dragon Sign Stance" Explanation

    Marshall Law
      Dragon Fake Step to Dragon Sign Stance
           DCT ~ b, f, f

    Explanation: Performing a move that can be transitioned into DFS by
    pressing "b,f" afterwards can be transitioned into DSS by pressing
    "b,f,f" instead.

    An example can be shown with the Junkyard Kick:
    In this example, "b+2,3,4" is the DCT move.
    Junkyard Kick to Dragon Fake Step
         b+2, 3, 4 ~ b, f
    Junkyard Kick to Dragon Sign Stance
         b+2, 3, 4 ~ b, f, f


5)  "Dragon Sign Stance Transition" (DSST) Explanation

    Explanation: Performing a move that can be transitioned into DSS by
    pressing "b,f" afterwards, such as 1,2~b,f.


6)  "Indian Stance Motion Taunt" (Explanation)
    Yoshimitsu
      Indian Stance Motion Taunt
           INS, 3+4#, (1 _ 2 _ 1+2), (u _ d _ f _ b)
    While in Yoshimitsu's Indian stance, hold down "3+4".  While
    still holding these buttons, press "1" or "2".  Then while you are
    still holding down "3+4", press any directional D-PAD button.
    You will hear Yoshimitsu's taunt whenever you press any D-PAD
    button.
   
    NOTE1: During this entire hidden move, you will be holding down the
           "3+4" buttons.

    NOTE2: Pressing the "1", "2", or "1+2" buttons will give you three
           different taunts.


7)  AOP,BT (Explanation)

    Ling Xiaoyu
      Reverse Phoenix Mistrust
           AOP, BT, 4

    "AOP,BT" means that you are in the AOP stance with your back
    towards your enemy.  This can occur when you are in "AOP"
    and the opponent jumps over you or sidesteps around you.


8)  Crouched Step Combo (Explanation)
      FC, d/f, d, d/f, N, f+(Any button preceded by f,f)

    For example, Lee has the following "Crouched Step Combo" moves:
    Crouched Step to Pulse Blast
         FC, d/f, d, d/f, N, f+3
    Crouched Step to Deadly Edge
         FC, d/f, d, d/f, N, f+4

    However, this move doesn't seem to work with Lee's f,f+3+4 grab.


9)  Snakeshot Rolling Dash Punch Combo (Explanation)
      SS+1, F, 1, (Any move preceded by d/f+1)

    For example, Nina has the following moves:
    Snakeshot Rolling Dash to 10-Hit Combo 2
         SS+1, F, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4
    Snakeshot Rolling Dash to Double Explosion 3
         SS+1, F, 1, 2, F+1+2
    Snakeshot Rolling Dash to Spider Knee Combo
         SS+1, F, 1, 2, 3

10) Soul Omen (Explanation)

    Jin Kazama - Soul Omen
         b+1+2#, d, u, b, f

    "Soul Omen" is performed from Jin's "Power Stance" (b+1+2).
    During the execution of the move you will hold "1+2" until you see Jin
    perform "Mental Alertness" (Check out Jin's in-game move list to see
    what it looks like).  You are able to input the "d,u,b,f" part quickly
    or at normal speed.  The most important part is to make sure that you
    are still holding "1+2".

    Right after you execute Jin's soul omen, you have a window of 5
    seconds to perform any Soul Omen with the letters "SOM" in front of it
    (See "Hidden Moves" section).

This section is dedicated to moves that can only be performed under
specific circumstances with specific fighters.

NOTE: Since Roger Jr.'s mother does the fighting, I will treat the name
      Roger Jr. as a female fighter.


Headbutt Carnival Counter
Heihachi - Panda and all male fighters except Eddy and Ganryu
When Heihachi does his "Headbutt Carnival" (f,f+1+4) against any of
the fighters listed above, the opponent can press "1" or "2" to
counter with another headbutt.
NOTE: "1" or "2" must be pressed at the exact moment that the headbutt
      connects.


Headbutt Carnival Counter Counter
Panda and all male fighters except Eddy and Ganryu - Heihachi
After one of the above fighters on the counter Heihachi's "Headbutt
Carnival", then Heihachi can then press "1" or "2" to counter with
another headbutt.  The counters can go on forever, or until someone
dies.
NOTE: "1" or "2" must be pressed at the exact moment that the headbutt
      connects.


Mach Breakable
Steve - Bryan
When Steve throws a left punch at Bryan Fury, and Bryan parries the
left punch and does his "Parry to Mach Breaker"
(b+1+2 {Parry Left Punch}, 2), then Steve can hold "B"
to go right into his sway to avoid the mach breaker.  Steve can also
counter attack the punch by pressing "2" during the sway.


Slap Happy
Nina or Anna - Eddy and all female fighters except Roger Jr. and Panda
When Nina or Anna performs their "Slap" (b+2), or "Double Slap" (b+2,2)
against one the players listed above, then the opponent can counter
with their own slap by pressing 2, or 2,2.
NOTE: The person must be hit by the slap in order for the counter
      to work.


Slap Happy Counter
Eddy and all female fighters except Roger Jr. and Panda - Nina or Anna
Nina or Anna can also counter the countered slap with another slap by
pressing 2, or 2,2.  The counters can go on forever, or until
someone dies.
NOTE: The person must be hit by the slap in order for the counter
      to work.


Short Circuit
Devil Jin - Jack-5
Devil Jin's "Hellfire Blast" (1+2) does not knock down Jack-5 like
other fighters, he only gets stunned.  Jack-5 can press "1+2" while
being hit to regain 20 points of health, which makes the total damage
17 instead of 37.

This is a list of moves that can be only done after some kind of power
charge, like the Ki Charge (1+2+3+4), which temporarily increases your
fighter's attack power.

Most of these moves are provided by Tekken Zaibatsu.

 after Raven's voice changes.)

=======================================
     Yoshimitsu
=======================================

Poison Knee Taunt
(Only when the opponent is Bryan Fury, Yoshimistu will perform Bryan's
 Knee Taunt while also spewing out poison mist.)
     {Against Bryan} 1+2+3+4 ~ b ~ f ~ u ~ d+3+4

This section gives you various bits of information that you may find
interesting or useful.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
               Steve's Blockable Unblockable
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* Info provided by Drake the Demon

Steve's "Hellfire" unblockable (qcb,f+2) can actually be blocked or
auto-guarded.  In this case, damage will be reduced to 45 (from 70)
and the victim won't get knocked away, but will crumple fall, like
after Heihachi's "1+2" (opponent slowly falls to FUFT position).
However, if you are hit by the tip of Steve's glove, you will fully
block the attack and will not receive any damage.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Delayed Attacks
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Some moves can be delayed by pausing between button presses.
Some examples are Jin's "Evil Intent" (b,f+2<1<2) and Lei's
"Razor Rush Mid Kick" (f,N+1<2<1<2<4).



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Command Grabs
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Performing command grabs (grabs other then 1+3 or 2+4) on the side
or back will perform the grab as if you pressed 1+3 or 2+4.

An example can be seen with Christie:
Air Mail (ALT)
     {Approach from Behind} d/f+1+2



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                Asuka's Leg Cutter Infinite
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Asuka can perform an infinite attack from her Leg Cutter move.
There are different variations of this infinite, but here is one:
d/b+4,[4,4],(1+4,2,1,4,[4,4])......



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                Blocking the Frankensteiner
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Even though King and Roger Jr's "Frankensteiner" (d/f+3+4) is a special
mid attack, it cannot be blocked by holding BACK on the controller.
It's a special case that must be blocked as if it was a low attack.
So, the only way to really block the move is to do a crouching
block (D/B).



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Jin's Power Stance
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Jin's "Power Stance" (b+1+2) has the ability to make Jin's attacks count
as a counter hit for a short period of time, but it also serves as an
auto-counter attack.  If Jin is hit by the opponent while performing
the Power Stance, the opponent will receive a percentage of damage
based on their attack.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                Steve's Flicker Stance(s)?
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Steve's "Flicker Stance" has two different properties.  His normal
Flicker Stance is "1+2" and the other one is done by pressing back
after certain moves, such as "f+2,1~b".  The difference is that there
are some moves that can be done in the normal Flicker Stance that
can't be done in the second Flicker Stance, and vise versa.

One example is:
FLK1,f+2 = Ducking Body Blow
FLK2,f+2 = British Lancer

Another example is:
FLK1,b+3 = Ducking Left
FLK2,b+3 = Swaying

Steve's Sway Techniques can done by both FLK1 and FLK2, but the
"b+3" or "b+4" Sway can only be done during FLK2.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Flicker Stance Cancel
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* Info provided by Drake the Demon

Steve has the ability to cancel his Flicker Stance:

FLK,(d/f_d_d/b_f) - These inputs cancel FLK stance and also work as
a buffer.  For example: you press d/f; at this point, FLK is cancelled,
but if you quickly press 2 into the combination, you get the d/f+2
uppercut.  You can also do: d (FLK cancel),d/f,f+1 to get qcf+1,
and so on.  However, this method only works if you entered FLK with
1+2 or b+1+2.

If you initiated FLK with a transition after certain moves
(b+1~b for example), all of these cancels except the d/b version
become impossible. This means now you cannot cancel FLK into a
qcf+1, but you can cancel it to a simple d/b+3 or d/b+2.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                      I Have the Power!
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Some fighters have another way of powering up other than doing
the "Ki Power Charge" (1+2+3+4).  The moves are:

Heihachi Mishima - Heaven's Wrath - b+(1+3 _ 2+4)

Jin Kazama - Power Stance - b+1+2
           - Lingering Soul Transitions (See Hidden Moves section)
           - Soul Omen (b+1+2#,d,u,b,f)

Paul Phoenix - Incomplete Somersault Crouch - D# {Hold for 1 second}

Raven - Summon Force - d+1+2



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Heihachi's Heaven's Wrath
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Heihachi's "Heaven's Wrath", b+(1+3 _ 2+4), is a counter against
most mid/high attacks.  This counter seems to be useless due to the
fact that it inflicts more damage on Heihachi than the opponent
(inflicts 15 damage on opponent and 50 on Heihachi).

However, there are some attacks that will inflict more than
15 damage to the opponent when they are reversed.  For example:
Yoshimitsu's "Kamikaze" (f+3+4) = 40 damage
Craig's "Double Leg Takedown" (VTS,1+2) = 25 damage

Reversing Yoshimitsu's sword has a few different properties.
Heihachi will receive less damage than before (usually 15), and he
will reverse with a different animation.

Some of Yoshimitsu's sword attacks that Heihachi can parry are:
Wood Cutter (d/f+3,1)
Quick Slash (d+1)
Sword Stab (b,b+1)
Sword Poke Windmill (b,b+1,N+1)
Face Splitter (b,b+1,1+2)
Thunder Blade (b,b+1+2)
Death Copter (u/f+1+2)
Moonsault Slayer (qcf+1)

Countering "Yoshimitsu's Suicide" (f,F+1+4), "Double Suicide" (f,F+1+4,f,F),
or "Meditation Harakiri" (MED,1+4) inflicts 70 damage to Heihachi and only
20 damage to Yoshimitsu.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Baek's Flamingo Stance
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Aside from his normal Flamingo stance attacks, Baek can perform some
of his normal attacks from his Flamingo stance.  From the Flamingo
stance, Some attacks will be at a slightly faster speed than normal.
You can notice the speed difference when you see it.

For example, he can do:
FLA,d/b+4
FLA,d+4,3,3,3



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     While Rising Moves
-------------------------------------------------------------------


There are many moves within the game that when performed, causes your
fighter to enter a crouched position.  If you leave the controller
neutral, you can perform any "WS" move.  There are also a few moves
that also has this property if you block or are hit by your opponent's
attack.  This also applies to the "Crouch Dash" (f,N,d,d/f) and the
"Slither Step" (qcf,N).

An example can be seen with Bryan:
Snake Edge to While Rising
     d/f+3; WS (Any WS Move)

Being hit with Steve's "Wildman" (WS+1,2) forces you to crouch.

Being hit by or blocking Marduk's "Dunk Elbow" (d+1) also forces you
to crouch.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
             While Crouching / While Rising Moves
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Since you are technically crouching at the start of "WS", some "FC"
attacks can be done while in "WS".

For example, the following moves can be performed:

Anna - Rising Cat Thrust
     WS, f+1

Anna - Rising Right Hand Stab
     WS, f+2

Ling - Rising Fire Dancer
     WS, d+3, 2, 1, 4



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Who's The Chicken Now?
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* Info provided by Drake the Demon

"Chicken" is when you reverse a reversal.  Depending on which
attack was reversed, the input for "Chicken" is as follows:

Chicken (Left)
     RevL f+1+3

Chicken (Right)
     RevR f+2+4

However, not all attacks can be chickened.  Here are a few of the
attacks that cannot be chickened:

- Anna's Attack reversal on Devil Jin's TGF cannot be chickened.
  This does not apply for anyone else.
- King and Roger cannot chicken out of a reversed Frankensteiner (d/f+3+4).
- None of Wang's left punch reversals can be chickened.

And, the chicken command for double punch input attacks (ex. f+1+2, etc.)
is always dependant on the animation.  If the character uses their left
arm/leg, the command is f+1+3.  Right arm/leg is f+2+4 for chicken.

There are tons of unchickenable moves in the game.  Just look at the
"TTT Chickening Chart" in the "TTT Game System" section.  Most of this
info applies for Tekken 5 (but replace Jun with Asuka and Jin with Devil Jin).
http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/tekkentag/system_chickenchart.php



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Throw Bug
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* Info provided by Drake the Demon

During certain throws (ex. Wang's "d/f+1+3+4" and Julia's "d+1+3" on
a crouching opponent), you can keep mashing "START" and get totally
weird damages (set Attack Data to Type 2).  For me, Julia's "d+1+3"
did 60 or 42 damage.  Wang's "d/f+1+3+4" did 27 instead of 40+.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
              Yoshimitsu's Ultimate Death Slash
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Yoshimitsu can charge his "Death Slash" attack to deal more damage
to the opponent.  Every hop that Yoshimitsu takes during this attack
increases the amount of damage that a connected hit deals to the
opponent.

A normal "Quick Slash" (d+1) does only 10 damage.
A "Death Slash" (d+1,D/B) can be charged to deal 15, 23, 27, 43, 65,
or 107 damage.  The maximum damage is reached when Yoshimitsu's sword
smokes and a purple spark comes from the sword.  After the spark, the
damage is reset to 15 damage, then the cycle repeats itself.  Release
"D/B" when you are ready to attack.

The "Ultimate Death Slash" can also be done from the "Poison Wind Gold Fist"
(u/f+3+4, b+1, 4, D/B+1).

In Ultra-Hard and Arcade modes, the computer will stay in place and try
to duck the "Ultimate Death Slash" most of the time (which isn't possible).
So, this guarantees 107 damage.  However, it's dangerous to try this against
human opponents.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Hard Hit Recovery
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* Thanks to NeoRussell and Drake the Demon

If you are hit by an attack that causes you to roll backwards, then
you can press "D/B" to do a skidding recovery roll.  However, this
may not be possible when getting hit by an unblockable.

Some of the attacks that cause you to roll back are:
Bruce - {CH} f,f+3
Bryan - f,f+3
Ling - {CH} d/b+1
Paul -  qcf+2
Yoshimitsu - {CH} f+1+2

You can also perform a Spring Up recovery after heavy knockdowns, such
as Feng Wei's "{CH} b+1" or Heihachi's "2,2,1".  It is the only possible
tech get up after these moves.  You can also "Hop Up" by pressing "f"
after certain knockdowns, like Paul's "qcf+1".



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Kazuya's Just Frames
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* Info provided by Drake the Demon

There are two versions of Kazuya's "f,N,d,d/f+4:1" and "f,N,d,d/f+4:4"
just frames.  Which version comes out depends on the distance from your
opponent.  The versions are:

a. If you do them from close range, the first sweep will trip the
   opponent, but the second hit (the punch or another sweep) will
   connect as a juggle hit and the overall damage is increased by 3
   points for both moves.

b. If you do them from far out, the first hit will cause the opponent
   to fall to one knee (kneel stun) and the second hit will knock them
   down.  In this version, "f,N,d,d/f+4:1" does 37 damage and
   "f,N,d,d/f+4:4" does 24 damage and also allows you to juggle after
   the second sweep.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Instant While Standing (iWS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* Some info provided by Drake the Demon

Normally, WS moves can be executed using the following methods:
1. You crouch down with (D _ D/F _ D/B), then release the button
   and when you are about to get back into standing position, you
   input (1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 1+2 _ 3+4) for the WS move.
2. You use (u/f _ u _ u/b) to jump and input (1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 1+2 _ 3+4)
   for WS moves AFTER you have landed.

However, there's a quicker way to do WS moves. You need to input
d,(d/f_d/b),N+(any WS input). To make this easier, you can also do
(qcf_qcb)+(any WS input), but only with certain characters, since
many of them have regular qcf+(1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 1+2 _ 3+4) moves.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Crouch Cancel (CC)
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* Info provided by Drake the Demon

After some moves, your character recovers in crouching (FC) position.
A good example is Lee's "HMS+4".  Since the sweep floats the opponent,
Lee will want to use some juggles, but he's in FC, so he cannot really
do any damaging moves to follow up...  Unless he quickly cancels the
crouch and does normal moves.  To do that, he needs to press "u" right
after the sweep animation is over. For example, he can do:
HMS+4; CC; d/f+1; 1,2~f,N; 1,2~f,N {WALL}; 4,3,4 for insane damage.

Few more things to know about CC:
- You can also use f,f to cancel crouch (maybe even b,b, but I'm unsure)
- On paper, a CC takes 1 frame. but in reality, probably no one is able
  to do CC that fast.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Recover Crouching
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* Info provided by Drake the Demon

There are a lot of moves that fighters can recover crouching from
if you hold "D" after execution. Here's a list of a few of the possible
moves:

NOTE: Different moves will be separated by semicolons ";"


Anna - d/b+1; FC,d/f+2; FC,(u/f_u_u/b)+4; FC,(U/F_U_U/B)+4;
       (U/F_U_U/B)+4

Asuka - Leg Cutters (d/b+4; b+2,4; b+3,4; 1,4; d/b+4,4; d/b+4,4,4);
        all Thunderfall kicks (3+4 and also any 3 input after Leg Cutter)
        but only if the opponent isn't grounded; (WS_FC,b)+3; (WS_FC)+3+4;
        (WS_FC)+3+4,3+4

Christie/Eddy - u/f+1+2; FC+1+2 (and also all Crying Needle inputs in
                his/her movelist); f+2,1,4; SS+4; HSP,2,4

Ganryu - u/f+1+2; all Splits inputs (SIT,d) and Recliner inputs (SIT,F_B)

Heihachi - d+1

Hwoarang - LFF,4,4,4,3

Jack-5 - Recliner (All rolls from SIT)

Kuma/Panda - FC,d/f+1+2; All rolls (including from SIT and FDFA position)

Lee - FC,u/f+3; u/f+3+4; HMS,u/f+3; FC,(U_U/F_U/B)+4

Lei - FUFT,3+4; JF Quick Rolls

Ling - (u_u/f)+4; f,f+4(blocked),4; RDS,f,f+3+4

Marshall - 1,2,u/f+3; f+1+2; (U/F_U_U/B)+3

Paul - d+1; WS+2

Raven - qcf+1+2; f+3+4,3+4

Steve - 1,2,1,d+2; {CH} f+1:2,1,d+2; b+1,2; 2,1,d+2; d/b+2



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Oops!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------


You will hear the announcer say "Oops" when Kuma connects the "Fatal Wind"
(b,b+2+3+4), or if Yoshimitsu does his "Kamikaze Feint" (f+3+4~b).



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Heihachi's Revenge
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Heihachi's "Raijin's Wrath" ("d+3+4,2" or "d+3+4,2 fully charged") does 5
points extra damage against Devil Jin, Jin, Kazuya, Lee, and Jinpachi.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                Blocking Jinpachi's Super Stun
-------------------------------------------------------------------


While playing around in practice mode, using an Action Replay MAX to
use Jinpachi, I found a way to block Jinpachi's "Super Stun" (b+1+2).
You can do this by pressing either (d/b _ d _ d/f _ FC,d/f _ FC,D _ FC,d/b)
right when he does his stun.  Basically, you have to try to enter the FC
position, or already be in that position.  Your player will shrug off the
effects of the stun.  Blocking the stun does seem to require exact timing,
except when you're already in the full crouch position.  However, I don't
know if there is a way to block after you have been stunned.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Figure Four Leglock Reversal
-------------------------------------------------------------------


When King performs his "Figure Four Leglock Reversal" (d/b+1+2), you can
reverse it by pressing 3+4 at the exact moment that your player is damaged
from the attack.  Turn on the "hit analysis" in practice mode and you will
see your player flash, which indicates when the input is required.  You
will still receive damage, but King will receive 26 points of damage.

                  Bryan's Psychotic Laughter
-------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a list of moves that will make Bryan laugh at the opponent
when he is hit by them.


Anna/Nina - Bryan
Bryan's Twisted Mind
When Anna or Nina connect the "Twisted Mind" (d+3+4) on a grounded Bryan
Fury, Bryan will laugh back at them. Also, Bryan will regain 1 point of
health, which makes the damage 15 instead of 16.


Asuka - Bryan
Furious Heart Stopper
When Asuka's "Heart Stopper" attack connects on a counter hit ({CH} b+4)
against Bryan Fury, Bryan will laugh back at Asuka. Also, Bryan will
regain 1 point of health, which makes the damage 20 instead of 21.


Asuka - Bryan
Power Ultimate Punches
When Asuka's "Power Ultimate Punches" (check below) connects against
Bryan Fury, Bryan will laugh back at Asuka during the tackle.
Power Ultimate Punches = 1+2+3+4 ~ D/F#+3+4, 3+4, 1+2, (2,1,2,1 _ 2,1,1,2)


Jack-5 - Bryan
Furious Volcano Blaster
When Jack-5 performs the Volcano Blaster (d/f,D/F+2+4) on Bryan Fury,
Jack-5 will laugh then Bryan will laugh, letting you know that you are
performing the "Volcano Blaster" and not the "Volcano" (d/f+2+4), which
has a longer recovery time.


Kuma/Panda - Bryan
Furious Rock 'n Roll Circus
When Kuma performs the "Rock 'n Roll Circus" (hcb,F+1+2) on Bryan Fury,
Bryan will laugh back at Kuma/Panda.


Lee - Bryan
Lee Furious Harassment
When Lee performs his "Lee Harassment" side throw on Bryan Fury by
pressing "2+4" instead of "1+3", Bryan will laugh back at Lee. Also,
Bryan will regain 5 points of health, which makes the damage 35 instead
of 40.


Nina - Bryan
Bryan's Bad Habit
When Nina's "Bad Habit" attack connects on a counter hit ({CH} f,f+3)
against Bryan Fury, Bryan will laugh back at Nina.


NOTE: In order to see Bryan regain energy in "Practice Mode", you will
      have to set the "Attack Data" to "Type 2", then look at Bryan's
      total damage after performing the move.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Multi-Throw Button Mashing
-------------------------------------------------------------------


If you're having problems executing multi-throws, there are several
multi-throws that you can execute by just mashing buttons.  I have
provided a list of multi-throws that can be executed by repeatedly
pressing (mashing) the "1+2+3+4" buttons after the starting grab.

You will have to mash the "1+2+3+4" buttons until the move is executed.

WARNING: Make sure you do this with your own controller, or with
         someone who won't get mad if you mash buttons on their
         controller.

It seems that you get better results when mapping the buttons to
the shoulder buttons.  I like to use the following configuration:
L2 = LP+RP (1+2) or LP+LK (1+3)
L1 = LK+RK (3+4) or RP+RK (2+4)
R2 = LP+RK (1+4)
R1 = RP+LK (2+3)
With this configuration, you can use R1+R2 to button mash.
Choose a configuration that works well for you.

                   Throw and Tackle Escapes
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Most throws can be escaped by pressing "1", "2", or "1+2" while you
are in the process of being grabbed.

"1+3" grab is escaped by pressing "1"
"2+4" grab is escaped by pressing "2"

If you want to know which button to press for all of the other grabs,
check out the "Tekken 5 Move Lists", created by Drake the Demon,
on the Tekkenomics Blog below:
http://tekkenomics.wordpress.com/t5-move-lists/


One special escape is:
Paul can reverse the first RIGHT ultimate punch during a tackle.
Just input "1,1,2" or "1+2,1+2,1+2" (can be buffered) instead of the
normal escape command.


Some of the other tackle escapes are:

Tackle Break
(Press when being grabbed by opponent.)
     1+2

Tackle Reversal
(Input right before your back hits the ground.)
     1+2

Arm Breaker Escape
     1+2, 2, 2, 2, 2

Leg Breaker Escape
Any Fighter
     1+2, 1, 1, 1, 1


If all else fails, just repeatedly press the "1+2" buttons.

                                         [the second hit forces
                                          opponent to crouch on hit])
 -> d/f+3,3 - Infinite Kick Starter 1  (dmg: 10,10; hit range: m,h)
 -> d+3,3,3 - Infinite Kick Starter 2  (dmg: 8,10,10; hit range: l,m,h)
-------------------------------------

                                         [forces opponent to
                                          crouch on hit])
d+3 - Low Kick                         (dmg: 10 (8 if done in sequence AFTER

                  Baek's Flamingo Cancel
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* This section is written by Drake the Demon


Baek can cancel the FLA into most of his special moves. For attacks
that contain a left punch, right punch, double punch or right kick
input, you only need to press the normal combination (for example
FLA->f+1+2,4). Now for double kick or left kick attacks, the method
is tricky. First, when you are entering FLA, you must keep 3 held down
(for example press b+3 or 1,2,3~f and keep 3 held down afterwards).
Then, if you want to execute the attack, you must input it with 4:

Left kick attacks:
- Keep 3 held down -> RELEASE 3 and input the command with 4.

Examples:
1. You want to do d/f+3,4 from FLA -> release 3 and press d/f+4,4
2. for d+3,3,N+3 -> release 3 and press d+4,3,N+3
3. for 3,3,3,4 -> release 3 and press 4,3,3,4

Double kick attacks:
- Keep 3 held down -> input the command with 4.

Examples:
1. You want to do d/b+3+4 from FLA -> hold 3 and press d/b+4
2. For u/f+3+4 -> hold 3 and press u/f+4


Now, a list of special moves Baek CAN'T DO from FLA (with the above methods):

Throws (except f+2~3)
All WS, FC, WR moves (this is obvious, you cannot run or crouch in FLA)
SS+1
b,b+2
u/f+2
f,N,d,d/f+3
f+3,3,2
f,f,N+3
f,f+3
d/b+3
u/f,N+3 (and all follow ups)
f+4,3
f+4,4
f,f+4
u/f+4
u+4,3
wall jump
b,b+3+4 unblockable

            King's Multi-Throws using Shoulder Buttons
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* This section is written by Cypher195


Legend
------
R1=3+4
R2=1+2
L1=1+4

Any buttons written between / /  means you press the next button without
releasing the first, just a "trick" to perform some of King's throws
easily, e.g.: /2,1,3/ means press 2, then 1 without releasing 2, then 3
without releasing either of 2 & 1.

Here we go:
R1,L1
1,4,2,3
/2,1,3/
R2,1, /2,L1/
2,2,R2
R1, /R2,4/
1,2,R1,R2
3,1,2, /R1,R2/   or   2,1,3,4

More infomration available within the "Devil Within FAQ" by CJ800:
http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/920588/35670


Gaining Ranks Quickly
---------------------
In order to gain ranks quickly you must fight against opponents that are
near your current rank.  After each match in Arcade Mode, you can choose
which ranking to fight against. You should always try to choose a ranking
that is within two rankings higher or lower than you.  For example, a 3rd
Dan will want to fight against one of the following:
1st Dan, 2nd Dan, 3rd Dan, 4th Dan, or 5th Dan.  If there are no available
fighters within this interval, choose "Exit" and re-enter Arcade Mode.



=============================
            Other
=============================


Noise Pollution
---------------
If you hold the down button the on the controller before the match
begins, then you will be able to hear Mokujin wood chop sounds whenever
he is hit or when he blocks.
NOTE: The sound effect ends as soon as the match is over.


In-Game Reset
-------------
Press "start" and "select" simultaneously to return to the Menu
screen at any time, except while in the Options menu.


Exit from Arcade History
------------------------
To exit a game in "Arcade History", you will have to hold "Start" and
then press "Select" until you exit.


Command Continuous Playback
---------------------------
In practice mode, you can have a move repeated continuously by first
recording it with the command capture, then by playing it with
"SELECT + SQUARE" buttons.


Hidden Story Mode Cut-Scenes
----------------------------
In Story Mode, you play certain matches that are important to a
character's story.  If you lose this match, you will get to see a
short hidden cut-scene.  However, not all fighter's have this special
cut-scene. The special cut-scenes occur when: Anna loses to Lee,
Yoshimitsu loses to Raven, and Marshall loses to Paul.


Special Time Attack Mode Cut-Scene
----------------------------------
In Time Attack Mode, you will see a special cut-scene if you fight
against Heihachi Mishima on the 7th stage.


Fashion Show
------------
In Customize Mode, you can zoom in by pressing "R1" and zoom out by
pressing "L1".  Pressing both "R2" and "L2" resets the position of the
fighter back to the default position.  Moving the right analog stick
rotates the fighter.  And pressing the select button removes all of
the menus so that you can get a better view of your fighter.


Difficulty Level Bug
--------------------
On the NTSC version of Tekken 5 (maybe all versions), it seems that
if you go directly to "Practice Mode" before doing anything else, the
Difficulty Level of the game will change to "Easy".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I've received some questions about this FAQ through e-mail, so I
decided to create a section where I will give my reply to those
questions.



----------
Question 1 - Jin's Soul Omen
----------

Q:  I can actually perform Jin's soul omen which is "b+1+2#,d,u,b,f"
    and two of the SOM moves: Soul Rage Right Roundhouse Punch and              
    Soul Rage Lunging Low Roundhouse.  But I just couldn't perform
    the other moves although I've tried them so many times and I'm
    sure I follow the exact combo.  I saw other people performed the
    moves though...why is it so?  I mean can you tell me the exact way
    and tips of doing the rest of SOM moves?

A:  First, right after you execute Jin's soul omen "b+1+2#,d,u,b,f",
    you have a window of about 5 seconds to perform any Soul Omen with
    the letters "SOM" in front of it in this FAQ.  And as far as I can
    tell, you can perform any move that doesn't have a "SOM" in front of
    it and still be able to do any "SOM" move within the 5 seconds.

    Now, here are some tips on the "SOM" moves:

    Soul Rage 5 Hit Stinger Combo
         SOM, 1, 2, 3, 1, f+3 ~ 3
    Soul Rage 6 Hit Combo
         SOM, 1, 2, 3, 1, f+3 ~ 3, 3
    Soul Rage 6 Hit Combo to Lingering Soul
         SOM, 1, 2, 3, 1, f+3 ~ 3, 3 {HIT*}, d+1+2
    For these moves, I found it a little difficult to do myself.
    The way that I found that helps a lot is to HOLD down the "F"
    button when you get to it and just keep on holding it until the
    combo is over.

    Soul Rage 8 Hit Combo
         SOM, 1, 2, 3 * 1, 3, 2, 1, 4
    Soul Rage 8 Hit Combo to Lingering Soul
         SOM, 1, 2, 3 * 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, d+1+2
    For the last two moves, I found it helpful if you add a little
    pause between the "1,2,3" and the rest of the combo.  Also, for
    the last combo "Soul Rage 8 Hit Combo to Lingering Soul", it isn't
    necessary to hit the opponent on the last hit to do the "d+1+2"
    part (like some of the other moves that do require a hit).  Just
    do it right after the last 4 and you should be able to do it.



----------
Question 2 - While Rising
----------

Q:  I'm having trouble with the move Jasmine Blossom with the player
    Ling Xiaoyu.  Can you please explain the move in detail as I'm not
    sure on what "while rising" means.

A:  I believe that the move that you are referring to is the:
    Jasmine Blossom Wakeup Call
         WS+2# ~ f

    I will explain the "while rising" part.
    "While rising" is meant to explain the moment when a fighter is in
    the progress of returning to their default fighting position from
    the crouching position, or a move that ends in them crouching.

    You can get to the crouching position by pressing "d/b".  By leaving
    the controller neutral, you will go into "WS".

    There are a number of moves for Ling that will make her go into "WS"
    after performing the move.  Some of these are: d+2 <or> d+4 <or> 4~3.
    After one of these moves are performed, 1/2 to 1 second later, Ling
    will go into "WS".  This is when you see her on her way back to
    standing in her normal fighting stance.

    Now, for the Jasmine Blossom Wakeup Call "WS+2#~f", when you are
    in "WS" mode you want to hold down the "2" button.  Just doing this
    will perform the Jasmine Blossom.  But to do the "Jasmine Blossom
    Wakeup Call", you want to hold down the "2" button, then press the "f"
    button when see her moving her right hand.  The move will result in
    Ling going back to her normal stance instead of going to Rain Dance.



----------
Question 3 - Blocking the Frankensteiner
----------

Q:  How do you block King and Roger Jr's Frankensteiner (d/f+3+4)?
    I keep holding BACK on the controller, but it doesn't work.

A:  The Frankensteiner hits Mid, but it's a special case that must be
    blocked as if it was a low attack.  The only way to really block
    the move is to do a crouching block (D/B).



----------
Question 4 - Soul Siphon VS Soul Possession
----------

Q:  What is the difference between the "Solar Kick Soul Siphon" and
    the "Solar Kick Soul Possession" moves?

A:  For the "Solar Kick Soul Siphon", Yoshimitsu receives energy from
    his opponent and for the "Solar Kick Soul Possession", Yoshimitsu
    gives energy to his opponent.



----------
Question 5 - Yoshimitsu's BT moves
----------

Q:  Moves like "Reverse Soul Stealer" (BT,u+1+4) and "Reverse Manji
    Butterfly" (BT,u+1+2) work only if done immediately after a move that
    leads Yoshimitsu to "BT" (for example, "Solar Kick" (f,f+1+2) or
    "Ninjaflip" (BT,3)).

A:  I just tested them out, and these moves do work during a normal BT,
    but they seem to be harder to do than if the move was done after
    "f,f+1+2".  It is a lot easier if you set your shoulder buttons on
    your controller to:
    LP+RP (1+2), LK+RK (3+4), LP+LK (1+3), and RP+RK (2+4)



----------
Question 6 - Spaces
----------

Q:  Do the extra spaces between the buttons for the "Hidden Moves"
    section mean anything?

A:  There isn't any meaning for the spaces.  When I first wrote my
    "Tekken 4 Hidden Moves" FAQ, I felt that everything looked all
    crowded and bunched together, so I added spaces between each button
    press to spread things out.  If you remove all of the extra spaces
    that I added, it should still be the same move.



----------
Question 7 - Weapons in matches?
----------

Q:  "Can you use the customization items in the match?  For example,
     can Nina use her sword and Lei use his gun?"

A:  No, the custom items are just used to change the appearance of
    your fighter.  They have no affect on gameplay.



----------
Question 8 - EWGF and EWHF
----------

Q:  How do you do the EWGF with Kazuya?

A:  Kazuya's EWGF is just like doing the WGF/Rising Uppercut "f,N,d,d/f+2",
    but at a faster speed.  The input for EWGF is "f~N,d~d/f+2".
    This is the same command used for Heihachi's EWGF, Devil Jin's EWGF,
    and Jin's EWHF.

    It takes some time to get the timing down.  When I first learned it,
    I could only do it about 5% of the time.  I slowly improved over time,
    and now I can do it about 50% of the time.



----------
Question 9 - Lei's Dragon to Tiger
----------

Q:  "I can't seem to do lei's f,N+4,1,2,2~f, DGN, 1+3 into Tiger...
    it comes out as the drunken throw."

A:  Press "1+3" right after entering DGN from "f,N+4,1,2,2~f".
    There's a small window when the move can be done,
    which can be seen with "Hit Analysis" in Practice Mode.
    During this window, "1+3" into TGR is the only possible move.



-----------
Question 10 - Tekken Lord rank for everyone
-----------

Q:  "What happens once all characters reach the rank of Tekken Lord?"

A:  I have all Tekken Lords and nothing happened.



-----------
Question 11 - Frame data
-----------

Q:  "Where can I get Frame Data for Tekken 5?"

A:  Tekken Zaibatsu has updated their website with Tekken 5 frame data.
    You can find it at the following link:
    http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/tekken5/_framedata.php

The main purpose of "Tekkenomics" is to provide you with Tekken FAQs/Guides
and to keep you updated on Tekken news and information.

"Tekkenomics" was originally the name of the website created by me
(Wild Man X), with help from Paulinstein and Drake the Demon, which first
came online on November 6, 2004.  However, due to someone engaging in
piracy on our hosting server the website went down in April 2007.  With
the release of Tekken 6 approaching for consoles, I decided to bring back
Tekkenomics, but in the form of a blog back in June 2009.

"Tekkenomics" contains various Tekken related material, some of which is
difficult to find on any other Tekken based website.  The blog will
contain exclusive articles, original FAQ files, move lists, combos/juggles,
combo videos, in-game matches, Tekken commercials, PC desktop wallpaper,
PSP wallpaper, CG art, fan-based material, and other things.

If you're having problems visiting the "Tekkenomics Blog" at
http://www.tekkenomics.com, then you can also visit it at the following
link: http://tekkenomics.wordpress.com

If you were wondering how we came up with the name "Tekkenomics", back in
my high school days in the year 2000, Paulinstein, me, and some other high
school friends would get together to play Tekken 3 on the PlayStation 1.
At the time, we were also enrolled in Economics. Whenever we would get
together to play, we would say that we were going to study some
"Tekkenomics".  So, basically: "Tekken" + "Economics" = "Tekkenomics".

There are a few references on the web to the name "Tekkenomics" that
aren't related to us or our blog.  There are some members on the Tekken
Zaibatsu forums that go by the names "Tekkenomics", "Tekkenomics_101",
and "TekkenNomics Jr." that aren't related to us. On Tekken Zaibatsu,
we go by the names "Wild Man X", "Paulinstein", and "Drake the Demon".
The things on the web that ARE related to us are at: GameFAQs, Neoseeker,
IGN, 1UP.com, Gamerhelp, Gamespot, MySpace, AIM, MSN Messenger, Hotmail,
GMail, YouTube, PicasaWeb, Blogger, WordPress, ImageShack, and Twitter.

I have been a fan of the Tekken series since 2000.  A few of my friends
got me into the series with Tekken 3.

My first FAQ was "Hidden Moves" for Tekken 4.  Writing this FAQ, I've
learned some new things about Tekken along the way that I probably
wouldn't have learned otherwise.  My FAQs are a way for me to share
what I have learned.

Lei Wulong is my main fighter, and has been since Tekken 3.  When I bought
Tekken Tag Tournament for the PS2, I decided to learn how to play with all
of the fighters, and this has carried over to Tekken 4, Tekken 5, and
Tekken: Dark Resurrection.  So, you can rest assured that I do atleast
know a little bit about what I'm talking about :)

I am currently residing in Southern California (in the United States),
but have not been to any of the arcades in the area in a long time.  I
used to play at the University of California, Riverside.

I hope that you've enjoyed my FAQs!
