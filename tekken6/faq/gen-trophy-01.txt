The console release of Tekken 6 introduces trophies (and achievements) to
the Tekken franchise for the first time.  The focus of this guide is to
provide you with a list of all trophies available within the game as well
as provide you with some tips on getting every trophy available.

I only have the PS3 version on Tekken 6, so I will be using "trophy" to
refer to both trophies and achievements.

The PSP does not have a trophy system.

It took me about 20 hours and 28 minutes of play time to get my platinum
trophy, which includes time playing around in the practice mode, playing
others online and earning extra money/items.  So, if you just focus on
earning the trophies, it could possibly take you less time.

NOTE: You will need to download and install patch version 1.01 to enable
      the Online Mode.

Patch version 1.03 enables online co-op for Scenario Campaign.  Since I
already obtained all available trophies, I am unable to verify whether
some of the Scenario Campaign trophies can be obtained from this new mode.
However, this new mode is a great way to earn new customization items with
high-level attributes.

-----------------------------------------------------------
     Regular Trophies
-----------------------------------------------------------


Description                       Trophy      Gamerscore
-----------                       ------      ----------


====================================================
Give Your Fists a Rest            Bronze      15 G
====================================================

Defeat an enemy using a weapon in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: For this trophy, you just have to defeat any enemy with any weapon

====================================================

Unlock a movie in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: When you unlock the "Arena" after clearing the "Southern Woodlands"
stage in the Scenario Campaign Mode, go into the Arena, select any
available fighter, then clear all 4 stages.  You will unlock this trophy
after you watch your selected fighter's ending movie.  To speed things up,
set the number of rounds to 1 from the Options menu.



====================================================
Item Connoisseur                  Silver      30 G
====================================================

Obtain a Rank S Item in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: You will get this trophy when you pick up a treasure chest containing
an item with a ranking of "S", which is one level above "A" and is the
highest ranking available.  To help in getting an "S" rank item, you
should equip you and your partner with an item that has the "Increase
Drop Rate" property.  The higher the percentage the better, as "S" rank
items are very rare.

I obtained my first "S" rank item on the "Kigan Island" stage with a
Hard difficulty setting, and obtained several other on "Mishima
Industries, Biotech Research Station Ruins" and "Subterranean Pavilion",
also on Hard.

It is possible to obtain "S" rank items on "Nightmare Train",
"Subterranean Pavillion" and "Kigan Island" on the Medium difficulty.

From what I've seen, the treasure chest that contains the Rank "S" item
will have a white trimming.  From what I've read on the TZ forums, the
white treasure chest contains the highest ranking item for a stage and
it might not be an "S" reank item.



====================================================
Treasure Amateur                  Bronze      10 G
====================================================

Collect 50 treasures in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: Defeated enemies will randomly drop treasure chests, which you can
pick up by walking over them.  Sometimes you might also find a treasure
chest within a wooden crate.  Treasure that you pick up is still counted
if you fail a stage.  To speed things up, make sure that you always have
an item equipped with the "Increase Drop Rate" property.  You are only
allowed to have up to 5 unique properties equipped at a time, so make sure
this property is enabled.  It is okay to repeat stages after you've
cleared them.



====================================================
Treasure Enthusiast               Bronze      20 G
====================================================

Collect 100 treasures in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: Same tip as the "Treasure Amateur" trophy.



====================================================
Treasure Master                   Silver      30 G
====================================================

Collect 200 treasures in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: Same tip as the "Treasure Amateur" trophy.



====================================================
Enemy Hunting Amateur             Bronze      10 G
====================================================

Defeat 300 enemies in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: While playing through Scenario Campaign Mode, you will eventually
obtain this trophy by simply defeating the enemies you come across.  It
is okay to repeat stages after you've cleared them.  Enemies knocked into
the water will die instantly, including stage bosses.



====================================================
Enemy Hunting Enthusiast          Bronze      20 G
====================================================

Defeat 1000 enemies in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: Same tip as the "Enemy Hunting Amateur" trophy.



====================================================
Enemy Hunting Master              Silver      30 G
====================================================

Defeat 2000 enemies in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: Same tip as the "Enemy Hunting Amateur" trophy.



====================================================
Playing With Fire                 Bronze      15 G <UPDATE>
====================================================

Defeat 100 enemies with the Flamethrower in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: To obtain this trophy, you will need to pick up a Flamethrower that
you find on the ground or within a wooden crate and defeat as many enemies
as possible with it before it disappears from overuse.  It is okay to
repeat stages after you've cleared them.

The stages that I've seen that contain a Flamethrower are:
- Southern Woodlands
- Container Terminal 7
- Lost Cemetery
- Secret Underground Passage
- Central District, 11th Avenue
- Violet Systems
- G Security Service, Operations Headquarters (random)
- Azazel's Temple, Central Corridor

"Secret Underground Passage" is a good stage, because some of the very big
enemies will drop Flamethrowers after being defeated.

Flamethrower Controls:
1 (LP) or 2 (RP) = Shoot Flamethrower
3 (LK) = Pick-up / Drop weapon



====================================================
Heavy Artillery                   Bronze      15 G <UPDATE>
====================================================

Defeat 100 enemies with the Gatling Gun in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: To obtain this trophy, you will need to pick up a Gatling Gun that
you find on the ground or within a wooden crate and defeat as many enemies
as possible with it before it disappears from overuse.  It is okay to
repeat stages after you've cleared them.

The stages that I've seen that contain a Gatling Gun are:
- Southern Woodlands
- South Bay Warehouse Area
- Container Terminal 3
- West Coast Canal Industrial Complex
- Industrial Highway 357
- Kazama Style Traditional Martial Arts Dojo
- Deserted Temple
- Seahorse Grand Hotel
- Tekken Force, 4th Special Forces Operational Group Compound
- G Security Service, Operations Headquarters (random)
- Mishima Zaibatsu, Central Subway Line
- Mystic's Village
- Nightmare Train

One of the best stages for this trophy is "Nightmare Train", if you
haven't already obtained this trophy by the time you unlock this stage.
You have access to a Gatling Gun as soon as you start this stage (on the
opposite end of the train), and every enemy that you kill will still count
towards your total if you die.

Gatling Gun Controls:
1 (LP) or 2 (RP) = Shoot Gatling Gun
3 (LK) = Pick-up / Drop weapon



====================================================
Ready for Action                  Bronze      15 G
====================================================

Pick up 300 health recovery items in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: For this trophy, break every wooden crate that you see as they might
contain a health recovery item.  Also, defeated enemies might drop some
health recovery items.  Eventually, you will obtain this trophy.  It is
okay to repeat stages that you've already completed.



====================================================
Brute Force                       Bronze      15 G <UPDATE>
====================================================

Defeat 100 enemies with the Lead Pipe in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: To obtain this trophy, you will need to pick up a Lead Pipe that
you find on the ground or within a wooden crate and defeat as many enemies
as possible with it before it disappears from overuse.  It is okay to
repeat stages after you've cleared them.

The stages that I've seen that contain a Lead Pipe are:
- Fujian Tulou (right path from beginning of stage)
- West District, 13th Avenue
- Mishima Polytechnic
- West District, Chinatown
- Abyss Gate
- North Nature Park
- Aranami Stable
- Mishima Estate
- Central District, 11th Avenue
- Kazama Style Traditional Martial Arts Dojo
- Deserted Temple
- Violet Systems
- G Security Service, Operations Headquarters (random)
- G Corporation, Millennium Tower Heliport
- Azazel's Temple, Central Corridor

Lead Pipe Controls:
1 (LP) = Jabbing Attack
2,2 (RP,RP) = Baseball Swing Attack
1+2 (LP+RP) = Low Sweeping Attack
3 (LK) = Pick-up / Drop weapon



====================================================
Thirsty Fighter                   Bronze      15 G <UPDATE>
====================================================

Pick up 50 drink items in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: For this trophy, break every wooden crate that you see as they might
contain a drink powerup.  Also, defeated enemies might drop powerups.
Eventually, you will obtain this trophy.  It is okay to repeat stages that
you've already completed.



====================================================
Crate Breaker                     Bronze      15 G
====================================================

Destroy 100 wooden crates in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: For this trophy, you should try to break every wooden crate that you
come across.  In doing this, you should be careful because some crates
will contain enemies that will jump out and attack you once broken.



====================================================
Alien Hunter                      Bronze      20 G
====================================================

Defeat 10 aliens in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: If you find an alien on a level, you just need to attack it before
it runs away.  It is okay to repeat stages what you've already defeated
an alien on, as defeating them again will count towards the total.

I have seen aliens on the following stages:
- Southern Woodlands
- Container Terminal 3
- Abyss Gate
- Industrial Highway 357
- G Science and Technology, Research Building 3 (multiple aliens)
- Tekken Force, 4th Special Forces Operational Group Compound
- G Security Service, Operations Headquarters
- G Corporation, Millennium Tower
- Mystic's Village
- Azazel's Temple, Central Corridor
- Subterranean Pavilion (multiple aliens)
- Kigan Island (multiple aliens)
- Nightmare Train

By far, the best stage for encountering aliens is the hidden stage
"Subterranean Pavilion". Starting from the room with three Mokujins that
are waiting for you in Craig Marduk's "Ready Position", you will have an
opportunity to encounter multiple aliens (up to 8?).  Depending on how
fast you defeat all enemies before you get to your 5th floor will
determine how many aliens will appear.  The best way to defeat the enemies
quickly is to break the floor, which can be done by performing a move with
the "bound" property on an airborne opponent, or by performing a move that
slams the opponent to the ground.

Some examples of "bound" moves are:
* Bryan Fury - Chopping Elbow (b+1)
* Heihachi Mishima - Hammer Punch (d+1)
* Lei Wulong - Mauling Dragon (f,f+2)
* Paul Phoenix - Double Strike (b+1,2)

A list of bound moves is available below:

====================================================
Scenario Expert                   Silver      30 G <UPDATE>
====================================================

Clear all of the stages in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: For this trophy, you will need to clear all stages, including the
hidden stages.  The hidden stages are:
- Mishima Industries, Biotech Research Station Ruins (defeat the kangaroo
  within "Seahorse Grand Hotel" on any difficulty. You must choose to take
  the right path at the beginning of the stage.)
- Subterranean Pavilion (check the "Wooden Warrior" trophy)
- Kigan Island (check the "Eastern Explorer" trophy)
- Nightmare Train (check the "What A Nightmare" trophy)



====================================================
King of the Hill                  Bronze      20 G
====================================================

Knock 10 enemies in the water in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: On any level with water (such as "South Bay Warehouse Area",
"Container Terminal 3" and "Container Terminal 7"), you will just need
to knock enemies into the water.  You do no need to knock in all 10
enemies on the same level and enemies count even if you fail a stage.  You
should be careful because you can also easily be knocked into the water,
which will cause you to fail the stage.

Here are a few good moves that will help knock enemies into the water:
- King = "Toll Kick" (b+3) when their back is towards the water.
- Jack 6 = "Rotary Catapult" (f+1+3) when your back is towards the water.

There are a lot more useful moves, however I won't be listing them here.



====================================================
A Friend in Need                  Bronze      15 G
====================================================

Rescue your downed partner 3 times in Scenario Campaign Mode (single player).

TIP: For this trophy, you will only need to walk over to Alisa if she is
defeated by an enemy and revive her using the "X" (for PS3) button.  It
looks like you will only be able to revive your partner once per stage.



====================================================
Combo Amateur                     Bronze      10 G
====================================================

Perform a 10 chain combo in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: For this trophy, pick a character that you're familiar with.  Your
chain combo increases with every enemy that you or your partner defeats or
wooden crate that is broken.  After not defeating any enemies or breaking
wooden crates for a while, your chain combo will reset to 0 and you'll
have to start over.

Watching the cut scenes where the characters talk will most likely cause
your combo count to reset, however it is possible to skip those.



====================================================
Combo Enthusiast                  Bronze      20 G
====================================================

Perform a 30 chain combo in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: Same tip as the "Combo Amateur" trophy.



====================================================
Combo Master                      Silver      30 G
====================================================

Perform a 50 chain combo in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: Same tip as the "Combo Amateur" trophy.  I didn't get this trophy
until the "West Coast Canal Industrial Complex" stage, but it might be
possible to get it earlier.



====================================================
Upgraded Assistant                Bronze      15 G
====================================================

Upgrade Alisa to the highest possible level.

TIP: This trophy is obtained after Alisa reaches her maximum level, which
is level 10.  Alisa will level up while you clear stages within the
Scenario Campaign.  You will need to clear all stages, including the
hidden ones.  See the "Scenario Expert" trophy for info on unlocking the
hidden stages.



====================================================
What's So Special About It?       Bronze      20 G
====================================================

Obtain the Special Flag in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: The "Special Flag" is a yellow flag with a red letter "S".

You only need one special flag to obtain this trophy, but here are a few
locations where you can find one:
- On the "Container Terminal 3" stage, during the fight against Jack-6.
  It should be out in the open and you just need to walk over it during
  the fight.
- In a wooden crate right behind you in "Secret Underground Passage" as
  soon as you start the stage.  Just turn around and break open the wooden
  crate.
- In "Violet Systems", at the start of the fight against Lee Chaolan, a
  box will fall from the sky that contains the flag.
- "Tekken Force, 4th Special Forces Operational Group Compound", one of
  the soldiers will drop one within the warehouse before Eddy Gordo
  appears.
- "Mishima Zaibatsu, Central Subway Line", dropped by one of the soldiers.
- During the fight with Devil Jin on "Nightmare Train".



====================================================
No Key For Me                     Gold        45 G
====================================================

Clear the Millennium Tower stage without the boot-up key in Scenario
Campaign Mode.

TIP: This trophy is obtained after clearing "G Corporation, Millennium
Tower" in the Scenario Campaign Mode, after selecting not to use
NANCY-MI847J.



====================================================
Learning is Fun                   Bronze      15 G
====================================================

Clear the tutorial stage in Scenario Campaign Mode.

TIP: You will obtain this trophy after completing the very first stage of
the Scenario Campaign Mode, which is the tutorial stage.



====================================================
Moving On Up                      Bronze      20 G
====================================================

Win a Ranked Match in Online Mode.

TIP: You get this trophy for winning your first Ranked Match in the
Online Mode. You won't be able to create your own room like with the
"Player Match", so you have to rely on your skills for this trophy.



====================================================
No Pressure                       Bronze      20 G
====================================================

Win a Player Match in Online Mode.

TIP: You get this trophy for winning your first Player Match in the
Online Mode. If you're really having trouble getting a win, you can
create a room and invite a friend who would agree to let you win a match.



====================================================
Fighting Amateur                  Bronze      10 G
====================================================

Play 3 matches in Online Mode.

TIP: To obtain this trophy, you only need to complete a total of 3 matches
online. It can be any combination of "Ranked Match" and "Player Match",
and it doesn't matter if you win or lose.

To speed things up, create your own "Player Match" room and invite only
one friend.  Keep playing matches until this trophy is unlocked.  It is
okay to take breaks as the game will keep track of the total number of
matches played.



====================================================
Fighting Enthusiast               Bronze      20 G
====================================================

Play 10 matches in Online Mode.

TIP: Same tip as the "Fighting Amateur" trophy.



====================================================
Fighting Master                   Silver      30 G
====================================================

Play 30 matches in Online Mode.

TIP: Same tip as the "Fighting Amateur" trophy.



====================================================
Arcade Addict                     Bronze      15 G
====================================================

Clear the Arcade Battle in Offline Mode.

TIP: For this trophy, simply defeat Arcade Battle.  To speed things up,
go under the options and set the number of rounds to 1 and set the
difficulty to easy.



====================================================
Team Toppler                      Bronze      15 G
====================================================

Defeat 3 teams in Team Battle in Offline Mode.

TIP: Just go to "Team Battle" mode and play against the CPU.  To speed
things up, select to only fight against one opponent.  Also, you can
select any difficulty level.



====================================================
Survival of The Fittest           Bronze      15 G <UPDATE>
====================================================

Earn 10 consecutive wins in Survival in Offline Mode.

TIP: For this trophy, simply go to the Survival mode and obtain 10 wins.
You will receive this trophy right after your 10th win.

With Jin Kazama, you can do the "Corpse Thrust" (d+1) to knock the
opponent to the ground, then "Spinning Flare Kick" (4~3) while the
opponent is still on the ground.  Repeat.

With Devil Jin, you can do the "Corpse Thrust" (d+1) to knock the opponent
to the ground, then "Infernal Destruction" (3+4,1+2) while the opponent is
still on the ground.  Repeat.

With Kazuya, you can just do the "Roundhouse to Triple Kicks" (u/f+4,4,4,4)
the entire match.



====================================================
Practice Makes Perfect            Bronze      15 G
====================================================

Inflict a total of 1000 damage in Practice in Offline Mode.

TIP: Just go to "Practice Mode" and keep attacking your opponent until
this trophy pops up. You can go to the practice options menu and change
the "Attack Data" to "Type 2" to see exactly when you reach 1000 damage.
To speed things up, just pick a character and do an unblockable the whole
time (such as Lei Wulong's "Phoenix Strike" (AOP,f+4)) and should get this
trophy within a minute or two.



====================================================
Gallery Completionist             Gold        45 G
====================================================

Complete the Gallery.

TIP: You will obtain this trophy after unlocking all of the character
prologue artwork, character ending movies, and Alisa's Journal.  This will
require you to clear all stages of Scenario Campaign (including the three
hidden ones) as well as clear the Arena with all fighters.  To speed
things up, set the number of rounds to 1 from the Options menu.

Note that Kuma and Panda have separate stories, so you will have to clear
the Arena with both.  Lars and Alisa are the only characters without
ending movies.

Some people have reported being able to unlock ending movies by playing
matches outside of the Scenario Campaign, but I have not yet confirmed
this as I have unlocked all of my ending movies from the Scenario Campaign
Arena.



====================================================
Ghost Vanquisher                  Bronze      20 G
====================================================

Defeat 30 Ghosts.

TIP: For this trophy, you will have to obtain 30 wins against ghosts,
which are compueter A.I. designed to mimic the fighting style of an actual
human player.  To put it simply, a ghost is a computer A.I. that has a
name (other than the default character name).

Ghosts appear within the "Arcade" or "Ghost Battle" modes, but the fastest
method is to just go the "Ghost Battle" mode.

To help speed things up, set the number of rounds to 1 and always select
to fight the lowest ranked opponent.



====================================================
Love That Money                   Bronze      15 G <UPDATE>
====================================================

Collect more than 5,000,000 G.

TIP: You will obtain this trophy when you reach a total of at least
5,000,000 G combined from all of the game modes.  The easiest way to do
this is to play through the Scenario Campaign Mode.  It will help if you
equip your character and partner with a customization item that has the
"Increase Fight Money" special property.

It is okay to purchase customization items with your fight money because
the game will keep track of the money you've earned.  You can check your
progress from the main menu under Profile > Records.

To help speed things up, set the number of rounds you play to 1, as the
number of rounds doesn't seem to have any affect on your win bonus.



====================================================
Machine Crusher                   Silver      30 G
====================================================

Defeat NANCY-MI847J.

TIP: NANCY-MI847J (the huge robot) will show up as an extra stage every
time you make it to Stage 7 in the "Arcade Battle" mode.  This will
probably be your most difficult opponent in this game, even more difficult
than Azazel.  It has a lot of unblockables an even an instant kill where
it will use its laser to cut a while in the floor.

It looks to me that sidestepping to its right side (your left), then
attacking is the best approach.  A few times during the match, after
taking a certain amount of damage, it will be disabled a few seconds for
you to get in a few free hits.  This is probably the best time to get in a
high damaging attack, such as an unblockable.

I was able to defeat it using Paul Phoenix and doing the following moves:
- Double Strike (b+1,2)
- Phoenix Smasher (qcf+2)
- Burning Fist (b,b+1+2)

I was also able to defeat it using Bryan Fury and by doing the following
moves:
- Mach Breaker (f,f+2)
- Meteor Smash (b+1+4)

Here are some other tips:
- Remaining directly in front of it the entire match is NOT a good idea.
- It has a lot of health, but can't block.
- You can block its swinging fists attack.
- You can duck its gatling gun, but if you get hit by it, you should
  remain on the ground until it stops shooting.
- When it shoots missiles into the air, continue to sidestep until all of
  the missiles are gone.
- When it sticks its neck out to cut a circular hole into the ground, keep
  sidestepping, because you will instantly lose the match if you fall into
  the hole.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Azazel is easily one of the cheapest bosses in the history of the Tekken
series.  It has an ultimate defense where it can block both low and high
attacks at the same time, and it has the ability to block and attack at
the same time.  Sometimes, it will avoid unblockable attacks by vanishing
then re-appearing in mid-air.

From what I've seen, Azazel has a grab, one low attack (tail spin), one
unblockable (laser), and at least one guard break stun.  The rest of its
moves appear to either be high or mid.  Also, at least one of its attacks
gives guard damage (you will receieve a small amount of damage when the
attack is blocked).

One thing to note is that it still counts as a victory if you have more
life points than Azazel when the time runs out.

A strategy that seems to work with most characters is to do a quick Left
Right Punch Combo (1,2 or LP,RP) the entire match.  For some characters
that don't have a quick 1,2 punch combo (such as Asuka, Jack-6, Sergei and
Wang), you can do a Right Left Punch Combo (2,1 or RP,LP) instead.

Also, make sure to set the difficulty to Easy and the number of rounds to
1 under the Options menu.

Besides Lars and Alisa,  Marshall Law and Raven are the only fighters that
don't fight Azazel within the Scenario Campaign's Arena.

Zaibatsu might be of some help:

With the addition of online co-op for the Scenario Campaign mode, it has
become clear to me that some people don't know how to customize their
character with the special properties.  This section will attempt to cover
that information.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This section will cover how to customize a character on the console
version of Tekken 6.

NOTE: This section will only get updated if people ask questions or ask
      for clarification.


1. There are two ways to get to the Custromization menu
   a. From the main menu, select "Profile" then "Customize".
   b. From within the Scenario Campaign's single player mode, press the
      "Start" button, then select "Customize".
2. In the "Character Select" menu, select which character you want to
   customize.
3. Now, you will then need to select which costume you want to customize.
   1P Model = Outfit selected by pressing one of the punch buttons.
   2P Model = Outfit selected by pressing one of the kick buttons.
   3P Model = Special outfit exclusive to consoles.  Selected by pressing
              the Right Punch button.  Available for Anna, Armor King,
              Asuka, Baek, Craig, Jin, Kazuya, King, Lars, Lili, Ling,
              Roger Jr., Yoshimitsu (DLC), and Zafina.
4. After selecting an outfit to customize, you will be able to purchase
   customization items with your fight money, sell any items that you have
   (for less than the purchase price), or equip the items that you have
   available.  When you choose "Purchase", "Sell", or "Equip", you will
   see a list of the different body parts and sections available.
5. When you select "Equip", you will see a list of the different body
   parts and sections that you have customization items for.  When you
   select a body part or section, you will see a list of the available
   items that you have and can be equipped.  NOTE: For more info on the
   "Attributes", check out the "Scenario Campaign Customization Item
   Attributes" section below.
   a. An item that has already been purchased or earned and can be
      equipped will contain the word "Equip" in green text.
   b. An item that is already equipped will contain the word "Equipped" in
      green text.
   c. To remove an equipped item, select "Default" from the very top of
      the menu.
6. Customizing the hair is a little bit more complicated.  To start, you
   are required to purchase a base from the "Hair - Base" section before
   you purchase any of the other hair sections.  You will be unable to
   preview a hair item without a base first being equipped.
7. Exit back out by pressing the "Cancel" button when finished customizing
   your character.

Here are a few tips that might assist in completing some of the stages
within Scenario Campaign.


-------------------------------------------------
     General Tips
-------------------------------------------------


- Running out of time will cause you to fail a Scenario Campaign stage.

- Your partner being defeated will not cause you to fail the stage, but it
  will make things more difficult.  You are allowed to revive them once
  during a stage, but they cannot revive you.

- Customize your fighter with the customization items that you unlock, as
  they contain special properties that will help in passing the stages.

- Make sure to customize your partner, as the customization item
  properties will work for them as well.  The outfit that you choose
  (1P or 2P) will be the same outfit chosen by your partner.  For those
  fighters that have a 3P outfit, your partner will choose their 1P
  outfit.  If you always customize both of your partner's outfits, then
  this won't be an issue for you.

- Purchased customzation items will not contain any special properties
  when equipped.

- It is possible to obtain the same item with different properties.
  Anything that you don't want can be sold.

- I believe that whomever picks up the treasure chest will receive the
  customization item from that chest at the end of the stage.  So, if you
  want items for your character, you will have to pick up the treasure
  chests before your partner.  This appears to be true most but not 100%
  of the time.

- During the later stages, try to keep your partner alive as she will be
  very helpful.  If nothing else, they will serve as a distraction.  If
  your partner is low on heath, lead them to a recovery item.  For what
  I've seen, it is rare for them to manually pick up a health item, so you
  will need to make it so they walk over a health item when they follow
  you.

- I haven't seen any health recovery items or weapons disappear when left
  lying on the ground, so you should be able to leave them there until you
  need them.

- When the stage boss is defeated, all of their lackeys will be defeated
  as well.

- After defeating an enemy, be sure to press the "Switch Targets" button
  (R1 on PS3 by default) to switch to the next enemy, as the game will not
  automatically switch right away.

- On stages with floors that can be broken (such as "Abyss Gate",
  "Subterranean Pavilion" and "Kigan Island"), if you manage to break and
  fall through the floor, all enemies on the broken floor will be
  instantly defeated.



-------------------------------------------------
     G Security Service, Operations Headquarters
-------------------------------------------------


This stage might be a bit difficult as there are short metal rails on the
catwalk and you and your partner can be easily knocked off for an instant
death.  On this stage, it is also possible to perform a move that will
cause your death.  What makes things even worse is that you can clip
through the rails and fall to your death.

I would suggest picking a character like Bryan Fury and
do moves like "Snake Edge" (d/f+3), "One Two Body Blow" (1,2,1),
"Mach Breaker" (f,f+2), "Quick Low Screw Punch" (d+3,2), etc.

In the middle of the stage, you will come across a wooden crate that
will randomly give you one the the three available weapons.  I would
suggest leaving the weapon on the ground then come back for it before you
get to the two wooden crates at the end of the catwalk.  That way, you can
use the weapon in the boss fight.



-------------------------------------------------
     G Corporation, Millennium Tower
-------------------------------------------------


If you choose to use NANCY-MI847J (the huge robot), make sure to pause the
game and take a look at its command list.  A very good move is the
"Megawatt COIL Laser" (2+4), which will deal a huge amount of damage to
anyone directly in front of you.

If you just want to pass the level and not experiment, the only moves that
I would suggest using are "Megawatt COIL Laser" (2+4), "Charge Dash" (3)
and "30mm Gatling Gun" (1).

If you don't choose to use NANCY-MI847J, you will use your currently
selected fighter.  During the fight against Anna, if you're having trouble
with the submachine gunners, you can either try to take then out or stay
near the broken window where you first entered this area.  If you're close
enough to the broken window, you should be out of range from their fire.



-------------------------------------------------
     G Corporation, Millennium Tower Heliport
-------------------------------------------------


Nothing special about this stage.  You'll just have to fight a whole bunch
of enemies before Kazuya shows up.



-------------------------------------------------
     Mishima Zaibatsu, Central Subway Line
-------------------------------------------------


Nothing special about this stage.  Just try to stay away from the side of
the train with no rail.



-------------------------------------------------
     Mishima Zaibatsu, Central Tower
-------------------------------------------------


In this stage, you will have to do three different boss fights: 1) Nina,
2) Jin and 3) Alisa.

Nina shouldn't be difficult, but the submachine gunners can be annoying so
you might want to try taking them out as they appear.

Jin might give you a hard time. You might want to try taking out the
submachine gunners first or take out one and then stay far away from the
other.

Alisa has some devastating attacks, is quick, and is good at blocking.
She also has the ice elemental attack which can freeze you and leave you
vulnerable to an attack.  To make matters worse, Alisa can also regain
health when she does her taunt.  The two soldiers with her will both drop
large health recovery items when defeated, so you should try to take care
of them first and save the health items for when you need them during the
fight.

If you lose against Jin or Alisa, you will get to continue from the
beginning of their fight, as long as you choose to "Retry".

The first few times, I must admint that I had a bit of difficulty passing
this stage.  However, sometime after completing version 1.10 of this guide
I was asked for tips on passing this stage.  I've done really well with
Paul Phoenix in this mode, so decided to give him a try.  I was actually
able to complete this stage using Paul without any properties equipped.
With Paul, I mainly used the following moves:
- Hammer Punch to Power Punch (d+1,2)
- Phoenix Smasher (qcf+2)
- Shoulder Smash (d+1+2)
- Shredder (u/f+3,4) then a juggle



-------------------------------------------------
     Mystic's Village
-------------------------------------------------


I didn't find this stage difficult, as you will get assistance from some
of the villagers, and Zafina will join you at the end of the stage.



-------------------------------------------------
     Azazel's Temple, Central Corridor
-------------------------------------------------


To start this stage off, you will fight Kazuya and then Azazel as bosses.
You shouldn't have any trouble with Kazuya.  Azazel doesn't block as much
as he does in the Arcade and Arena modes, so you should be okay.  Paul
Phoenix's "Phoenix Smasher" (qcf+2) and "Hammer Punch to Power Punch"
(d+1,2) seems to work well.

After defeating Azazel, you will have to defeat some enemies while trying
to escape the building before it caves in. If you happen to get stuck
behind a falling pillar, you will fail the stage.  However, you will be
able to continue from the beginning of this part as long you you select
"Retry".

After escaping you will face Alisa, then Jin.  When fighting Jin, you
should try to take out the submachine gunners first, as they can be really
annoying.



-------------------------------------------------
     Nightmare Train
-------------------------------------------------


You will unlock this stage after clearing "Azazel's Temple, Central
Corridor".

This is probably the most difficult stage in the Scenario Campaign, as you
will face a very large amount of respawning enemies in a confined space.

Your partner  will continuously try to fight the enemies and not attempt
to try to pick up any health recovery items.  So, if you are not close to
your partner, they will not last very long.

The side of the train will 3 walls has two small chicken recovery items
along with a power boost drink, and the other side has 2 big chickens
along with a gatling gun.  I would recommend trying to stay near the side
with the gatling gun.

Devil Jin will appear after defeating all of the enemies that appear,
which will probably be sometime 200 seconds.

Think that you're finally done with all of the gargoyles?  Guess again!
After Devil Jin appears, another huge wave of gargoyles will also appear.

I think that your best hopes of defeating Devil Jin would be to try to
knock him off the train as early as possible, because you will pass the
stage as soon as he is defeated.  I was able to do this when my partner
launched him in the air, then I juggled him off the train.

For this level, I used Jin Kazama.  With Jin, some useful moves are:
- Demon's Paw (f,f+2)
- Corpse Thrust (d+1)
- Median Line Destruction (1+2)
- Left Right Combo (1,2)
- Right Sweep (d+4)
- Savage Sword (d/b+2,2,3)
There are other useful moves, but these are the main ones that I used.

In case you're wondering, I had the following special properties equipped:
- Elemental Attack: Ice [16%]
- Nullify Elemental Attack [89%]
- Increase Defense [8]
- Increase Attack [72%]
- Increase Health Meter [328]

The higher the percentages, the better.  The actual items equipped isn't
important, as the special property and percentage is randomly generated
for each customization item.

Another tip to clear this stage is to not use the Gatling Gun until Devil
Jin appears.  When he does appear and gets to the part of the train
without walls, you can easily knock him off the side of the train with a
few shots from the Gatling Gun.

In this section, I will try my best to answer some common questions I've
received through e-mail or saw on the forums.


----------
Question 1 - Scenario Campaign Partner
----------

Q: Is is possible to select your partner in the Scenario Campaign Mode?

A: As of version 1.02, you are not able to select your partner.  However,
   it might be possible via the game update that is scheduled to be
   released sometime this winter.


----------
Question 2 - Scenario Campaign Co-op <UPDATE>
----------

Q: Is there offline or online co-op for the Scenario Campaign Mode?

A: Update version 1.03 adds online co-op for the Scenario Campaign Mode,
   however there is no offline co-op.  From what I've read, there are no
   plans for offline co-op.


----------
Question 3 - Selecting Outfit after Customizing <NEW>
----------

Q: When I select a character after customizing them, they don't have the
   customizations equipped.  Am I doing something wrong?

A: Every fighter has two costumes: 1P (selected using Left Punch or Right
   Punch) and 2P (selected using Left Kick or Right Kick).  Some fighters
   have a 3P outfit (selected using Right Punch).  You'll have to select
   the outfit that you customize.

The main purpose of "Tekkenomics" is to provide you with Tekken FAQs/Guides
and to keep you updated on Tekken news and information.

"Tekkenomics" was originally the name of the website created by me
(Wild Man X), with help from Paulinstein and Drake the Demon, which first
came online on November 6, 2004.  However, due to someone engaging in
piracy on our hosting server the website went down in April 2007.  With
the release of Tekken 6 approaching for consoles, I decided to bring back
Tekkenomics, but in the form of a blog, back in June 2009.

"Tekkenomics" contains various Tekken related material, some of which is
difficult to find on any other Tekken based website.  The blog will
contain exclusive articles, original FAQ files, move lists, combos/juggles,
combo videos, in-game matches, Tekken commercials, PC desktop wallpaper,
PSP wallpaper, CG art, fan-based material, and other things.

If you're having problems visiting the "Tekkenomics Blog" at
http://www.tekkenomics.com, you can also visit it at the following link:
http://tekkenomics.wordpress.com

If you were wondering how we came up with the name "Tekkenomics", back in
my high school days in the year 2000, Paulinstein, me, and some other high
school friends would get together to play Tekken 3 on the PlayStation 1.
At the time, we were also enrolled in Economics. Whenever we would get
together to play, we would say that we were going to study some
"Tekkenomics".  So, basically: "Tekken" + "Economics" = "Tekkenomics".

There are a few references on the web to the name "Tekkenomics" that
aren't related to us or our blog.  There are some members on the Tekken
Zaibatsu forums that go by the names "Tekkenomics", "Tekkenomics_101",
and "TekkenNomics Jr." that aren't related to us. On Tekken Zaibatsu,
we go by the names "Wild Man X", "Paulinstein", and "Drake the Demon".
The things on the web that ARE related to us are at: GameFAQs, Neoseeker,
IGN, 1UP.com, Gamerhelp, Gamespot, MySpace, AIM, MSN Messenger, Hotmail,
GMail, YouTube, PicasaWeb, Blogger, WordPress, ImageShack, and Twitter.
