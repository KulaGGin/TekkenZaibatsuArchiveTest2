This is a very preliminary FAQ for Lili, one of the three new characters in
Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.

I have been playing Dark Resurrection since the initial release of the test
version at the Cyberstation at the HIP in Norridge, IL, so about 2 months
now.  I didn't play much Tekken before the release of Tekken 5 in December
of 2004 but since then it's taken up a lot of my time.  My main character
in Tekken 5 was Asuka but I can play about half of the cast pretty
comfortably.  Since the test version of the game my main character has
quickly switched to Lili.  I like her character design and she is very
unique when compared to the rest of the cast.

Special thanks to Nappy who has also been playing her since the test
version came out as well as pIchu from the tekkenzaibatsu.com forums for
his input as well as air juggles.

****Profile for Lili (Real Name - Emily)****

Name : Lili
Fighting style: Street Fighting
Nationality: Monaco
Age: 16

Lili is the only daughter of an oil tycoon residing in Monaco—she’s a true
daddy’s girl.

4 years ago, while being attacked by a criminal group making profits from
kidnappings, Lili suddenly became violent, and unexpectedly floored one of
her attackers, it was at that moment that she first realized she took
pleasure in defeating her opponents. However, deep down inside, Lili is a
gentle person, she only wants to please her father, but she knows that he
despises fighting. Troubled by her situation, she tells herself, “I don’t
want father to hate me…but I want to continue fighting.” Her desire to
fight couldn’t be contained, and for this reason, she uses a private jet
to travel abroad to take part in street fights, which she enjoyed
immensely.

One day, after defeating an opponent in San Francisco, she acquired an
invitation to martial arts tournament. Lili noticed that the sponsor of
the tournament, the Mishima Financial Group, caused her father much
trouble. With the assumption of the Mishima Financial Group becoming a
useful asset to her father, she was determined to take part in the
tournament.

Ten Strings


4,1,3,3,3,4,3,1,3+4,3+4 — H,H,M,M,M,L,L,M,M,Unblockable
4,1,3,4,4,3,4,4,3+4 — H,H,M,M,L,L,M,M,M
4,1,3,3 - H,H,M,M,M

This is the official move list, found by kurichan of tekkenzaibatsu.com.
This is not the entire move list, however.  I'll cover each move in the
next section.

-----------

****Moves/Ratings****
This section covers all of the moves listed above, and some additional
moves that are not.  I have rated move from either 1 to 5 stars depending
on it's usefulness, safety, and damage

1,2 - H,H - (*****)

2 jabs.

Lili's 8 frame punisher.  I love this move so much.  Both hits are a
natural combo.  The first hit is +1 frames on block.  For both hits it's
even frames on block.  Even though there are two different follow-ups to
her jabs, most of the time it's better to just do her 1,2 jabs.



1,2,3 - H,H,L (**   ) One Two Low Trap

2 jabs into a low kick.

This is a so-so offensive tool.  The third hit is delayed a lot and will
high crush, but even on hit this move leaves you at a disadvantage and
very close to your opponent in a situation where you'll more than likely
have to guard their next attack.  I use this very rarely, I'd rather do 1,2
followed by d+4.



1,2,4 - H,H,M (***  ) One Two Spine Shot

2 jabs into a jumping kick.

A little bit better than 1,2,3.  Lili does two kick jabs into her drill
kick.  This move can catch people off guard just because the kick is
delayed so much but your opponent can jab between 1,2 and the 4.  It's a
decent mix-up only because they might be expecting a low and the kick comes
out relatively fast as far as the animation.  Still, this isn't something
that I use very often.  It knocks down on regular and counter hit.  It's
also a great juggle ender.



2,3 - H,L (***  ) Quick Low Trap

1 jab into a low kick.

A bit better than 1,2,3 just because the whole move is faster, but the low
at the end is the exact same thing, and puts you at a disadvantage on hit.
Still, it is a decent match ending move just because the low can catch
people off guard.



2,4 - H,H (***  ) Arch Kick Combo

A quick jab followed by a front roundhouse kick.

Another decent offensive tool.  It puts you at even frames on block and
knocks down on regular and counter hit.  Both hits are high however and the
second hit can be ducked.  This is a good move to set people up on the
wall.

1+2 - M (**** ) Triangle Spread

A double palm strike.

I like this move a lot.  It's similar to Baek's old 1+2 in 5.0 as far as
how it looks.  It knocks down on regular and counter hit.  Because of the
new system however, your opponent can do a quick rollback (~b) after it
hits.  But if they don't, take a few steps forward and you can hit all
of d/f+3+4,3+4, BT d+3.  This move is -12 frames on block and somewhat
punishable but it's not too bad.  This move is best used to punish people
yourself because it comes out really fast.



3+4 or BT 3+4 - M (**** ) Vertical Axis

A really high jump in the air.

This is one of those moves that makes Lili unique.  She jumps up high into
the air and either lands on her opponents head and flips them up for free
hits or knocks them down on the ground (on CH).  If she does this from her
back turn stance she can even get a juggle from it!  (E.G. BT 3+4, 1,2,
d+3,3,4).  Either way, Lili's opponent is knocked on the ground.  This move
even beats out other stomping attacks like Wang and Julia's u/f+3+4.  Also
this move is surprisingly safe on block and crushes everything.  I don't
use it a ton only because it may whiff but it's great if they are cornered
and have no place to go.



f+2, 1+2 - M (**** ) Pendulum Spread

Quick jab followed by a double palm strike.

This is very similar to her double palm strike as far as the oki options
afterward.  That's one of the reasons why I rated this so high.  The other
reason is because it makes a great juggle ender.  It's also only -10 on
block as opposed to 1+2 which is -12.



f+3 - M (***  ) Circle Knee

Lili spins in a circle and hits you with her knee.

I don't believe this move is safe however it's a great option against side
steppers and against people that tech.  This move is weird because on hit
it knocks them down on the ground to the side.  I don't have much to say
about this move even though I use it often.



f+4 - H (***  ) Arch Kick

Round house kick, second part of 2,4

Lili stands on one leg and kicks with the other in a circle.  To be honest
I haven't found much use for this move except for against the wall.  This
move does give you +5 frames on block so it's great for setting up CHs and
keeping the pressure on.  It can be ducked however.



f+1+2 - M (**   ) Side Slap

To be honest, I haven't found much use for this move.  I don't suggest
using it often.



f+3+4 and f+3+4,3,4 - M,M and M,M,M,M (*****) Clock Kick and Delayed Clock
Kick Return.

Lili does a cartwheel.  In the second version she delays her foot and then
does a back flip.

This is another one of Lili's great signature moves.  First, f+3+4 is a
good offensive tool just because of the alternate version people will be
more likely to just block it but fear the alternate version.  I also use
this a TON as a combo ender because it makes them land on the ground right
in front of you!  It's similar to Christie and Eddy's f+3+4.  I really
recommend this move.  The second version lets you delay the second hit
and come down with her heel.  At first I thought it would be good as a
delay move to catch people off guard.  The problem is if they try to attack
with a jab, they will get in between the hits.  The best situation to use
this move in is if your opponent is laying on the ground in front of you
fearing a tech trap, because if you get f+3+4,3 off, the 4 is guaranteed.
The entire string is about 20 percent damage, and on a grounded opponent
it makes a huge difference.  If you mix up your wakeup game, believe me you
will get this move off a lot more often, even if you just mix it up with f+
3+4 and they think they can get up right away.



d/f+1 - M (*****) Diffusion Hand

Quick open hand mid jab.

This move is a great standard d/f+1 move similar to Nina's d/f+1 in many
respects.  In the test version I am currently playing it is +1 on block
but I have heard that it is -1 on block in the final version B.  Still,
I believe this is a great offensive tool.  I use this for mind games, mix
it up with jabs, and throw after almost every time this hits.  It's one of
Lili's best tools.  It makes people afraid to duck just because it comes
out so fast.  This is definitely one of my favorite moves.



d/f+2 - M (**** )

Lili does a spinning fist that launches you in the air.

This is Lili's only completely safe standard launcher.  That is the only
reason why it rated it so high.  It doesn't have very good range and
doesn't launch crouchers (except on CH)!  Still, I have to give it credit
just because you have slightly more options on launch when compared to u/f+
3, and it comes out semi fast.  Launching with this can lead to about 45
percent juggles however so spam the heck out of it because it's safe!



d/f+3 - M (**** ) Hooking Heel

Lili lifts her knee up in the air.

I thought this move was dumb at first, especially when she has d/f+4,4. It
is certainly not as fast as d/f+4,4 but the good thing about the move is if
it hits you get d/f+4,4, for free anyway!  Even if they are teching or back
rolling and this hits you get the full d/f+3, d/f+4,4 combo.



d/f+4<4 - M,L (***  ) Shutup Stomp

Lili lifts up her knee and then stomps into the ground.

Another one of Lili's signature moves.  I didn't rate it that high.  It's
not safe and just like Asuka's strings it is very easy for a decent player
to block and even low parry.  Still, it is like Lee's laser kicks and can
tear through scrubs like nothing else.  You can't rely on this on good
players.  The good thing about this move is that the second hit can be
delayed A LOT and if the second hit is a CH, this move will knock them down
right in front of you for free oki.  I actually mix this up with f,f+4
because it throws people off.



d/f+3+4, 3+4 - M,M,M (*****) Back Flip Spinning Edge

Lili does two back flips.

This move is great!  It's great for oki, setups, and combos.  I avoid the
entire string if my opponent is standing up.  Between the first two hits,
he can jab right through it.  However, if they are rolling back, or are
grounded from another move (1+2, or f+2,1+2, or u/f+4,3, or d+2,2,4) you
can get this entire string plus an additional BT d+3!  The other great
thing about this attack is that you can combo off of d/f+3+4.  My favorite
combo is d/f+3+4,BT d+1,WS+2, d+1,2,4.  This combo is very beautiful, and
also very damaging.  You can hit this move off at long range so it works
great as a whiff punisher.  Also, even if they block you are only at a -2
frame disadvantage and the BT options are terrific.  I'll discuss her BT
options at the end of the move list.  This is a great move to keep the
pressure on your opponent, stay in their face, and keep them guessing!



d+1,2,4 - L,H,M (***  ) Paddling Beat

Low then high jab, followed by a roundhouse kick.

I can't say that I use this move all to often.  First of all, it is unsafe.
Second of all, it is easily blocked.  There are a couple redeeming factors
to this move.  It is very good on the wall.  Second, the first d+1 moves
you forward slightly and is an ok low poke.  Third, it is very good for her
unorthodox juggles off of stun moves (d+1,2, d+1,2,4 is a good combo from
many launchers and stuns.)  It's best to just stick to just using this in
combos.



d+2<2<3 - M,H,H (**   ) Bloody Masquerade Hurricane

Two quick jabs followed by a roundhouse kick.

I'm not % sure if the first two hits can be delayed.  To be honest I only
use this as a juggle ender and not so much in combos.  Your opponent can
jab throw the second and third hit.  The only reason why I rated it so high
is that it's an awesome juggle ender.  d+2,2 is ok by itself I guess.



d+2<2<4 - M,H,M (**    ) Bloody Masquerade Lance

Two quick jabs followed by a straight kick.

Almost the exact same thing as Bloody Masquerade Hurricane, except it
doesn't work quite so well in juggles.  The only time I will use this is if
I see a wall coming and I know that the first or second hit will hit on the
wall because this connects better than d+2,2,3.



d+3+4 - M (*****) Matterhorn Canon

Lili leans down and kicks up with both legs, shooting her opponent high
into the air.

More great Lili juice.  Seriously, this move is like butter.  It's ultra
punishable on block (-18) but the damage that you get from this launcher
is ridiculous.  On top of that, she ducks down so low that not only does
she crush highs, she avoids some mids as well.  I clearly went under Paul's
Phoenix Smasher once with this move.  There are a ton of options afterward
as well (see the combo section below) that there's no reason besides safety
not to use this move.  If you know for sure that a high is coming, this
should be your number one option.  This also works after a low kick parry.


d/b+3 - L (**** ) Freesia Thrust

Lili falls down a little bit and kicks with her leg.

This is definitely one of Lili's better lows.  It knocks down on hit, and
FC, d/f+3 is a guaranteed follow-up.  It's also somewhat hard to read.  It
hits grounded as well and may knock your opponent down again if you use it
in your oki game.  This move crushes highs.  I like this move a lot.



d/b+4 - L (***  ) Edelweiss

Lili does a crouching spin kick.

Another one of Lili's decent low attacks.  This also hits grounded.  On CH,
there is a combo afterward.  This isn't one of my favorite moves because it
is very readable.  It does crush highs though.  I use this move very
rarely.



b+1 - M (**** ) Stone Garden

Lili puts one hand to her side and does a karate chop motion on her
opponent.

I thought this move was ok at first.  It doesn't have really good range.
The three good things about this move are that it gives you a +3 frame
advantage on block, it puts your opponent into crouching on hit and block,
and on counter hit, you get a free juggle.  It's a super good move, but
don't expect to use it much just because the range is so short.



b+2,1~b - H,H (**   ) Heliotrope

Lili does two jabs, which can leave her in back turn.

I honestly don't think this move is that great other than juggle filler.
Even though you can end this move in back turn, it has too much lag when
compared to something like d/f+3+4.  The fact that this move leaves you in
back turn can leave you with some interesting options in juggles.



b+3 - H (*    ) Round Cutter

Spinning Kick.

I don't have much to say about this move either.  I just don't use it.  If
you need a move like this, use f+4 instead.  This move leaves you at a
disadvantage on block anyway.  Some people have used this is combos.



b+4~f - Special Movement (***  ) Rabbit Air~Parade Step

Lili jumps and spins to the right side and then does an immediate crouch
dash if you hold forward.

I wouldn't say that this move on it's own is incredibly useful.  It's good
if people are trying to lock you down and you want to get out of the way,
then turn the match around by using one of Lili's crouch dash options (which
are CD 1, CD 2, CD 3,4 or CD 4.



b+4~3 - L (**** ) Rabbit Tail

Lili jumps and spins to the side, then comes in with a sweep.

I like this move a lot.  It's a great low, and you can follow it up with
a free WS 3 if you are close enough, or whatever oki or wakeups you want.
You can even mix it up with b+4~4 or b+4~f into whatever mids you want to
keep them guessing.  It has a lot of range also.  The only bad thing about
this move other than it's not completely safe, is that sometimes it doesn't
track well, which can leave your back to your opponent, but for Lili this
is not necessarily a bad thing.  This move is a high crush.



b+4~4 - L (***  ) Rabbit Spine Shot

Lili jumps and spins to the side, then does a jumping drill kick.

This move is pretty average.  Mix it up with b+4~3.  It low crushes many
moves and like b+4~3 has bad tracking.  It knocks down on regular and
counter hit.



b+1+2 - M (**   ) Dendorobium 

Lili leans back and then comes forward to knock down her opponent.

I don't have much to say about this move.  It can avoid attacks but I
haven't had much success with it.  It knocks down however.



b+3+4 - Spcl. Mvmt. (***  ) Flip Mirror

Lili stands in place and turns around.

This is one of the moves that got nerfed after the first test version. She
used to take a step back as well as turn around but now she just spins in
place.  It's good if you need to set up back turn moves but overall I think
that d/f+3+4 is a better option just because when she is back turn she
can't move forward unless it's with BT 4,3+4.



b+1+4 - Unblockable (M) (***  ) Spine Shot ff

Lili winds up and does her jumping drill kick.

This unblockable isn't super useful, however it is one of the better
unblockables in the game.  First of all it comes out somewhat fast.  Second,
it hits mid so they can not duck it.  Third, because she is jumping your
opponent must either attempt to sidestep it or try to jab you out of it
in the air.  I use it a decent amount.



u/f+3+4,3+4 - M,M (****) Wing Knee Cannon

Lili jumps forward with both legs then leans down and shoots both her legs
into the air to launch her opponent.

This move is great for a few reasons.  First, u/f+3+4 by itself hops over
lows and is totally safe on block.  It is also great to use in juggles.
Second, the follow up is a high and sometimes mid crush so if you're
opponent tries to jab right after you doing the Wing Knee part, you will
launch them for a ton of damage.  However good players will catch on to
this.  This is the beauty of the move.  Because if they start fearing the
second hit, they will stand and block and you can continue your offense
with whatever move you desire.  Also if you see them trying to jab again
you can go back to doing the entire string.  The only bad thing about this
move is that the second part is incredibly unsafe on block.



u/f+4,3 - M,M (***  ) Mustang Lance 

Lili does a jump kick followed by a standing straight kick.

This move is good because it is a natural combo and knocks down.  It does
a lot of damage as well.  On hit, if they don't do a quick rollback (~b)
you can get a free d/f+3+4,3+4,BT d+3 or whatever other oki you like.  The
first it is a low crush.  



u/f+3 - M (*****)

Lili does a hop kick.

This is my absolute favorite move with Lili.  Even though it's not in her
complete move list, it is an important part of her game.  This move
crushes lows like nothing else.  It has almost phantom range and can be
used if your opponent whiffs almost anything.  It is merely jab punishable
and is worth the risk.  It's fast enough that if you were block something
low that is unsafe, you can do this move right afterward rather than a WS
move.  Also this move is guaranteed after both low punch and low kick
parry.  Combos off this move lead to approximately 45% damage.  This move
is also great to use against wakeup kicks, or any other wakeup moves
your opponent has because it will fully launch them into the air.  It can
even catch back rollers.  THIS IS HER NUMBER ONE MOVE.



f,f+2 - M (***  ) Aronjebra Pierce 

Lili dashes forward into and punches.

I can't say that I use this move all too often since it used to be her qcf+
2.  The good thing about this move is that it will stun on CH for a free
mini juggle.  Other then that, I don't think it's that great.



f,f+3,3+4 - M,M,M (**   ) Alstromeria  

Lili does a jump kick followed by a cartwheel in the air.

Another move that I don't use a lot.  It's not a terrible move, it's just
very slow and doesn't track well.  It does a lot of damage on hit but it's
one of the easiest moves to sidestep, and it leaves Lili wide open. I would
avoid using this attack very often.



f,f+4 - L (**** ) Alto Rodeo

Lili hops forward and stomps the ground.

This is a great low move.  It doesn't knock down but it will stun Lili's
opponent on CH.  I mix it up with d/f+4<4 a bit.  The only bad thing about
this move is that it can be easily stepped and it's best to use if you're
keeping the pressure on.



f,f+3+4 - M (***  ) Spine Shot

Lili jumps forward with a drill kick.

This move is alright.  It's relatively fast and knocks down.  It also
crushes low attacks.  It gives you a massive block stun but not frame
advantage.  I use it from time to time.



qcf+1 - M (*****) Vine Slash

Lili does a crouch dash into a backhand launcher.

I like this move a lot.  It's jab punishable, but that is the only
negative thing about it.  First, it has a lot of range, Lili's juggles off
of this move take about 45% damage, and this move will go under highs as
well has some mid attacks.  It's a great offensive tool and one of her
best launchers.  You can even use this in juggles after WS 2 and d+3+4. This
move is also referred to as CD 1.



qcf+2 - M (**** ) Shanze Strike

Lili does a crouch dash into a punch.

This move is alright.  I rated it high for a couple reasons.  First, you
can mix this up with CD 1 to keep them guessing when to punish, because
that move is not safe, and this one totally is.  Second, it will stun on
CH for a juggle.  This move is also referred to as CD 2.



WS 1 - M (***  ) En Garde

Lili does a fast rising punch.

This move is ok, it's her second fastest WS move.  On CH you can juggle
right afterward as well.  I don't have a lot to say about this move even
though I use it often.



WS 2 - M (**** ) Rising Baton

Lili does a longer version of her d/f+2.

This move is a great punisher for really unsafe lows.  It launches her
opponent way into the air for at least 50% juggles.  This move is not safe
but not horribly unsafe however.  It won't work on many lows because it is
kind of slow, but still it has a lot of range and is a great launcher.



WS 3,4 - M (***  ) Honey Circle

Lili does a backwards cartwheel followed by a front heel drop.

This move is OK.  From what I understand, in version B you can not juggle
after this launcher other than with just the second hit of this move. This
is unconfirmed however.  It doesn't have much range, and is not safe, but
it does put you out of range to be punished by most characters.  You can
also do this out of Lili's Parade Step (qcf) and it will hit techrollers.



WS 4 - M (**** )

Lili does a quick kick straight into the air from a ducking position.

This is a standard WS move but still worth mentioning because it's one of
her better WS options.  You can also do this move by doing Parade Step 4
or qcf+4. On CH this move stuns her opponent and you can juggle them.  This
may have been changed in version B of the game however.



FC, d/f+3 - L (**** ) Horizon Slide

Lili does a slide on the ground.

I like this move a lot.  Even if it's not incredibly safe, it has a ton of
range and can catch people off guard.  If you side step before it sometimes
she will slide right through them and they can't punish it.  You can also
juggle after this move because it trips them on counter hit.  This move
is a high crush.



SS 3 - M (**   ) Shirin Dart Kick

Lili's sidesteps and does a straight kick into the air, launching her
opponent.

In my opinion, Lili's side step game is very weak.  This move is a side
step launcher, but it comes out so slow that even if you clearly sidestep
some moves, they may have time to recover and block it.  It's not safe on
block either.  Still, I use this move sometimes because it's very
rewarding, much like any of Lili's launchers.



SS 1+2 - M (*    ) Minuet

Lili steps to the side and punches her opponent.

This move is complete garbage.  It comes out so slow, and has some of the
most horrible tracking I have ever seen.  Avoid it!



BT 4,3+4 - M,M,M,M (*****) Hanged Kick Spinning Edge

Lili does two backward cartwheels, leaving her in back turn position.

Now here is an annoying move!  Not only is the first hit completely safe
on block (and possibly the second hit) but it can run down opponents who
try to attack through it, and it even hits grounded.  The first part is
both a high and low crush.  I don't do the entire string very often
because the first and second parts can be jabbed through, but even if you
do just do the first part, you will stay in back turn for a mix-up.


BT 1+2 - M,M (**** ) Tempest

Lili turns around and comes down with two kick palm swipes.

Another great move!  This move knocks down on regular and counter hit, and
even on block leaves your opponent in a crouching position.  It comes out
really fast, so use it in her BT mix-ups.



BT d+3,4 - L,M (**** ) Antelope Kick

Lili does a back turned low kick followed by another kick with her other
leg to the chest.

I like this move a lot, because the first part crushes highs, and the
second hit is guaranteed on CH.  Not only that, if you are keep the
pressure on, your opponent will be forced to block because in many cases,
if they try to low crush the first hit, it will whiff.  This move does
a ton of damage and knocks down.



BT d+3+4 - L (***  ) Flat Trip                             |

Lili does a long range sweep from back turn, and returns to back turn.

This move is good, even though I don't use it very often because of it's
readability.  However if it hits, it will knock down and you can get
another one for free.

****Top 10 Moves****

d/f+1 -1 on block, decent punisher, awesome pressure tool, good to setup
throws or whatever short range move's you'd like.

1,2 8 frame jab punisher. 1 by itself is +1 on block.

d+3+4 high and sometimes mid crush. Bad recovery but worth the risk and
damage. Guaranteed after low kick parry.

u/f+3 low crush, phantom range, almost 50 percent damage after launching
with this. Jab punishable but that's about it.

d/f+2 Safe, spammable launcher. Doesn't launch crouchers but it's a good
launcher nonetheless.

d/f+3+4 Great whiff punisher, leads to a great combo (d+1, WS2, d+1,2,4).
Great mix-ups out of back turn on block (d+3,4, u/f+4, 1+2, or even throw)

f+3+4,3,4 I would recommend not doing this against a standing opponent
because they can jab in between f+3,4 and 3 but if they're on the ground
and the 3 part hits, 4 is guaranteed. Lots of damage.

f+3 Semi fast side kick. Hits side steppers and knocks down.

CD 1 Oh god, I can't say enough good things about this launcher. It's
another one of those moves that'll some time go under mid moves. I love it.
It's another great whiff punisher.  However it's not safe but only jab
punishable.

d/f+1+2 Her 1+2 throw, seems hard to break, it's a good fast option if
you're keeping the pressure on with d/f+1.

****Combos/Juggles****

** note ** These combos have all been tested by me, in the test version "2"
of Tekken 5 : DR.  The US version of DR is imminent in the US so I'll be
sure to test everything when it is released (Tekken 5 : DR, Version B).
Lili is the queen of all jugglers and has a lot of possible combos, I  will
only enter in those that are useful, damaging, or just plain unique.  I'll
mark the most common ones that I use with a star (*).  If you are unfamiliar
with Tekken notation, please review the legend on www.tekkenzaibatsu.com or
