I'm assuming that you know the conventions such as 1_2 and so on.  Here's just
a rundown on all the buttons and directions.

     Facing Right                             Facing Left

     UB  U  UF                                UF  U  UB   
       O O O                                    O O O
        \|/         (1)  (2)                     \|/         (1)  (2)
     B O-N-O F                                F O-N-O B
        /|\         (3)  (4)                     /|\         (3)  (4) 
       O O O                                    O O O
     DB  D  DF                                DF  D  DB        

And here are the notations of a command.

u,d,f,b: Tap direction                    U,D,F,B: Hold direction
    qcf: Quarter Circle Forward               qcb: Quarter Circle Back
      N: Neutral(no joystick direction)
     WS: While Standing from crouch            FC: Fully Crouched
      *: Hold the button                       SS: Side step (u_d)
     CH: Counter hit (interrupt an opp's move)  ~: Input next command immediately       
      1: Left Punch                             2: Right punch
      3: Left Kick                              4: Right Kick

<------------------->
 <Move_Explanation>
<------------------->

The moves that what i am about to explain here are based on my perspective.

<1, 1, 3>

---> A double high punch followed by a mid kick, best used as a juggle ender.

<1, 2>

---> Basic 1, 2 Punch, punishable on block and has a very slow recovery time for a basic 1-2 jab.

<1, 2, 1>

---> Another 1 of his jab string, this one is a bit useful cause of the slight guard stun on the last 1 if blocked,  it also knocks the opponent away
       on a clean hit and CH. Can be used as a juggle ender as well.

<1, 3, 2>

---> This move reminds me of Feng's 1, 3 followed by the 2nd part of Lei's DRK 3, 2(the overhead smash). But sergei's version is quite unique 
       because it can be linked to a throw if your opponent 'turtles' on you; the throw on this move is a headlock takedown.

<2, 1, 3>_<2, 1, 4>

---> Another one of his punch-kick strings has 2 kinds of ender, the 3(which hits high and best used as a juggle ender) and 4(a low kick). 
       A good set-up for this move is delaying the 2, 1 and confuse your opponent with either a mid hitting move or the 4.

<3+4>

---> A weird looking dropkick move that hits low?? haven't found a good use for it yet.

<f+2, 4>

---> A high elbow followed by a mid knee: has a slight delay in the middle of the move(after f+2) that can confuse some opponents.

<f+4, 4>_<f+4, d+4>

---> This move is similar to Lee's 4, 4, 4 kick string, the f+4, 4 string both hits high and the f+4, d+4 string hits high then low its rather slow though.

<f+3>

---> A mid hitting front kick(think of Raven's d/f+3 only it doesn't Juggle) i only use this in the middle of a juggle such as d/f+2, 1, f+3, d+4, 1, 3.

<f+1+2>

---> A spinning elbow move similar to Bruce's f+1+2.It hits high and has a long recovery time. Also causes guard stun on block.

<d/f+1>

---> This move is similar to Raven's d/f+1(think he's stolen enough??).This move also interrupts some strings.

<d/f+2> 

---> An Uppercut move that juggles on hit either clean or CH, use this after a low parry or on crouching opponents.

<d/f+3>

---> Similar to the Mishimas' f, F+3, on a clean hit it causes 'kneel stun' on your opponent, on a CH it becomes a throw.

<d+1>

---> A mid hitting elbow similar to Craig's d+1, haven't used this on a match yet. [on CH it leaves your opponent FD/FA]

<d+2>

---> Similar to Raven's qcf+2, its a low swipe looking move that leaves you crouching after the move. Has numerous set ups after the move such as
       d+2, WS 2(for a launcher) WS 3_1, 3(knocks your opponent away on hit or pushes them a little bit on Block).

<d+3, 4>

---> I can't stop thinking of him stealing most of the Characters' moves;again this move is similar to Raven's d+3 only sergei has another kick
       after his d+3 that hits mid. This move also has a delay after the d+3 which confuse opponents mostly.

<d+4, 1, 3>

---> Similar to the Anna/Nina's d+4,1 only with a different animation but this is one of his best moves and his best juggle ender.

<d+4, 4, 3>

---> Finally! an original move! Anyway, this move starts with a low kick followed by high kick then a spinning mid kick, best used on grounded opp-
      -onents who's either rolling back or standing up, this move hooks them up.

<d/b+2, 1, 2>

---> Another Original move. Its a punch string that hits all mid.This move can be delayed on the last hit but it also leaves you
       open so use this only if your opponent doesn't know how to block it or mix it up with one of his strings.

<d/b+3>

---> A sweep move like most characters have. The good thing about this move is it can be cancelled into a throw(1+2). A good set up for this 
      move is when your opponent anticipates the sweep only to be grabbed. hehehehe.. ;D

<b+1>

---> Is it me or did he steal most of their moves?? This move is similar to nina's f, F+1, haven't found a set up or use for it yet.

<b+2, 1, 3>

---> A mid/low punch followed by a high punch then a sweep. The sweep on this move can be cancelled into a throw(good for confusing your opponent)
       For a good set up try: b+2, WS 1+2 its slow but useful.

<b+3, 1>

---> Another move stolen from Marduk and this time its his d/f+3, 1. but sergei's version doesn't launch but stuns on CH. If the move hits on CH
       try this: b+3, 1(CH), d/f+1, d+4, 4,. [the b+3 stuns on CH]

<b+4, 2, 1> <b+4, 2, 1+2>

---> A back kick followed by hammer-like punch then a "tundra tackle". There are 2 variations of this move,1) as 1 instead of 1+2 to get a front-
       punch.2) use this to confuse opponents.

<b+4, 3> 

---> The same kick used above only after that, a powerful high kick follows up. there's a slight delay between the move so it can be useful for
       bulldog opponents.

<b+1+2> 

---> Think of the last part of his (f, F+1+2) the one with the axe handle-like move. though its not that useful but it causes guard stun on block.

<b+3+4>

---> Same as Lei's (f+4). It hits high and has a long recovery time, quite useless.

<b+2+3>

---> Sergei's Unblockable move same as bryan's (b+1+4).It has a slow start up time and reach.

<u/b+2>

---> Think of nina's (f, F+2) you'll get the idea. 

<u/f+2>

---> Again think of feng's (u/f+2) hits mid and causes guard stun on block??

<u/f+4>

---> Yet Again think of the second part of raven's (u/f+4, 4) leaves you close to your opponent after hit so you can follow it with d+4, 1, 3.

<u/f+3+4> 

---> A hurricarana leg grab that is unblockable hits high and does quite a damage.

<f, F+2>

---> Almost Everyone has a f, F+2 command and mostly they are for offensive strikes and sergei's isn't different. use this at your disposal
       and it stuns on CH. But Wait! you can cancel this into a grab by pressing 1+2 before the 2 hits and it can be cancelled again by B.

<f, F+3>

---> A high hitting power kick move that pushes the opponent slightly away even if he blocks it. This move can also be seen in <2, 1, 3>, <1, 3>, WS 3.

<f, F+4>

---> This move was stolen from paul, it hits grounded opponents.

<qcf+2>

---> One on my favorite moves, it launches your opponent on a clean hit and CH and causes slight guard stun on Block. :D

<qcf+ 4>

---> A knee strike-like move, on CH it becomes a throw link move press: 1, 3, 4, 2 for left hand grab and 2, 2, 4, 3, 1 for right hand grab.

<qcf+1+2>

---> A shoulder tackle move good as a juggle ender and after a wall stun.

<f, f, F+2>

---> Think of a Running f, F+2, it really causes a powerful guard stun on Block.

<f, f, F+4>

---> A running knee lift that on CH becomes a Throw, hits mid.

<WS 1, 3>

---> See f, F+3.

<WS 2>

---> Again one of my favorite moves, it automatically launches your opponent. Use this after you duck a high hitting move or after you block a low
       hitting move.

<WS 3> 

---> See f, F+3.

<SS 2, 3>

---> A Circular Chop followed by a high kick. Dont use this often cause your opponent can duck the kick.

<SS 2, 1+2, 4>

---> A circular chop followed by a high-mid punch combination and another high kick.

<SS 2, 1+2, 1+2>

---> Same as above only it ends with a tundra tackle.

<WG SD 1+2>

---> When your knocked down(FC/FA) Like Lei's d+1+2, press 1+2 and Sergei does a special animation, he crawls like spiderman only its on the
       ground.

<OG d+3+4>

---> Similar to Kazuya's d+4(Grounded Opponent only), he stomps to the ground. Use this only when you know your opponent is just gonna
       lie there for a guaranteed hit.

THROWS:

<1+3 or f+1+3> 

---> He does an armbar-submission like move.

<2+4 or f+2+4>

---> He does a fireman's carry toss move then he kicks the opponent to side while being tossed away.

<f+2+3>

---> He does a rollling armbar move.

<f+1+4>

---> He does a Leg Lock-submission like move.

<f, F+1+2>

---> He grabs the opponent towards him followed by 2 jabs then an elbo strike then knee to the gut and lastly an axe handle to the back..nasty.

<d+1+2>

---> The tundra tackle, unlike most tackles that uses only the punch combination thing, sergei's version is (again) quite unique like:

---> <1> He does the bow and arrow backbreaker move.
---> <2> He does the falling leg lock move.
---> <1+2> He a couple of punch combination(think of bryans' 1 winning move).


<------------->
 <Strategies>
<------------->

after b+2 you can follow-up with WS moves like: WS 2, WS 1+2, WS 1, 3.

you can delay the last part of d/b+2, 1, (2) but this leaves you open most of the time.

for turtle opponent(abangis in filipino) try doing f, F+2, 1+2 it cancels the punch and it becomes a grab.

use d+3, 4 and b+4, 3 alternately to confuse most of your opponents.
