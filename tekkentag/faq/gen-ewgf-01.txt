TEKKEN TAG TOURNAMENTPlaystation 2 / Arcade THE EWGF: A BEGINNER'S GUIDE v1.0Author: Doug "scabble" BurnsideCompiled on March 25th, 2001"This document is Copyright 2001 Doug Burnside."----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Brilliant insights into the mind that is scabble's:"Should I give a ******* care what some nobody named scabble says?" -bluu----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The purpose of this FAQ:The Electric Wind God Fist is a move that does not appear in Namco's in-game command lists, yet it is an extremely important and high profile move in tournament play. Since every forum, BBS, and chat room discusses this move to death, inevitably one of the first newbie questions winds up being "What is EWGF?" In an effort to both reduce the amount of effort expended by regular posters and to minimize the embarrassment for newbie Tekken fanatics, I have made this FAQ available. ***Note: testing for this FAQ was performed on a PS2, and there may be slight deviations between the PS2 and Arcade versions.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DISCLAIMER:*This FAQ was written by Doug "scabble" Burnside and is intended for those who are trying to learn how to raise their Tekken abilities from newbie or intermediate status to the big leagues.

Kazuya Mishima does not have an EWGF. To repeat: KAZUYA MISHIMA DOES NOT HAVE AN EWGF. Please understand that this FAQ was largely intended to cover the EWGF in Tekken Tag Tournament only. (But the EWGF can also be performed by Jin Kazama in Tekken 3.)This move, and the juggles that result from it are the keystones to a strong "Mishima Style" Tekken game, as well as the #1 reason these two characters dominate the high-level tournaments worldwide. It is a right uppercut that launches your opponent for some of the most damaging juggle opportunities to be found in the game. The EWGF(electric wind god fist) is similar to the WGF (wind god fist.) Both are performed by doing f,n,d,df+2 (if you don't know what that means, it is also explained by CD+2 or f,n,d,df+rp or f,n,d,df+triangle) The f,n,d,df is a motion done with the joystick or d-pad that is called a "crouch dash." (fans of Street Fighter will also recognize this motion as Ryu's "dragon punch.") To perform a crouch dash, tap forward (toward your opponent) then allow the controller to return briefly to a neutral state, then move the controller from down to down/forward. If performed correctly and fluidly, the character will appear to duck and lunge forward. It is the diagonal down/forward input that initiates the crouch dash. Many characters in Tekken have this maneuver- Jin, Heihachi, Devil/Angel, Kazuya, Alex/Roger, and Armor King are probably the most notable examples.) This maneuver is useful for getting close to your opponent while avoiding high attacks. But its main function is to set up attacks. Many moves can be done from the crouch dash, but since this is about the EWGF, let's start there. Keep in mind the information here is for Jin and Heihachi ONLY. If the 2 (triangle, right punch) is hit during the crouch dash, the "wind god fist" (WGF) will be performed. This move is a useful launcher, but not as useful as the Electric Wind God Fist (EWGF.) Careful observation will prove that the right punch may be input at any time during the crouch dash to perform the WGF. As soon as the punch is performed, the dash stops. Practice will confirm that the earlier in the dash the right punch is hit, the faster and shorter the dash. The crucial aspect of understanding the EWGF is in two parts: 1) the diagonal down/forward motion of the controller BEGINS the crouch dash 2) the right punch (2,triangle) ENDS the crouch dash. To perform an EWGF instead of a WGF, HIT THE RIGHT PUNCH AND THE DOWN/FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME. This effectively begins and ends the crouch dash at the same time, resulting in a wind god fist with special properties- hence the "electric" WGF. This may sound simple, but it is pretty tricky, particularly for beginners. When I say that the df and the right punch need to be performed at the same time, that means you have 3 frames (a 1/20 of a second window) to nail it, otherwise you will get a "normal" WGF. For Heihachi, the EWGF window is smaller- he has a 2 frame window (1/30 of a second) to hit the EWGF. The key to a successful EWGF is hitting df+2 simultaneously. A misleading statement about the EWGF that appears in some guidebooks is that the EWGF is a WGF "done quickly." Remember that the crouch dash consists of f,N,d,df and the EWGF is initiated by the df+2. The beginning portion of the move DOES NOT have to be performed with blazing speed- so long as the df and the right punch are performed at the same instant. With practice, timing, and superb control, it is possible to hit FOUR of these in a row in a juggle (five on True Ogre.) The "greats" love to use this move to punish whiffed moves and to bulldog the opposition. For many Mishima players, the EWGF is the beginning and the end of their offense. Many players structure their entire game around this one set-up. It is a great juggle starter, it is great in the middle of juggles, and it is great to end juggles. If you want to master the Mishima style of Tekken, it is in your best interests to learn to perform the EWGF at will with Heihachi and Jin. SECTION II: EWGF PropertiesThere are notable differences between the EWGF and the WGF. The most obvious difference is that since it is an "Electric" Wind God Fist, the character will crackle with bolts of electricity EVEN ON A BLOCK OR WHIFF. A blocked EWGF will also result in a block stun that knocks the opponent back a couple steps. Since the EWGF is a launcher, you can buffer tags to allow your tag partner to finish the juggle.Jin's EWGF: Jin's EWGF has a 3 frame window to hit the df+2 (This means that the df and the right punch need to be input within 1/20 of a second of each other.) It Hits high and may be reversed or ducked (if a tag is buffered it hits special mid and cannot be reversed or ducked.) It does 25 damage, and approximately 37 damage on a counter hit (same damage as WGF.) It recovers faster than the WGF (allowing for better juggle opportunities.) Jin's EWGF will allow juggle opportunities EVEN ON A COUNTER-HIT (a CH WGF sends your opponent flying so far away that you cannot juggle, but a CH EWGF launches them straight up.) Jin's EWGF also hits with a larger range than WGF- not a 'long' range as such, but when he performs the actual move, the hit sphere around his fist is larger than the WGF, allowing you to hit juggles where the opponent is closer to the ground or slightly further away in the air.Note: Jin can also perform a "Dash Electric Wind God Fist" or DEWGF to cover more ground. The DEWGF is f,f,N,d,df+2. Heihachi's EWGF:Heihachi's EWGF has a 2 frame window to hit the df+2 (This means that the df and the right punch need to be input within 1/30 of a second of each other.) It Hits special mid and may not be reversed or ducked. It does 25 damage, and approximately 37 on a counter hit (same damage as WGF.) It recovers faster than the WGF (allowing for better juggle opportunities.) SECTION III: Wavedashing and the EWGF(courtesy of Worldmaker)WaveDashing into a WGF - (Wavedashing is chaining crouchdashes together) This, simply put, is done by merely pressing 2 at any point in your wavedash, excepting when you are pressing forward to cancel into the next CD. f~qcf~f~qcf+2 Wavedashing into an EWGF - To EWGF, A wavedash must be canceled by performing the entire EWGF motion. (That is, it can flow easily into the end of a WD, but the final motion must end at 'df', instead of a full QCF, and 2 must be pressed simultaneously.) f~qcf~f~qcf~f~qcf~f,n,d,DF+2. (Heihachi has it even harder. Since he cannot truly WEWGF, he must cancel the WD then perform the EWGF. f~qcf~f~qcf~f~qcf~f~f,n,d,df+2)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Section 4:Acknowledgements (props for peeps)1. Worldmaker for helpful tips and corrections, as well as the wavedash info. 2.  Night for additional EWGF property info3. Replicant, for providing the formatting for this FAQ that I lifted from his Tag Throw FAQ.4. Chuckster, Captain Calvert, Bri, Mer, and all the others that are scrubbier than me. I love you all because you fool me into thinking I can play this game.5. Namco, for the gift of the game to all of us.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Section 5: About the authorScabble is a grown-up with a college degree who is probably too old to play video games. This does not stop him. His favorite characters are Lei, Kazuya, Heihachi, Jack-2, Ling and Jin. He has never won any major tournaments and despite the contents of this FAQ he is a scrubby Mishima player that can't hit EWGF consistently at all. Any damage resulting from the use of this product should be treated with Band-Aids and chicken soup. This document is for amusement purposes only.
