*Legal Stuff*
Tekken Tag Tournament  and all of its products are  the sole property
of Namco. I  am stating my opinions  and my experiences here in  this
FAQ. Don't change  the contents  nor copy any of it. You may pass  it
around like a whore  if you wish  but please don't make any money off
of it.

*Updates*
I found that not all of the big character  combos  work on Kuma,  the
rest can be applied  to  all of the Jacks  and  True Ogre. I adjusted
the information in  the large  character  juggles section.  I've also
taken the liberty to adjust the aesthetics of this FAQ. It looks alot
better and it will look just as good under low resolution.

1. Introduction

2. Move Analysis

*Definitions*

Poking - Moves  that are relatively  fast  and  difficult  to  become
attack  reversed.  They are  primarily  used to iniate attack  and to
interrupt the opponent's moves. These  moves are also found in juggle
strings and may even iniate a juggle.

Rushes - Generally  a little  slower  than the poking moves  but also
important in your  offense. Rushes  are a  barrage  of attacks to get
your opponent  to react  they way  you want to.  These moves are also
found in juggle strings and may even iniate a juggle.

Power Hits - These moves  are yet  slower than  the rushes  but  have
their place in  combat  as  punishment for  missed attacks  and  slow
moves  (execution  and/or  recovery).  They are also  found in juggle
strings and sometimes juggle starters.  Sometimes power moves  are so
slow,  they can be safely executed only in certain juggle  strings or
wake up games.

Unblockables - The slowest  yet most powerful (unless you have a weak
character) move in the game. The take a long time to execute and have
a  long  recovery time.  In some cases,  you just have to be lucky to
pull one off.

Mix Ups - These  moves  are a  combination of poking  and  rushes  to
confuse your opponent into wake up games and juggle strings.

Wake Up Games -  This is  hitting your opponent on the ground, simply
speaking. The game begins when your  move that hit them and  ables to
lift them high enough where you can initiate a juggle string.

--Introduction-------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Although  big characters usually have  immense strength,  long reach,
high stamina, and difficult to juggle, their  weaknesses are the main
reason why most Tekken players overlook them.  When they are juggled,
they can receive  more  damage because  longer  combo  strings can be
executed because of their large size.  They are also  susceptible  to
wake up  games than  the regular characters,  meaning that there is a
possibility the big character can be lifted  (from the ground) into a
juggle   string.  Big  characters are  just  slow  and put  them at a
disadvantage against a faster character. The big characters that fall
into this category are  Gun Jack,  Jack 2,  P. Jack,  Kuma/Panda, and
True Ogre. Ganryu would fall under  this  category too but he doesn't
suffer any of the weakness of a  big character.  He is unusually fast
for a big character and the  only one with a  punch reversal. He  had
the tools to compete well in  high-level  play  but not to many would
choose him. Many people don't realize the real potential that  Ganryu
possess and he shouldn't be overlooked like the other big characters.
By the end of this FAQ, you should have enough information to  become
a  competitive player  and  enough reason to choose  Ganryu as one of
your reliable characters.

I try to make this FAQ lightweight by excluding unnecessary  fluff so
all you get is the meat of the Ganryu's strategies.

You  should  buy  the  Tekken Tag Tournament O fficial Perfect  Guide
because	I will be using the  terminologies from that book. This guide
is not bad because  it give  you a good idea what the s trengths  and
weakness of the characters  are.  Prima's Guide sucks,  don't buy  it
(I'm stating this only as an expression of my opinion).  The names of
the moves are used from the command list of the PS2 Tekken Tag.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
--Move Analysis------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

These  are  the moves I use  frequently  and  the other moves (that I
haven't  mentioned here) I will  mention later in the  next update to
this FAQ.

d+1(Crouch Jab) / mid / 5 / 7: It is used to interrupt the opponent's
strings, begin your own attack strings, and distance control. Because
of its speed, you would want to use this move often.
(pok | rsh | mix)

d+4(Stomp) / mid / 50 / 75: An extremely slow  but powerful  move and
not be used alone!  This may seem  like a useless  move but there are
several opportunities  where you are guaranteed a hit,  causing major
damage.
(pwr)

df+3(Kick and Pull) / low / 17 / 25: It's a great single wake up game
move  and is almost  guaranteed  after  all of the  front throws.  An
unblocked  hit will cause  a trip stun,  but there  is nothing that I
know of that Ganryu can do from that distance.
(pok | mix | wak)

df+2+3(Thunder Palm) / low / 12 / 17: It can be a  part  of  a juggle
combo or a wake up game move. Don't use this move alone often because
of its slow  speed  and can be easily  parried.  It's used best in  a
mix-up game.
(rsh | mix | wak)

df+2, 1, 1, 1(Thunder Clap) / mid-high(3) / 15-10-10-8 / 22-15-15-11:
The first hit is one of Ganryu's main attack starters because of it's
speed and  the level it  hit's at.  A hit will launch your opponent a
long distance, therefore limiting your juggle opportunities. The last
three hits I  rarely  use because the first (of three)  has some  lag
time  before  it  is executed  and your opponent  will see it time to
defend. Also they don't connect after the first hit.
(pok | rsh | mix)

ff+2,1(Jab Elbow) / high-mid / 14-12 / 20-17: It's  a  great   poking
string  and  can interrupt  the  opponent's attack strings  and  slow
moves.
(pok)

f+1+2(Sumo Rush) / mid / 28 / 41: Primarily this is used to retaliate
against slow  or lagging moves. You're in a relative safe position if
your opponent blocks because the move creates a quick guard stun long
enough for you to recover. If you miss, on the other hand,  you could
suffer great damage because of the recovery time.
(pwr)

ff+1+2(Double Step in Palm) / mid / 17 / 25:  Is  primarily  used  in
counter  attacks  and  creates  a  fall  back  stun.  Against  larger
characters, this spells rape!
(pwr)

wc+4(Crouching Right Kick) / low / 10 / 15
(pok | mix)

wc+1+2(Rising Double Palm) / low / 21 / 31:  A  good  surprise  attack
and mix up. This will roll the opponent  back some  distance  and  not
leaving with a lot of options for follow-ups.
(rsh | pwr | mix)

ws+1+2, 1+2:(Rising Double Hammer) / mid(2) / 21-17 / 31-25: This move
is used in mix-ups due to the fact that you can delay the second  hit.
The second hit will  kneel  stun the  opponent that will open up  more
opportunities for following mix-ups.
(rsh | mix)

1+2, 1+2(Double Hammer) / mid (2) / 21-22 / 31-32: The second hit  can
be delayed for mix up opportunities.  If the first hit connects,  then
the  second  hit will only be 17. The second hit by itself will launch
them but not high enough to initiate juggle strings.
(rsh | mix)

ss+1(Falling Hammer) / high / 30 / 45: Ganryu's other side  step  move
and it's is difficult  to use because  of the timing  for it.  When it
does hit,  you can execute a  df+3 for  extra  damage.  This move will
usually leave your opponent's head toward you.
(pwr | mix)

d_ss+1+2(Pedal Press) / mid / 22 / 32: The pedal press a great move to
control distance. Hit or blocked it creates a bizarre stun. If you are
behind your opponent and you execute the pedal press, it turns into an
unusual throw.  The pedal press is guaranteed (if performed correctly)
after the punch reversal (refer to the punch reversal below).
(pwr)

b,db,d,df+1(Sumo Pop) / mid / 30 / 45:  The sumo pop will launch  your
opponents  very  high  and  is taggable for some highly damaging combo
opportunities. This move does have some lagging execution  time but it
mainly used to punish  slow-recovery moves.  This  move  is also great
because  it will duck right under most high attacks giving you another
opportunity to use this move.
(pwr)

b,db,d,df+2(Strong Open Palm) / mid / 40 / 60: This move I use  rarely
only  as  a surprise  attack  or sometimes after the opponent tags in.
This move alone does quite some damage though.  On a counter hit, your
opponent will  roll  back  some distance  for  you to perform a flying
cross chop or a sliding kick.
(pwr)

b+2(Salt Upper) / mid / 15 / 22: The salt upper, like the sumo pop, an
duck under high moves. This doesn't launch as high as the sumo pop but
the juggles are still good. A plus to this move is the fact it can hit
grounded opponents but you have to be off to an angle to your opponent
to hit. Big characters can be hit any where on the ground.
(pwr | wak)

uf+3+4(Sumo Squash) / mid / 26 / 38: This move is  a very mean in wake
up games and have follow ups too.  This  will  leave you  in  the  sit
position, meaning you could start juggles and mix ups from here.
(pwr | wak)

3+4(Sit): Quick moves that ducks high attacks and provide  opportunity
for mix-ups.
(mix)

3+4~1(Sit Sweep) / low / 18 / 26: I  use this  move  a lot  to counter
high attack to go right into a juggle combo.  This can be used in wake
up games too.  If the hit is not clean then you won't go into a juggle
and the damage is reduced.
(mix | wak)

3+4~2(Sit Thrust) / mid / 27 / 40: This move  is a mix up between  sit
sweep because  the opponent may  be accustomed to the  other move  and
will be surprised by this one and get  hit by it.  This  will roll the
opponent on a counter hit.
(mix | pwr)

3+4~D(Splits): This an odd move but is get you right out of  high  and
mid attacks safely.  If you continue to hold the D,  you'll go into  a
side step.
(mix)

2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1(Sumo Juggle) / high(8) / 12-10-8-5(5) / 17-10-8-5(5):
The first  three for four I  use heavy in rushes,  in  combos  and  in
mix ups,  though  it is  rather slow but it's hard to counter once the
first hit make contact.
(rsh)

f+1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2(Open Palm Combo) / high(8) / 12-10-8-5(5) / 17-10-8-5(5):
This is similar to the sumo juggle accept for the fact that all  eight
hit will connect on a counter hit where as the first three hits of the
sumo juggle will connect.
(rsh)

b+1+2(Sumo Tackle) / ! / 90 / 135: This is Ganryu's  only  unblockable
and it's very slow.  The advantage  to this  move is  that it can duck
under high attacks and it hit very fast after the initial charge up. I
actually use this more often then most people would like and it  hit's
even in  high-level game play.  It's the timing  that  will  determine
whether or not this will hit.
(ubk)

b+1+2~2(Tackle Fake Upper) / mid / 12 / 17: You  can cancel  the  sumo
tackle to the fake upper because you know the opponent will  likely to
knock you out of the sumo tackle. The upper will cause a  crumple stun
and the stomp is guaranteed here. Major damage indeed.

--Mix Ups Strategies-----------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Rushes and the possible mix-ups that follow will be in this section
. Poking  and rushing  strategies are involved in this section too.
I'm not going to waste a lot of time explaining every detail  about
the attack strings. Just try them out and you'll see why.

Set Up 1: First two or three hit of the Sumo Juggle or Open Palm Combo
	- Thunder Palm: from here if you hit, you can go right into
	the juggle
	- Sumo Rush
	- Sumo Pop
		- Juggle Combo
	- The first hit of the thunder clap: if this  hits,  it's a
	free juggle
	- Crouching Right Kick
	- Kick and Pull

Set Up 2: Sit to avoid the high attacks
	- Sit Sweep: may lead in to a juggle.
	- Sit thrust:  your  opponent my get accustomed  to the sit
	sweep and you could use a single damaging attack
	- Splits:  the splits will avoid high and mid attack,  hold
	the D and the SS again, this will place you in an
	advantageous position and ready for SS moves
		- Falling Hammer: if it hits, you have the Kick and
	Pull ready for you.
		- Pedal Press

Set Up 3: Crouching Jab
	- Rising Double Hammer:  the delay of the second hit should
	be varied to confuse your opponent. Sometimes you  want  to 
	complete the  move at full  speed  or slow it down for more
	possible damage.
		- Any where in Set Up 1
	- Rising Double Palm
	- Crouching Right Kick


-------------------------------------------------------------------
--Some Advice------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. In order to beat the other characters, you should read up on the
other character's FAQS to give you an idea how to beat them.

2. Learn another character completely different from Ganryu just in
case  someone  know how to beat Ganryu well and you have a  back up
character  that should  give  them  plenty to work with.  There are
three other  characters that I  recommend.  First is Michelle,  for
some reason Ganryu has  a thing with her.  Her speed  and  juggling
abilities complements well with  Ganryu.  Second is Bruce,  because
they both are  bodyguards  in the  Tekken story,  why not?  Bruce's
strong  mix-up abilities  and  very  damaging  (and cheap) juggling
abilities  make  them very deadly.  Finally,  Ogre  anther  "large"
character  but  does  not  suffer  any of  the negative traits like
Ganryu.  Ogre has a wide variety of moves ranging from unblockables
to  wake up games to speed up the kill with Ganryu. Since Ogre also
has  a high stamina,  like Ganryu,  it will take a lot to take them
both out.

3. Get your assed kick hard by somebody  really  good.  If you keep
playing people you can easily beat, there's no point in playing and
you won't learn anything.

4. Study frame rates.  By studying  frame rates,  you can determine
which moves you have that are suited against with the moves of your
opponents.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
--Conclusion-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This  FAQ this  should be enough to improve your skills with Ganryu
or  have  a  good solid foundation  if starting  with him.  I  will
eventually make a Heavy-Weight Version of this FAQ along with other
Ganryu players.  I'll probably  make one complete with pictures and
full motion videos  to  make  the  learning  experience sweet. This
guide  will take an amateur player right into an expert in no time.
