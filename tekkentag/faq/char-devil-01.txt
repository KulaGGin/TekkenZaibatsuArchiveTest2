Devil/Angel Guide for Tekken Tag v.2.5
by KaNE (I am NOT the same guy as Kane_C)
Started 11/25

NOTE: BEST VIEWED WITH INTERNET EXPLORER @ 800x600!!!

Version 1.0-woot! first attempt at any guide ever.
Revision 1.0-1.1-corrected few minor errors, added info and some reformatting. Now works with
		Winword. Updated 11/27
Revision 1.1-1.2-corrected few minor errors, added info, more reformatting. Updated 11/28
Revision 1.2-1.25-added lots info.
Revision 1.25-1.5-added lots info with reformatting.
Revision 1.5-1.777b-ahh...revised strength's weaknesses section, seeing that I did not finish
		writing it when I sent out version 1.5. There is now an A,B and C version of this
		document, for I cannot make it work with both WordPad and Microsoft Word at the
		same time. (mainly in the moves explanation section). Version A is for Wordpad, B
		for Microsoft Word and version C is for Microsoft Word. Again, reformatting and
		info added. This is version C, Text version.
Revision 1.777b-1.9-added stuff about universal moves.
Revision 1.9-2.0-added some info, changed stuff. Actually changed the version # on the top
		(whereas I forgot to with every update) 1/05/2000
Revision 2.0-2.1-added more info, stuff. 1/06/2000
Revision 2.1-2.2-added lots info, much reformatting. Looked like crap in the previous version
		when used in Internet Explorer and Netscape, so I reformatted everything.
		1/10/2000
Revision 2.2-2.5-added 10 hit combo. Why didn't I include this? Cuz I don't use it and
		personally I think it is useless. I also renumbered the guide because I screwed up
		on the numbering with my last update. I also expanded the explainations and added a
		stragety section. I've also kinda abandoned the idea of a Wordpad
		and Microsoft Word guide since I don't want to added all the new info with much
		reformatting to do with them.
Revision 2.5-3.0-well I changed a whole crapload of stuff. Nothing really made sense before, so
		I changed all that. The "vulnerbilities" have been taken out. If you want to know
		about the vulnerbilites...READ THE FRAME DATA!! Heh...it's been too long since the
		last update, anyway... I also changed the table of contents which made NO sense in
		the previous version...it seems that I had two section 13's...damn...I changed like
		almost everything...



Please do not use this in Wordpad/Microsoft Word for it will look like crap.

Note: sorry I am not a master of ascii art. I cannot make what others can for the titles. This
	guide is best used with Winword and is a comprehensive Devil/Angel guide. I prefer Angel
	because she is a sight for sore eyes. They are actually the same charcter, just different
	polygons and texels. To pick Angel, just goto Devil and press the Start button (if you
	didn't know and couldn't figure it out.).

1)Bio- Not much is known about Angel except that she seemingly accompanies Devil (ironic, eh?).
	It seems that way because of Tekken 2's intro movie. I do not know the full story behind
	them both, but someone out there might.
	
	Devil is said to be Kazuya, but transformed. One thing that leaves me dumbfounded is if
	Devil is Kazuya, why doesn't he have the same moves? In Tekken Tag, there is more of a
	distinction between Devil and Kazuya, being their new moves.
	
	Both Angel and Devil seem to have a mysterious jewel on their forehead which emits a
	laser, one of the cheapest moves in the game. When Angel/Devil fly into the air (or stay
	on the ground) and shoot their laser, it goes very fast. In Tekken 2, sidestepping had
	not yet been included into the game, so it was extremely cheap. You could either back up,
	or dash forward and be rewarded with performing a back throw. However, in Tekken Tag,
	you could easily sidestep the flying laser and be rewarded with a side-throw.
		

2)Angel/Devil's Strengths and Weaknesses-it is said that Devil is better because he is dark and
	you cannot see his moves as easily. I find that not true in some cases such as for King's
	TTT stage. It is very bright and in that case, Angel would be better. Angel does not have
	many vulnerable points except for when she uses her laser attacks and her devil fist. Her
	Devil Twister (ss+2) is very powerful and can set up some really crazy and devastating
	juggles. Her Wind God Fist is a VERY useful thing to learn.

	Also, Devil does not have the Netsu powerup that Angel has. I have heard that the reason
	she doesn't is because Devil could care less about his tag partner. Netsu is actually
	when one of your players gets hit (I believe approximately 5 times), then their partner
	becomes angry, or gets the Netsu powerup. I have heard that Devil does not care enough
	about his partner to become angry at the other person.

	Seeing that Angel is not perfect, she does have some flaws. Her Devil Twister is very
	powerful, but has a dangerous lag if an opponent blocks it. Another thing that has a huge
	lag is her Devil Fist. Angel is not a very strong person, but she does have nice juggles
	which compensates for her strength. Also, she does not have many low-hitting moves which
	can become irritating to someone who always blocks high (so you pull off some dual
	hellsweeps).



3) Tekken System- The Tekken Tag system is different than all the other systems. Most of the
	characters have around 141~155 damage points. In Tekken 3, every character had 130 and
	in Tekken 2, every character had 100. In Tekken Tag, the smaller characters have less
	hit total damage points than the larger characters. I am uncertain of the exact numbers,
	but it is said that the difference between the huge characters and the smaller characters
	is around 30 damage points. But there are 4 classes of damage which characters are divided
	into. Angel and Devil are in the highest damage class with 170 points of damage.
	On most juggle launchers, you can tech roll out. Angel/Devil has one where you cannot.
	It is ss+2, which hits your opponent very high and spinning. The spinning part will not
	actually have the person spin, but will act as a normal juggle. There are sweeps where
	you cannot tech roll out. Some of them are from the following: Lei's sweep (d/b+4),
	Julia's skyscraper kick (ws+4) and Armor King's low exploder (d/b+4).
	After your first player has been hit a lot, when you tag, your partner's life (around
	the border) will be flashing red. The red indicates that that person is up to 40%
	stronger. If you nail that person will a heavy combo or heavy hit (while flashing red),
	you are going to see some nice results. Note: Devil does not have this powerup. It is
	also known as the Netsu powerup.

6) Moves Explanation-based on a 5 star system. 5=the best, 3=average, and 1=don't use it.

	Name			Rating	Notes

	1,2 punches-		***	Good for poking people. Why don't you just 2 again while
					you're at it? This move is pretty self explanatory.
	Backhand spinner-	*	this is gay unless your left punch button somehow doesn't
					work. Angel punches you with her right hand, then gives
					you a spinning backhand. The damage is not so hot and it
					does leave you in trouble if the opponent ducks it (ie.
					leaving you open for a juggle)
	Flashpunch Combo-	***	this move is good for nailing people that hasn't
					recovered from a v1. Angel punches you with her left,
					left again and hits you hard with her right hand.
					Good priority. It is also good for a poking type move.
	Demon Rush-		***	basically the same thing as the flashpunch combo, except
					it takes off 2 more damage points.
	Demon Slayer-		**	similar to the Backhand Spinner, except she gives you a 
					left jab first. Good priority, but it hits all high, so
					use this with discretion. Again, a person can duck and
					hammer you with a juggle.
	Wind God Fist-		*****	alright, here's one of Angel's best moves. She basically
					gives you a powerful uppercut which juggles. It's fast
					and can usually avoid high hits if you delay (because of the
					crouch dash). This move also has one of the best priorities,
					which is good when you are engaged in an offensive
					battle. On a CH, the opponent does a back flip, which can
					interfere with a damaging juggle you might have otherwise
					performed. You can delay this move, making others think
					you are going for some hellsweeps, but this proves
					ineffective because it now has the properties of special
					mid.
	Thunder God Fist-	***	a nice move because she drops so low before upper-cutting.
					It is basically a leaping uppercut. Similar to the 
					shoryuken that we've all seen except without the 
					invincibility and the 2 story leap. Good damage, but the
					priority is crap because of the slow delay. This move is
					not nearly as strong as Heihachi, Jin or Kazuya's Dragon
					Uppercut, even though it should be because Angel and
					Devil are supernatural. However, you have more than a 10 frame
					recovery time, so you might watch out when playing someone,
					for they could give you a 1,1,2 or perhaps a hopkick.
	TGF to mid kick-	****	useful for confusing players. But, since all the Mishimas
					except Heihachi has it, it is fairly easy to block.
	TGF to sweep-		**	again, useful for confusing scrubs. The sweep is a bit
					slow coming out, so I believe it is possible to nail the
					Angel with a jab and juggle them.
	Heaven's Gate-		****	a nice move for extra damage. The second part to this move
					is actually a throw, but it cannot be escaped. This is a
					new move for Angel and Devil, which can be quite
					irritating to some. What Angel does is she nails you with
					a Dragon Uppercut, then flys into the air (off the
					screen), grabbing you, then after a short moment, slams
					you onto the ground. Note that this only works on a clean hit.
	Crouch Dash-		*****	yea. This is the move that pisses people off when you
					delay a WGF. During a crouch dash, you can do another
					one, which is better and faster than regular dashing. This move
					is also abbreviated as CD. You can do ws moves from the CD by
					doing this: f,n,d,df~b(button). You can can cancel the CD motion
					by doing: f,n,d,df~f. 
	Wave Dash-		*****	ok, this is a move where a crouch dash continuously cancels into
					another. Very useful for confusing tactics.
	Light Dash-		*****	essentially the same as a wavedash, except you are doing more
					than 4 waves per second.
	Hellsweep(dual)-	****	this move is very confusing because people normally think
					you are going to give them a WGF, but hellsweep instead.
					This version is better than Heihachi's because Heihachi's
					doesn't trip you on the first one (if you are guarding
					high), but Angel's does. Well, so does Jin. And Kazuya.
					But, Jin, Kazuya and Angel/Devil don't have a Dragon
					Uppercut link to their hellsweep.
	Hellaxe Kicks-		***	useful with low turtlers. It is strong and can also be
					used in a juggle. (ie WGF,d+2,ws+4,4). It's basically a
					right splits kick that hits twice.
	Rising Sun-		*	ok, everyone knows how to block this, so this move now
					sucks. Your best chance is to nail the guy while he's
					doing a move. A person can duck the first and nail you
					with a move (ie. nail you with a Dragon Uppercut if they
					anticipate it). Angel/Devil basically does 2 hellsweeps
					except the first one is a leaping hellsweep.
	Twin Pistons-		****	VERY useful, but it doesn't juggle heavy opponents like T
					Ogre, Ganryu, the bears and the Jacks. It does juggle and
					can hit a person out of a v1.
	Devil Fist-		*	useful, but it has to be a clean hit. The range also sucks.
					Can get nail them with a right kick after connecting.
					What happens is that Angel/Devil hits you and 'slides' in
					back of you. There are some hits you can connect after
					this move, too. It is also not to be used in a juggle, for
					it will not hit the opponent.
	Demon Scissors-		***	In my opinion, this move is pretty useless unless
					used right after a juggle. You can also use this move for
					people who like to stay on the floor (ie. Lei w/ his play
					dead moves)
	Left Splits Kick-	**	good countering move and decent damage. This is not such
					a regular move, though. It does almost as much damage as
					a Dragon Uppercut when not a clean hit.
	Right Splits Kick-	***	this is not exactly the most useful move in the game. You
					should only use this against ducking opponents. It DOES
					have some potential, but try not to incorporate this into
					your style of playing. It also has decent damage-more
					than the left splits kick and the non-clean hit Dragon
					Uppercut. This move also breaks the opponent's guard.
	Devil Twister-		*****	the other one of Angel's most USEFUL moves. Hits the
					opponent incredibly high up and it is a sidestep move,
					which is good if the other player misses an attack. The
					only disadvantage is that the priority is not so great and there
					is a HUGE opening for an attack if the opponent blocks.
	Heavy Side Kick-	***	useful for nailing opponents who are trying to tag out.
					Douzono also uses this move frequently and in repetition.
	Uppercut-		****	does not juggle heavy opponents, but useful for countering
					attacks, which juggles an opponent. Good for poking.
	Laser Attacks-		**	try not to use these too much. These are what give Angel
					and Devil a bad name. If you have to use this, just use it
					in a combo.

	#1-can alternate punches (2,1,2,1,2,1)
	#2-while being hit hard (ie. deathfist, Jin's ff+2)



9) Poking- Poking is more or less countering, but not the countering with b+2+4_b+1+3. It is
		when someone (ie Eddy) is doing a move (ie flare) and you perform a quick move
		(ie a Wind God Fist). If you were King and Lei was going into a stance, you
		might perform a Disgraceful Kick (b+4). In this Angel/Devil's case, you would do
		something like a Flash Punch Combo or a Left Splits Kick to stun them. To poke an
		opponent, you would have to perform your move while/slightly before they perform
		theirs, but your's, having more priority, would nail them.
		Poking is not exceedingly difficult, but might take some time if you are a novice.
		The best time to practice poking moves are on button smashers (no offense to
		them.).  Some moves are more difficult to poke than others. For example, it is not
		easy to poke someone who is doing an Wind God Fist or Dragon Uppercut.

		Poking is a very good tactic. If you nail a person while they are doing something,
		then you will probably get a CH hit and drain much life from them.

10) Chickening- The concept of chickening is quite simple, but can be tedious, for it is more
		of an anticipation. Chickening is basically reversing a counter. When someone
		like Paul, Nina or Jin counters you, you can reverse their counter. Note: you
		cannot chicken King's counters. Anyway, if you perform a move with a right
		button (kick/punch), then you have to press f+2+4 the SECOND they counter
		your move. If you perform a move with a left button (kick/punch), then you
		have to press f+1+3 the SECOND they counter your move. It is my theory that
		if you use both punches or kicks, then you could use either one.

		Chickening is good if you are fighting a player who abuses the ability to counter
		hits. It is not a difficult concept to learn, just requires a fast hand and
		considerable anticipation. Chickening does not provide the high-class damage a
		counter provides, but it does prevent you from losing too much life.
	
		Also, you cannot chicken Heihachi's right leg reversal.

11) Juggles- here we get to the good stuff. The Juggles.

12) Low Parry- Low parrying is a simple concept, but can backfire if not performed correctly.
		To perform a low parry, you have to press d/f an instant before a low attack.
		Everyone can use a low parry. Some did have low parries in Tekken 3 and 
		now carry the same motion for it in TTT. Some of those people include Law,
		Julia, Bryan, Xiaoyu and King. To do low parries with those people, press
		d/b+(1+3_2+4), except for Xiaoyu which is d/b+1+4 and King which is d/b+2+3.
		Those low parries do not differ from the d/f ones, just different motions. You
		can low parry almost anything, including slides, ali kicks and sweeps. You can
		even low parry a tag-in slide!

13) Miscellaneous-Angel cannot be chosen with Kazuya in the arcade version...lest she
			automatically be replaced with Devil. I think that's all...


14) Legal Stuff-All the characters in this guide were created by Namco. I don't actually think
			I need this in here, but....eh.

15) Strategy: basically, the wgf is your friend most of the time. It is quick and has pretty
			good recovery. Not to mention it also hits special mid. 1,1,2 would be your
			poking friend. You should use it a lot while poking a person. Realize that I
			did not say ABUSE the 1,1,2 or wgf (heh...thought I do anyway...). You should
			learn how to wave/light dash if you don't already know how. It's very useful.

		Offensive: Tet has nothing to do with this. Ehh...yeah. Anyway, you should dish
			out some major damage with wgf. But DO NOT have a repetitive style (like I
			do), otherwise you will become too predictable, as I probably am. Some people
			are soo predictable, you can judge what they are going to do next. Paul scrubs
			are just waiting for you to do something wrong and bust out a deathfist. You
			should be able to successfully mixup between hellsweeps, wgf and twin pistons.
			The twin pistons are the next best thing to the wgf. Some say that it is even
			better because it hits mid and once the 1st hit connects, the second is
			guaranteed. If you are constantly mixing up moves and it just isn't hitting
			them because they are turtling, then you should throw them around several
			times...make them go after you. Chances are they will...then you can pop them
			up with a launcher and finish with your favorite juggle.

		Defensive: so you like to turtle, eh??... well MAKE SURE you know how to block. And
			how to backdash. Back dashing is extremely important. You can backdash out of
			a lot of moves in the game, therefore giving you an advantage if someone likes
			to pitbull (an in-your-face tactic). It gives you an advantage because if they
			miss an attack, then you will have plenty of time to attack them back. It is
			good to make sure you have a quick wgf speed...because 1,1,2 will not hit them
			for all the hits if you are far away...and neither will the twin pistons.
			Again, blocking is the most thing to know. Whether you have to block up or
			down is extremely important, otherwise good players will exploit your
			weaknesses and you will be screwed.

16) The uh...10 hit combo: wtf? I don't even use this! I believe it is useless and some
	good players already know how to block this. (except SPMAN who recently got hit by ALL 10
	hits of someone's 10 hit...he could've at least blocked ONE of the hits, but....eh)

	Anyway, the 10 hit goes like this:

	Buttons				Range				Damage

	f,f,2,1,2,2,3,4,4,1,2,1		h,h,h,h,m,m,l,h,m,m		7,8,6,7,6,11,5,5,8,30
