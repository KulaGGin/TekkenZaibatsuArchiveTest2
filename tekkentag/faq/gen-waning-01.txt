{ 1 } I n t r o d u c t i o n

      This mini-faq is designed to share my knowledge of one of the most
      potent moves in all of Tekken Tag Tournament (and probably in any
      Tekken game, period); The Waning Moon throw.  Only 3 characters have
      this move: Wang, Ogre and True Ogre.  This throw has a complex motion,
      but it is the same motion for all three characters ALMOST.  Please
      read the Move Execution Tips to see differences between the three as
      far as execution is concerned.  The motion for this throw is: tap the
      down forward diagonal twice in succession (and you've got to be
      accurate), then hit both the right punch and right kick buttons at the
      same time.  The character with the Waning Moon will then procede to
      grab the opponent, spin behind their back, and hit them with both
      elbows in the back.  The opponent will then stagger away from the
      Waning Moon character, stunned and dropped to their knees.  During
      this time where the opponent still has their back turned and is
      recovering, you have initiative to attack their unguarded back for a
      slight moment. If you did the throw with Wang, he can immediately
      tag to his partner, and they can execute a follow up instead of
      Wang.  Wang's partner will come in to the stunned character's front
      side, and will have the initiative to attack.

      As you can probably tell, this FAQ is an in-depth FAQ on only ONE MOVE
      for these characters.  This FAQ is only meant for intermediate
      to high level play.  Please don't waste your time reading this FAQ if
      you aren't serious about learning this move;  Someone could literally
      spend a week mastering the execution ALONE.

      The Waning Moon is a difficult move to use, but that doesn't come
      without it's strong points:  The Waning Moon throw can lead to the
      most potent combos in the game, hands down.  Imagine being able to do
      nearly 100 points of damage in one combo, completely turning a losing
      round in your favor...seems unfair doesn't it?  Like I said before, the
      move is extremely hard to execute, and this is how I can justify using
      the Waning Moon to it's full potential.  To put it bluntly:  If a Paul
      scrub can get lucky and hit me with a counter hit deathfist, I am
      losing 60+ points of life with that one move...and Paul's deathfist
      is only a quarter circle motion and one button.  If he can get 60+
      points with that much ease, what's wrong with doing a motion easily 
      more than twice as difficult to get 100 points of damage?  Trust me,
      once you get the motion down and are able to set it up properly,
      you'll be just dying to take advantage of the damage you can inflict;
      and you'll be doing it without mercy or remorse because you spent the
      time to learn this most difficult move.  (Evil laugh...)

        Note: You'll find my conventions very close to those of
        Tekken.Net...I'm already used to them, and they are pretty
        much accepted to be a standard in the Tekken community.

{ 3 } M o v e   E x e c u t i o n   T i p s

      General: This is the Golden Rule of an aspiring (or already a master)
      "Waning Mooner":  Know thy joysticks.  Unless the competition comes
      home to you (ahem, Sauer...), you're going to have to adjust to the
      diagonals and feel (looseness/tightness) of the sticks everywhere
      you play.  This might mean buying 2 games worth of tokens and playing
      Wang/Ogre on both sides of the machine so you can get used to the
      sticks' feel and practice the motion...it might mean doing this 10
      times a day for the next week.  Just don't get discouraged.  And for
      Pete's sake (sorry, I had to say it), don't go into a tournament
      expecting to pull a Waning Moon comeback if you haven't scoped out
      the sticks and fully adjusted to them beforehand.  Back in the good Ol'
      days of Tekken1, the Waning Moon was simple 2+4 throw - I would love to
      have that back!

      I personally find the double d/f tap easiest to execute on Happ's
      "Ultimate Joystick," since the stick's shaft is thinner than others.
      It allows for more precise diagonal movement.  The downside that many
      compain about is that the joystcks seem "jumpy" and will oftentimes
      hop in the middle of movement or crouch dash.  I remedy this by sitting
      in a stool in front of the game.  This accomplishes several things:
      First, it rests my legs.  Secondly, I more easily can align
      myself with the center of the stick so I don't get "jumpy" unless I
      start to loose my concentration and so I feel the d/f (and other)
      diagonals much easier.  If only American arcades would install the
      Japanese style "ball" sticks...they are super accurate with precision
      diagaonl movements, and it is also easier to tap directionals faster,
      which is useful in performing "Crazy Legs" and other fancy footwork.
      I guess we Americans are too rough on the sticks; even the Happ sticks
      tend to bend at the shaft under rough play.  There have been times
      where I have replaced a joystick on our TTT machine where
      I work after as little as 4 days, because the mashers decided to
      have a competition or something and the shaft is bent.  Don't even
      think about getting the Japanese style sticks for a long time; they are
      even more fragile than the Happ sticks.
            
      A) For Wang:  Wang's execution of the Waning Moon is actually harder
         than Ogre's (slightly).  It seems that Wang must be more accurate
         with his taps, and also slightly faster.  You can try button
         buffering the 2+4 part (hold 2 or 4, do the d/f, d/f taps, then hit
         the other button while still holding the first), but I would
         recommend against it because you will get either a ss+4, d/f+2
         or d/f+4 if you aren't 100% accurate.  Wang's Waning Moon is going
         to take more time than Ogre's to learn; I would recommend learning
         Wang's first -- Ogre's will come out that much easier.  To be
         consistent is the goal; when you are, you will be feared because of
         it.  The escape for the throw is a dual button escape: 1+2.
         However, the escape must be input within 12 frames (about 1/10 of a
         second) from the time the opponent was grabbed.  That means that not
         many except "Crazy Fingers" himself should be escaping your Waning
         Moon on reaction... it would have to be anicipated.  That leads me
         to the next point on landing a Waning Moon...DON'T BECOME
         PREDICTABLE WITH IT'S USE.  You'll be doing other Wang users and
         myself a great disservice by conditioning the opposition to be
         ready for it.  After a f+1 counter hit, go for a hopkick or a f+4
         if you landed a Waning Moon the previous round with the same set up.
         Don't make the Waning Moon your only counter for a missed move;
         if the opponent escapes your Waning Moon, you've overused that
         set up that preceded the escape.

         If you can't get it at first, you might try doing why do every now
         and then...find a time at the arcade where you won't be challenged,
         then set up a stool and bring some rubber bands.  What I usually do
         is play on the second player side (my d/f taps are less accurate on
         this side), and take a rubber band and force the player one stick
         into a back (left) position.  Make sure that it is all the way in
         the left position, then pick your team (Wang and any character whose
         follow ups you want to verify/practice), and then pick Nina and Anna
         for the opposite player side.  Round 1...Nina/Anna will start
         walking back.  Dash up in their face and throw a basic jab (1).
         Now quickly go for a Waning Moon Throw.  If you messed it up, (and
         didn't button buffer the button presses), Wang will try to grab with
         a normal 2+4 throw.  How can you tell the difference?  Wang's hands
         grab out the same length when you nail a Waning Moon, but if you
         miss, his right arm will grab farther, and you (Wang) will end up
         missing Nina/Anna with the normal 2+4 throw.  If you did get the
         Waning Moon, the slight range increase (due to both arms being
         extended) will have enough range to grab them, even with the 1p
         joystick walking back for you automatically.  Nina/Anna walk back
         at the right pace for this to work, so I always use this to practice
         my Waning Moon.  Another thing that you can use my little training
         set up for is to practice tag follow ups; since the joystick will
         be held in a blocking position (left) if you tag, you can verify if
         your follow up would be blockable had you pulled the Waning Moon in
         match play, since Wang's teammate will come out from the right
         side.
         
      B) For Ogre and True Ogre:  As long as you take my advice and learn
         to use Wang's Waning Moon first, I shouldn't even need to put in
         this section.  The Ogre's can be slightly slower and less accurate
         than Wang and still get the Waning Moon to come out.  I feel this
         was done on purpose;  you can't tag Ogre's Waning Moon to another
         character, and his follow ups tend to be less damaging than Wang's.
         There is one more difference between Wang's and the Ogre's Waning
         Moon throws:  The Ogre's Waning Moon CANNOT BE ESCAPED!  That means
         as soon as you make contact with the throw, it's bedtime for the
         opponent.


{ 4 } M o v e   S e t   U p s

      General:  Ok, if you've got this far in my FAQ, you've already got the
      motion down (or you're planning on having it down), so now the
      move needs to be set up properly.  There are several instances where
      Wang and the Ogre's can (and should) pull out a Waning Moon that are
      shared:

      1) The most common:  After a basic jab (1_f+1) counterhit. The opponent
         has very little time to duck, and most likely won't be able to throw
         out a counter to the Waning Moon before it comes out.

      2) Another (uncommon against good competition):  After a missed,
         slow recovering move.  You just blocked the elbow portion of Paul's
         d+4,2 falling leaf?  Great, punish him for it!

      3) As the opponent quick recovers:  If you can anticipate a quick
         recover get up from the opponent, a Waning Moon is usually a safe
         bet.  I like this set up combo for Wang:  u/f+4 (or any other juggle
         starter), D+2, d/f+3,4...then: if they quick recover, Waning Moon...
         if they don't quick recover a d/b+4,2 will hit them as the hit the
         ground.

      4) After a d/f low parry: This set up is pretty effective; I smiled to
         myself when I realized the potential of this setup.  The opponent
         doesn't have much time to react unless you get predictable in this
         set up, so keep it fresh please.  Wang will have to take a half step
         in to Waning Moon after a d/f low parry, since his arms aren't as
         long as the Ogre's, but the Ogre's (True Ogre's especially) has some
         range to it.  You might want to stick in the the half step forward
         even if you are Ogre, just to make sure you are in range.  This is
         your ultimate revenge against people that constantly assault your
         legs to annoy you: Heihachi hell sweepers, Laws that use the
         Junkyard kick, Jun's annoying sweeps, Lee's infernal D+4,4,4,4 combo,
         Jack's d/b+1 and all the others you can think of...now imagine that
         anticipated low attack = 70+ points of damage to your opponent.
         (Evil laugh...)

      A) For Wang:  

         1) Wang's Specialty: Crouch dash into Waning Moon throw.  This is
            really hard to get consistently, but it's also very effective.
            Don't use the Waning Moon all the time out of a crouch dash, mix
            it up with a delayed deathfist or a f+4 to keep them honest.

         2) After you've forced the opponent to block a move that induces
            guard stun such as ss+1+2 (you'll need to step in to hit it, but
            if you cround dash in it'll be more effective) or flying cross
            chop (while running f+1+2 or tagging in to Wang, then f,f,n+1+2).

      B) For Ogre and True Ogre:

         1) After the 1,1 chain attack:  This is fairly effective, even more
            so if the 1,1 chain hits the opponent.  For some reason even
            good players fall asleep after being hit witht he 1,1 chain.  I
            am sure this is due to the monotinous 1,1,2 attack that lots of
            Jin and Hei players love to use for a quick, easy counter and
            knockdown.  Test your opponent on this once; if he evades the
            Waning Moon the first time, chances are he'll be more than ready
            with a counter the second time.

         2) After the d/f+1 elbow:  This is the "HAN special" that I devised
            a couple of years ago with Ogre in Tekken 3 that still works like
            a charm in TTT, especially if the d/f+1 counterhits.  Please,
            keep this set-up fresh and only call it out in desperate need;
            if you use more than 2 or 3 times in one game against someone,
            they'll eventually wise up.  That means using the d/f+1,2 string
            a good amount before you want to hit the Waning Moon, and
            switch it it to a hop kick after a d/f+1 to keep them honest
            every now and then.

         3) After a ws+2 stun:  Unless they Tag escape the ws+2 stun, the
            Waning Moon will hit, since the throw itself is inescapable.

         4) After a blocked slash kick (while running 3, or f,f,f+3 a couple
            steps away from the opponent).

         5) After a blocked u/f+3,4 (2/3 hunting hawk) or f,f+4 (bazooka leg).

      Feel free to devise your own set ups, and send them this way
      (PHahn123@aol.com) if they are particularly useful.  Of course I'll
      give you credit!

        The sites that have helped me in writing this FAQ:


        www.fighters.net  great site for all you fighting game fanatics
                          like myself.

        www.gamefaqs.com  for all of my FAQ needs.

        www.tekken.net   great site for many reasons, (forum, frame data,
                         combos, ect)...but I must admit, those combo
                         exhibtions rock.  Thanks guys!

        www.tekkentagtournament.com   nice forum set-up and some move
                                      information was taken from this
                                      site for official move names and
                                      damages.

        I would also like to thank all those at Namco that made the TTT
        tournies run so well.  While the midwest regionals could have been
        better with more machines, I think that Namco did the best they
        could, given the circumstances.  Namco also deserves another round
        of applause for creating one of the most fun, addictive, and
        strategy-oriented games ever made!
