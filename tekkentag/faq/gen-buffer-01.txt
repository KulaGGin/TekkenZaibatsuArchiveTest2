FOREWORD

This started as version 1.1 of my first attempt at contributing 
a FAQ to the Tekken database at large.  I didn't list a table of 
contents, rather simply shared my findings as they applied to the 
subject of this guide, hence the somewhat unstructured form. I 
would like to at least once here refer to it as "The Art of the 
Buffer" or perhaps "Buffer your Way to Glory" or something equally 
pretentious. Seriously, we've all read somewhere that at the 
highest levels of Tekken play, buffering plays a major role 
(and not just to chicken).  It is one thing to be told of doors 
to higher levels, another to be given the keys.  Has everyone 
understood what buffering suggests and how it works?  If so, 
you probably don't need this guide.  Let it be for average 
players, and for those who are interested in attaining these 
"higher levels".



CONVENTIONS

I'll assume everyone reading this is a Tekken 3 or TTT player 
who is in no need of an explanation of the accepted conventions 
used in Tekken FAQs.  But one convention used in this FAQ must 
be introduced: bracketed buttons (with or without directional 
inputs) for example [2], must be held until the inputting of the 
complete command is finished.  Likewise, F+[1] (using a capital 
letter for the directional command) means both f and 1 must be held.



INTRODUCTION

Perhaps buffering, at least intentionally, is not something 
the average player has had much time to think about.  It's 
simple: "Buffering" is the art of pre-inputting commands or 
"parts" of commands, and then finishing them subsequently.  
What this means is:  1) buffering applies to multi-button 
commands (with directional commands, buffering applies to 
adjacent or subsequent commands rather than to simultaneous 
ones).  2) some difficult command inputs can be simplified 
and execution times improved.  3) moves can be chained 
together.  4) whereas a 2 button command (ex. 1+2) produces 
1 "technique" (Lei's hook-punch, recovers BK), a buffered 
version [1], 2, will produce 2 techniques (jab followed by 
hook-punch, BK).  5) many buffered combos can be started 
either left or right.  6) all the quick taps (4~3) are in 
reality buffers.  7) superb mix-ups can be created.

Until tekken Tag is available on PSX2 next year, I won't be 
able to study buffering techniques for all characters concerned 
(as I wasn't previously a Tekken 2 player) and so will confine 
my "move lists" of buffering possibilities to those characters 
I know and love best.  Version 1. will focus on Lei and Paul - 
my second favorite, Hwoarang, won't be appearing in this version 
because as defined in point  1) above, buffering only applies to 
multi-button commands.  Sadly, from a bufferer's point of view, 
"Bob" is lacking (but hey, he doesn't have a reversal either) 
in multi-button commands.  He does however have a couple of 
buffered combo throws that are dynamite!  If you really want 
to get into buffering though, be sure to choose a character 
rich in multi-button commands.  Later versions of this FAQ will 
look at Xiaoyu, Law, Hwoarang, Julia, Jin, Nina and Anna.

I'll try to evaluate the potential of each "combo" in terms 
of its strategic and/or tactical use in real play as I go along.



CHICKENS

Everybody knows by now, or should know by now, what a Chicken 
is and how to buffer one.  A "Chicken" is for those who fear 
or respect reversals or those who are just too cool to be 
caught pants down.  In effect we reverse the reversal -
Kaeshiwaza in Aikido.  Even Namco told us how to do it: if 
you punch left or kick left, 1 or 3, you must immediately 
input (buffer) f+1+3 afterward to have a Chicken buffered 
in the CPUs short term memory "in case" a reversal appears. 
This is certainly possible but difficult to do: after every 
move that could conceivably be reversed, we have to additionally 
punch-in f+1+3 or f+2+4.  It's easier to risk it - after all, 
only Paul, Nina, Jin, and Anna have reversals for both punches 
and kicks!  But I would argue this is not truly "Buffering a 
Chicken" rather simply inputting one.  Buffering means to 
pre-input parts of commands then finish them subsequently.  
This is "buffering" a Chicken:

[3], f+1    Easier and faster
F+[4], 2
f,F+[3], 1 
b+[2], f+4
d, df+[2], f+4
uf+[4], f+2

There's a "catch" here that has maybe already raised a 
question in the minds of those who are in the habit of 
being one step ahead: Won't [3], f+1 or F+[4], 2 produce 
a throw attempt?  Yes.  Now here's the catch: If we input 
f+1 before our previous command [3] recovers, it is a 
buffered Chicken.  If we input after the recovery 
(which is pretty fast with a jab) it's going to be a 
throw attempt. DON'T FORGET!  Alternatively, we could 
also input as shown above: f+[4], f+2 As we can see 
this applies to virtually every move with less than 3 
buttons simultaneously.  Rather than risking it, show 
'em who's boss.  But of course the choice is yours to 
Buffer or Suffer.

 

THROWS

Every character, rich in multi-button or multi-directional 
commands or not, shares this in common: the ability to 
buffer the normal throws and some special throws.  However 
Namco did not create all souls equal, and not all 
characters have the same number of throws - nor do 
all special throws require two buttons.

Call it basic buffering and keep these points in mind 
when applying your own buffers:

Jab [1] or [2] followed by kick, 3 or 4 = throw 1+3 or 2+4.  
Can we do this the other way around, kick first?  Sure.  
The only problem is, a kick may knock your opponent too 
far away to reach with your grab.  It depends on your 
character's attributes of course as well as those of your 
opponent - how far each jab or kick distances you from your 
opponent.  So its simple and deep at the same time.  But in 
general, this is the way to learn buffering.



PLAYER SPECIFIC BUFFERS


Lei Wulong

Starting at the top of Lei's special moves list:

[1], 2, 1 (=1, 1+2 BK, 1) Lei left jabs then hooks to 
recover with his back turned followed by his repeatable 
spinning back-fist. So we get a fast jab to start our 
little combo.  As to the usefulness of this all high 
hitting combo I won't hazard a comment other than to 
say it's a buffered combo which creates a small mix-up 
combo - useful or not, see the possibilities for general 
theory of relativity, Tekken style?  If you can pull off 
a d+1 juggle from BK, everything is relative.

[1], 2, 2 (=1, 1+2, 2) Lei jabs left then hooks to recover 
BK followed by a counter-ably slow, but nonetheless lovely, 
juggling uppercut.  Here's the great thing about buffering:  
these two combos can be started [2], 1.  So from the original 
two combos (1+2, 1 and 1+2, 2) we now have four enhanced 
combos starting from either side.  In theory the same, but 
in practice I've found the [2], 1 starter to be much more 
effective.

F+[1], 2 _ F+[2], 1 (= 1, f+1+2 _ 2, f+1+2) Good news for 
Lei fans: TTT's great new Lei move, Double Snake Punch to 
Crane Stance (f+1+2~F) is buffer-able.  Hold F to go to 
Crane or u or d to go to Panther.

[2], f+3 (=2, f+2+3) Snake Stance.  But not just the tricky 
to input, unprotected stance change rather a right jab that 
is fast, scores 15 points damage, and is followed by a mix-up 
to SNS to fool the best of ‚em. [3], f+2 gives you more room 
to switch but takes away the surprise.  Remember that each 
opponent may necessitate you side-stepping in a different 
direction, ex: SSR vs X, SSL vs Y.

GLITCH: It was assumed that SS+2+3 was a new TTT only chance
for Lei to go into Snake Stance - but it also works in Tekken 3!  
Now apply the above buffers with a side-step, ex: f+[3], SS+2.

[4], SS+1 (= 4, SS+1+4) The other possible side-step to SNS
buffer - also enhanced by appropriate choice of SSL or SSR.

B+[1], 2 (= 1, b+1+2) Another good mix-up: prepare your 
Cannonball head-butt with a strong left jab.  Why b+1?  
Because it scores 13 instead of 7 points damage (a bonus 
glitch to only Lei and Jin). You can turn this one around 
too no problem - jab and hold right punch first, then input 
b+1.  Slight loss in speed but slightly more damage.

B+[1], 4 , 3 (= 1, b+1+4, 3)  OK, you can get to Phoenix 
Stance this way, a jab mix-up to unblockable sounds 
tempting, but the execution/recovery time is horrendous 
so make sure you knock ‚em down first with the 3. Recovery 
or Execution time will indeed be one of the deciding factors 
in your use or abuse of buffered techniques because the 
second button responds only after the first move recovers.  
Combos done with fast recovery moves are advised.

[4], b+3 (= 4, b+3+4) One of the best of the truly useful 
buffered mix-ups.  Instead of just turning your back (albeit 
in itself a useful mix-up) you first deliver a fast right 
kick, then turn BK to start a great guessing game: rave trip, 
spinning uppercut, mid-kick, low spinning juggler, or 
spinning hop-kick?  [3], 4  works too - but don't forget the 
recovery time.

D+[1], 2 _ [1], d+2 (= 1 _ d+1, d+1+2) An even more mixed-up, 
deceptive ruse to do Lei proud.  This time alternate between 
low or high jabs to prepare your drop to Slide position.  
Again, instead of just dropping, you jab then drop.  A 
simpler command input, faster execution time Mix it up with 
[2] or D+[2], 1 to start a right or left guessing game.

[4], d+3 _ D+[4], 3 (= 4 _ 3, d+3+4) These just keep getting 
better.  A fast kick followed by a fast drop to PLD for 
a pop-up launch (3+4) to juggle your merry way home.  D+[3], 
4 or [3], d+4 are also both useful and give the same d+3+4 
result - but is your opponent more likely to strike high or 
low/mid to minor counter your low kick?

NOTE: Buffers from BK position - the back flips don't buffer, 
but one thing that works well as a mix-up is BK [4], D+3 which 
is mid-kick to rave trip to SNS.  Unfortunately, buffers from 
Prone positions are also not possible - the single buttons all 
recover standing - so just press 3+4 instead.

F+[4], 3 (= f+4, f+3+4) One of Lei's favorites.  The f+4 avoids 
many high attacks, does good damage, and knocks your opponent 
down.  By the time he/she jumps up and comes for revenge, Lei 
has been buffered into Drunken Stance and can nail ‚em with 
the Drunken Punch (mid) for 25 damage or hit low for 15 and 
recovery in FCD.  If you happened to whiff the f+4, you might 
catch a high punch retaliation with the drunken parry.  Compare 
to the [3], f+4 or [4], f+3 or F+[3], 4 possibilities.

f, N+[3], f+4, 1 _ 2, 2 (= f, N+3, f+3+4, 1, 2, 2) This 
qualifies as an Advanced Buffer.  Lightening Crescent to 
Drunken Stance with either a Drunken Fist or, new in TTT, 
2 Drunken Punches. 

NOTE:  You'll have noticed that directional commands that 
are included must be held if performed with the first 
button input, but input with the second button if the 
first button was performed alone.  Ex: F+[4], 3  but 
[4], f+3.  In addition, directional buttons must sometimes 
be released or re-pressed before the next command is input.

d+1+3 _ d+2+4  Both low punches and both low kicks can be 
buffered into the low parry for surprising results.  
Remember a low counter attack might follow your low attack 
in order to catch you still crouching.  A low parry will 
set-up your uf+4  hop-kick or df+2 uppercut juggle starter.


SPECIAL THROWS

f, N+[1], uf+2 (= rush punch, uf+1+2) Almost no one expects 
you to stop after only one razor rush punch - unless it's to 
switch to SNS, which they expect to counter, or to hop-kick, 
which they try to block.  Instead, we snatch ‚em up with the 
fast executing Dragon Falls, which recovers FCD.  Easily 
tack-on Deep Sleep, Rave spin, or Go to Sleep for a wake-up 
mix-up.  You can also try f, N+[2] and [1] or [2] starters.

f,  N+[1], SSL, 3 (= f, N+1, SSL (SNS), 1+3) The only drawback 
to this sneaky Snake Stance throw (from the right side is the 
coolest Lei normal throw, Closing Fan) is that you have to 
recover in SNS before pressing the 3.  Hold 1 all the way.  
This is another Advanced Buffering example.

[1], f, f+2 (= 1, f, f+1+2) After knocking them back with a 
jab, jump in there and trip-throw ‚em for 33 additional 
damage. If you use b+[1] to start, the total damage goes 
up to 46 but you must remember to release the b to input 
the f, f+2.



Paul Phoenix

Paul has only a couple of multi-button commands, albeit 
good ones, and luckily a few throws.  These few added 
buffered combos alone can greatly enhance Paul's overall 
game.  In this section, we're going to ask Paul as well 
to demonstrate multi-directional commands buffering.

F+[4], 1 _ F+[1], 4 (= 4 _ 1, f+1+4) Both right kick and 
left jab are fast ways to lead into Paul's Shoulder Ram, 
setting up a nice wake-up game.  Note again: This could 
be input as [1], f+4 or [4], f+1 without holding the 
directional command.

[1], f+2 _ [2], f+1 (= 1 _ 2, f+1+2) Jab left or right to 
God Hand.  With the right jab starter, we score almost 50 
normal damage with the 2nd hit going mid to catch the high 
jab duckers - need I say more?

B+[1], 2 (= 1, b+1+2) Paul's Burning Fist off a jab is 
possible, but following up the simple jab is suicide - 
a good example of execution time spoiling an otherwise 
good buffer.

WELL, that just about does it for the 2-button category - 
unless you want to buffer Paul's reversal - but now comes 
the interesting stuff with directional buffering: FC, df.  
Paul has some great moves off these commands.

d+1, df+2 (= d+1 (FC), df+2) Let's just get heavy right 
away - Hammer Punch to Jaw Breaker.  Combined damage for 
this mid/mid combo is 36.  OK, it does less damage then 
the canned Hammer-Deathfist which also hits mid/mid so 
the blocking is the same - but the timing isn't.  Plus, 
you get style points for this mix-up - and this is only 
the start.

NOTE:  by not holding anything, only the FC is being 
buffered.  Furthermore, any move that recovers crouching 
is in effect the buffered FC for our FC, df commands.

d+1, df+2, 1 (= d+1 (FC), df+2, 1) This time we are 
buffering the FC and increasing the follow-up 
possibilities of our beloved Hammer with the Gut Buster combo.

d+1, df+2, 2 (= d+1 (FC), df+2, 2) Here it is, my favorite 
Hammer Punch mix-up, the Stone (d) Breaker.  An expert 
opponent might block high/high for the Hammer-Deathfist 
but we tack on a low juggler!  Follow with a Falling Leaf 
for damage worthy of a ten-string.  Or they block 
high/low/high for the Hammer-Falling Leaf combo but we 
fool ‚em mid/mid/low for some real bewilderment - don't 
forget to juggle!

NOTE: All of the d+1 buffers could be started with d+2, 
d+3 or d+4 because we buffered the FC, not the punch and 
kick buttons.


SPECIAL THROWS

B+[2], 3 (= 2, b+2+3) I love this throw despite the touchy 
input.  I started buffering Paul to see if I could improve 
my chances of consistently pulling-off this move.  
Unfortunately, the results are also touchy.  Paul's right 
jab of course, is strong ( the left kick is worse) and 
knocks, under normal circumstances, the opponent too far 
away to reach with the grab.  A nice little combo in theory 
at least: Jab and Grab.  TIP:  it can work if it whiffs.

[1], f, f+2 (= 1, f, f+1+2) Just like Lei, Paul can start 
with either a left or right punch followed by one of his 
best throws. These f, f throws are great: push ‚em back 
with a jab, then jump in and grab to throw (like we do in Aikido).

DF+[1], 2 (= df+1, df+1+2) Perhaps the best buffered combo 
throw for Paul.  The mid hitting uppercut usually keeps the 
opponent close enough to grab for the Face Bash.  If the first 
hit is blocked or even whiffed, it sometimes works even better.  
Follow with the Hammer for an easy 12 + 40 + 15 = 67 damage!  
For that matter, any Paul move (ex. QCB+1) where the 1 can be 
held, is buffered to chain into df+2 (if it doesn't CH) for 
the Face Bash.  If you mess up the commands you often get the 
Hammer-Gut buster combo at no extra charge. 

DB+[2], 1 (= db+2, db+1+2) The Ultimate Tackle is buffered 
by means of a low punch (1 or 2 will work).  It may surprise 
your opponent because a buffered tackle executes fairly fast 
- but the telegraphing is still too hideous to fool even a fool.



ADVANCED BUFFERING

Advanced buffering is characterized by complex button 
combinations such as  1) changing or releasing button 
commands  2) holding a button(s) through more than one 
subsequent command  3) pressing a subsequent button more 
than once.  Let's ask Xiaoyu, a character rich in 
multi-button commands to demonstrate.


Ling Xiaoyu

First though, her basic buffering possibilities.  Remember 
as with Lei and Paul that every buffer can be performed 
[1], 2 or [2], 1.  If one directional input is required, 
we have four possibilities: F+[1], 2 or F+[2], 1 but also 
[1], f+2 and [2], f+1.

[4], 3 _ D+[3], 4 (= 4 _ d+3, 3+4 _ d+3+4) Xiaoyu is 
already a great mixer-upper but by buffering her moves 
we can increase her tricky-ness four-fold.  Kick or low 
kick then spin away or near before your next attack or 
combo. [3] as a starter would knock your opponent down 
and a few steps away which pretty much negates your spin.

F+[1], 2 (= 1, f+1+2) Punch left or right (that's the 
last time I'll say it) then cartwheel right.

F+[3], 4 (= f+3, f+3+4) This time flatten them with one 
of my favorite Xiaoyu power shots, the Cloud Kick.  
Why exactly you'd want to cartwheel after knocking 
your opponent flat isn't immediately clear maybe just 
to showboat a little? F+[4], 3 is much more useful - 
afterward you're in position for the Rain Dance Power 
Hook Kick (4).

[1], 2 (= 1, 1+2) I could have listed this first under 
Xiao's special moves but since it's new to TTT,  it's 
new to me.  Like Lei's new F+1+2, this move, Birds Flock, 
doesn't need to be buffered to be great, but  a quick jab 
intro doesn't help - your opponent!

[3], f, f+4 (= 3, f, f+3+4) Here is a use for the standing 
3 kick that knocks down your opponent then follows up with 
the Front Layout which scores a hit if they stand up 
without rolling.  If you try this f, F+[4], 3 you get the 
Step Kick to Cartwheel Left because only the second f is 
buffered (= f+3+4).  f, F+[3], 4 will be shown later under 
Xiaoyu's advanced buffers.

[1], b+2 (= 1, b+1+2) Proceed to Hypnotist Stance via a jab 
then afterwards a follow up.  B+[1], 2 or B+[2], 1 produces 
the excellent mid parry, The Great Wall, left or right to 
HYP and perhaps beyond, but it has tricky timing. Even though 
the directional command is shown here with a capital B, meaning 
to hold, you must release it shortly after inputting the 
second button.

[4], b+3 (= 4, b+3+4) Like Lei, instead of just turning your 
back to the enemy, kick ‚em first.

[1], 4 (= 1, 1+4) Jab to High/mid Parry (maybe if you whiff 
a lot of jabs).

D+[4], 1 (= d+4, d+1+4) Low kick to Low Parry - for when 
you're feelin' Eddie wary.  Hold the 1 to tack-on more fun.

Speaking of fun, we can also jab and/or kick then follow 
with a taunt: [1], [2], 3 or [2], [3], 4.

d+[1], [2], 1 (= d+1, d+1+2, 1+2) the drop to Phoenix Stance 
can be proceeded by the Sunset fan.  It's the same as the 
normal Flapping wings D+1 but by holding the 2 and pressing 
1 once more, you get the juggler Wave Crest-Power!  We're now 
heading into Advanced Buffering:
 
We wouldn't normally think there's a buffer for a one 
button command, even an excellent one like Xiao's f, f+3 
Raccoon Swing. But if we do it:

f, F+[3], 4, 4 (= f, f+3, 3+4, 3+4) Holding 3 all the way, 
we get the Raccoon Swing followed the California Roll to 
Kangaroo Kick!  An awesome high-damage combo that serves 
up, as Catlord would say, "Juggle du jour".

[2], b+[1], 2 (= 2, b+1+2, 1+2) We probably won't find a 
finer way to attempt Xiaoyu's unblockable Thunder Strike.  
If you miss it you might get the Spin Sticker if yer lucky.

U+[1], [2], 2, 1 (= u+1, u+1+2, 2, 1) Yep, that's Back 
Palm-Forward to Fortune Cookie. Guess you just got to buy 
Tragic's (Ben Cureton's) book now!

F, F+[1], [2], 1 (= 1, f, f+1+2, 1+2)  A Phoenix Wings short 
cut - but hopefully not clipped short.


ADVANCED DIRECTIONALS

Xiaoyu has even more FC, df moves than Paul and with several 
different starters (including both d+ and RC possibilities) 
it would take awhile to list them all.  Using only d+1 as my 
starter, here are a couple:

D+1, df+2, 1, df+4, 4, WS+2 (BK), 2, 2, 2 3 _ 4 (= d+1 (RC), 
df+2, 1 (RC), df+4, 4 WS+2 (JG, BK), 2, 2, 2, 3 _ 4)  Sunset 
Fan (RC) to Lotus Twist (RC) to Sun Flower (JG, BK) juggle 
ending with 3 for more damage or 4 to juggle some more!

d+1, 3, 2, 1, 4 (= d+1 (RC), 3, 2, 1, 4)  Sunset Fan to Fire 
Dancer.  After any move that recovers crouching (ex. df+4, 4) 
we can initiate the Fire Dancer.  This is again buffering the FC.

Maybe a couple more mix-ups:

d+1, df+2 (= d+1 (RC), df+2 (BK) Sunset to Shady Lotus to 
recover into Rain Dance.

d+1, db+[3], 4 (= d+1 (RC), db+3, db+3+4)  Sunset to low kick 
to Low Back Turn.


SPECIAL THROWS

Xiaoyu is a thrower's delight.  Oddly enough, she doesn't 
really have any 2 button special throws to speak of but she 
has so many special moves with 1 or 2, in addition to the 
normal jabs, that it's possible to throw the whole match (no 
pun intended of course) - intentional or not!  MASHERS take 
note: (I for one am convinced the unintentional buffering is 
what makes lucky mashers the great pain in the ass that they 
are) just hold down 1 or 2 and mash out those throws!

Xiaoyu's weakness, her short reach, is actually her throwing 
strength: most of her moves leave her very close to her opponent 
so tossing's only a snatch away.  Not listing them all:

df+[1], 3 (= df+1, 1+3) Belly chop to Jade. Ain't that sweet...

DF+[1], 2, 3 (= df+1, df+1+2, 1+3)  Again advanced buffering.  
Hold the 1 all the way through for Belly Chop to Phoenix Stance 
to Jade.  Mixing it up.

u+[1] _ U+[1], 3 (= u+1 _ U+1 (BK), 3) Back Palm to Jade, 
front or back.

uf+[2], 4 (= u+2, 2+4) A good hit (stun) off of Cyanide 
will definitely leave you in throwing range.

D+[1], [2], 3 (= d+1, d+1+2, 1+3)  Sunset fan to Phoenix 
to Jade.  Buffering gets us there a little faster and helps 
to mix things up.

Df+[2], 4 (= df+2, 2+4) Butter the Bread - yer dead!  (I'll 
settle for the KO).

From Rain Dance:

f, F+[3], 4 (= f, f+3, f, f+3+4) Buffering from Peg Leg to 
Back Layout, just for fun.

f, F+[3], 1 (= f, f+3, f, f+1+3)  Even better.  After Peg 
Leg, spin around and throw with Jump reverse Clutch.

NOTE:  There's a lot more to check out, especially in 
Raindance and Phoenix - and not just for throwing either, 
but hey, remember, this is my first FAQ!  I think we'll 
let the rest ride till next version 3.0 - but by then 
you'll probably have started finding a lot of stuff 
yourselves so I think I'll move on...



BONUS

I couldn't resist a few choice Anna Williams buffers.  
Anna is truly a Mystic Booty buffering bonanza - so 
let's start there:

[3], 1+2, 4, 3 (= 3, 1+2+3, 4,3) Left kick (knockdown) to 
Mystic Booty taunt with a fast turning low/high kick combo 
to keep ‚em off your butt.

[1], b+[2], SS+1, d+3 (= 1, b+1+2, SS+1+2, d+3) Jab to 
Single Slap to Bloody Chaos (JG) to low kick.  Or just 
start with b+[2], SS+1.

SS+[2], 1 _ 4 (= SS+2, WS 1+2 _ 2+4) I know it sounds crazy 
but when you hold the 2 then hit the 1 you get the Anna Bomb.  
If that isn't cool enough, check out the throw alternative.

[2], d+1 (= 2, d+1+2) We like to at least try for unblockables, 
"bloody" or not!

d+3, FC f+1, d+3,4 (= d+3 (RC) f+1, d+3,4) Low kick to Bloody 
Spear to Low Left/High Right kicks.

d+4 _ d+1, f+[2], 4 (= d+4  _ d+1 (RC) f+2, 2+4) Low kick or 
punch to Overhead Windmill with follow up throw. d+4 should 
give you the side throw, Trick Embrace Strike.

d+1, FC df+2, d+3, 4 (= d+1 (RC),df+2, d+3, 4) Low jab to Low 
Arm Sweep.  Juggle with d+3, 4. Oo-o-ohh, baby!

[2] _ b+[2], uf+1 (= 2 _ b+2, uf+1+2)  Jab or slap to grab.  
Tack on a running attack.



 MULTI-THROWS

Until such time that Mike Nappi or another true King/Armor 
King master steps forward, willing to divulge a few of the 
secrets that usually remain the providence of those on the 
"highest levels" of Tekkening, this section must be considered 
Under Construction. Nicky Quick is not a King player - well, 
not yet anyway.  I know Nina much better but, in any case, I 
find it more difficult to input all that acrobatic stuff on 
an arcade controller than on a PSX controller. Life was easier 
in some ways with R1, R2, L1 and L2. It cost me many hours 
to get the Tendon Lock (1,3 2+4, 3+4, 1+2) to work on arcade 
buttons - the joke I think being on us - as in whose tendons 
are being locked?  Again buffering provides a key.


Nina Williams

[4], QCF+[3], 4 , 4, [2], 1 (= 4, QCF+3+4, 3+4, 4, 2, 1+2) 
Crab Claw to Heel Hold.  It's pretty hard, buffering or not, 
to get this input to cooperate - but Practice Makes Perfect 
(if we understand Lei's movie correctly)!  Indeed if we 
understand Lei's movie correctly, we also understand that 
a very important part of training is to know when to take 
it easy.  Buffer or Suffer.

Without the buffer above, we have three, 2-button inputs 
including - let's just call it a "simple split", 3+4, 1+2, 
easy horizontals.  But multi-buttons as used especially in 
multi-throws, seem to abound in not only these, but also 
"vertical splits" (1+3, 2+4), "hard splits" (2+3, 1+4) or 
even "combo splits" - like my favorite follow up to Heel 
Hold, Tendon Lock (2+4, 3+4, 1+2).  You have to be a real 
dancer to input accurately and it's easy to slip up.  
Starting with a fast right kick, the buffered version 
has NO double buttons until after the Heel Hold. I have 
to confide it seems easier to input the Tendon Lock follow 
up as 1, 3, 2+4, 3+4, 1+2 than as 1, 3, 2+[4], 3, 1+2. 
Practice makes perfect. Since however, it'll get even more 
rad - even with fingers crossed, in the "Advanced Multi-Throw 
Bitchin' Bufferin' Section", don't worry too much about these.


[2], QCF+1 (= 2, QCF+1+2) Jab to Palm Grab.
 = 2, 3, 4, 2, 2 Double Attack
  = 1, 3+4, 1, [1], 2 (= 1, 3+4, 1, 1, 1+2) Neck Crusher 
at a modest savings.
  = 1, [2], 4, [3], 1 (=1, 2, 4, 3, 1+2+3) Galetech Stretch 
your fingers! If you try to buffer the 1 from the beginning, 
you'll get the 1+2+3 one move too soon - food for thought.

QCB+1+4 (= QCB+1+4) Betrayer.  Unless we find a move with 1 
or 4 that doesn't push our opponent too far away, we'll have 
to settle for the "hard split". The compensation isn't bad as 
this move ducks high attacks (if yer timing's right) and 
auto-blocks low ones. Nina has to be pretty close though to 
reach.
 = 2, [1], 2, 2, 3 (= 2, 1, 1+2, 1+2, 3) Octopus Grab. No DBs 
(double buttons)
  = 1, 3+4, [1], 2, 2 (= 1, 3+4, 1, 2, 2, 1+2) Neck Crusher. 
No DBs.
  = 1, [2], 4, [3], 1 Galetech Stretch ‚em again.

 = 1, 3, 2, 1 (= 1, 3, 2, 1) Standing Reverse Arm Lock.  
To mix.up or betray your opponents breakout attempt when 
she/he assumes your doing the Octopus follow up.
  = 2, [1], 3, 4, 2 (= 2, 1, 3, 4, 1+2) Falling Reverse 
Armlock to follow up the SRAL. It's a finger crosser to 
hold the 1 all the way but, Hey, anything to save a button!
  = 3, [1], 4, 2, 2 (= 3, 1, 4, 1+2, 1+2) Rear Galetech.  
Same buffering idea, different result.



King

I just BECAME a King player!  It's a very enlightening 
irony, after cajoling you to "choose a character rich 
in multi-button commands", that I, before the reader's 
very eyes, should at this time first "discover" King for 
the awesome self that he is.  This can truly be a site 
Under Construction now.  I can just keep adding 
indefinitely till version 218.0 or so.  This will become 
an "Alter to King's Buffered Awesome-ness" or something! 
Please indulge just a few easy combos before the 
Multi-Throw-Show begins:

[1], 2, 1 (= 1, 1+2, 1) Axle Spinner with a jab beginner.

[4], df+3 (= 4, df+3+4) Right kick (a big 26 damage) to 
Frankensteiner, 60 (at least!) damage - don't ever cry 
and moan again about Deathfists and Rave Spins!

F, f+[2], f,d,df+1 (= f, f+2, f,d,df+1+2) Power Upper to 
Black Bomb.  Paul be knowin' where this all come from.  
We're talkin' Soul now.  Obviously Tekken already has 
enough techno killers, (no offense Yoshi), zombies 
(actually I'm a Brian fan too) and otherwise pure white 
skinned, cold-blooded ninja for your sister types (yes, 
I've made Kunimitsu's aquaintance) or major destruction 
Proto- bionics types  as it is and was in need of some 
Duende Caliente - but now back to work:

[2], f+1 (= 2, f+1+2) Right jab to left Iriminage 
(Jaguar Lariat) unblockable. Worth a try to make them cry.

[3], f+2 (= 3, f+2+3) Left kick to Shoulder Tackle.  
The lovely but slow executing Shoulder Tackle is given 
another chance by the left kick which knocks your opponent 
down just inside of - you guessed it, Shoulder Tackle range.


[4], SS+3 (= 4, SS+3+4) Kick to Boomerang.  It's been said 
a lot, but don't under estimate mix-ups and simpler inputting.

[1], f,f,N, 2 (= 1, f,f,N, 1+2) Jab to Push back.

f,f+[2], f+1 (= f,f+2, f+1+2) Power Upper to Jaguar Lariat.

[3], 4,  f,f+1+2 (= 3, 3+4, f,f+1+2) Kick to Exploder (KND) 
to Cross Chop Block.

b+[4], 1 (= b+4 (BK), 1+4) Prison Break to Moonsault. Soulful. 

[1], d+2 (= 1, d+1+2) Jab to Mini Elbow Drop.

[1], f,f+2 (= 1, f,f+1+2) Jab to Lay Off!

So maybe I should.  If that was a folder not yet even full 
of normal and advanced buffers, a veritable Thesaurus of 
buffering is next:


King's Multi-Throws

[2], b+[1] (= 2, b+1+2) Let's start with the Irish Whip 
and its buffer-able links.
 = 3  if we buffer the 1 above, we only need 3 to get 
the Spin Feint.
 = 4  if we buffer only the 2 above we get the Quick 
Slam (hot damn!) with 4.
 = 1  if we hold both the 1 and 2 above and hit either 
again we get Turn Around.
 = 3+4 - no buffer from Irish Whip for Destruction.

d,df,f+[1] (= QCF+1) Again, buffering the 1 from 
Jaguar Driver sets up:
 = 2 (= 1+2) Face Buster
 = 2, 3, 4, 2 (= 1+2, 3, 4, 1+2) Here's where it gets 
cool.  Believe it or not, we can hold 1 all the way 
through the Boston Crab because there are no double 
buttons that require a different button be buffered. 
You need to run like a crab to not thumb this one.

[4], f,N,d,df+[1] (= 4, f,N,d,df+1+4) Easier to start 
kicking than to cross finger a "hard split" crouch dash 
1+4 Arm Breaker.  If we buffered the 1 as well, we can tap 
2 twice:
 = 2, 2 (= 1+2, 1+2) to get Triple Buster
 = 2, 3, 4, 2 (= 1+2, 3, 4, 1+2) Same chowder as before 
for Boston Crab.
 = 2, [4], 2 (= 1+2, 4, 2+4) Head Jammer.  Remember we're 
holding the 1.
  = 4, 3 [4], 3, 1+2 (= 4, 3, 4, 3+4, 1+2) Buffering where 
we can as we go from link to link - here the Struggle Combo.
 = [2], [1], 3 (= 2, 1, 1+2+3) Chicken Wing variations from 
Arm Breaker. 
  = [2], [1], 3, 4, 4 (= 2, 1, 3, 1+2+4, 1+2+4) Dragon 
Sleeper - advanced buffering at its craziest? NO - check 
out this Advanced Bitchin' Bufferin':
  = [3], [4] [2], [1], 3 (= 1+3, 3+4, 2+4, 1+2, 1+2+3) R.D.C.  
This last link from Chicken Wing is worth 70 damage alone but 
I think it was KO before we even got this far!

NOTE: Just to make it clear: you can try to contort your 
fingers into holding all the buttons at once but they can 
and should be held in succession or only as long as necessary.

[2], SS+[4] (= 2, SS+2+4) Reverse Full Nelson.
 = 2, [2], 1 (= 2, 2, 1+2) Cannonball
  = 1, 2, 3+4 (= 1, 2, 3+4) Power Bomb, no buffers.
   = 2, 1, 3, 4 (= 2, 1, 3, 4) Big Swing, no buffers.
   = [3], 1, 2, [4], 1+2 (= 3, 1, 2, 3+4, 1+2+3+4) T-Bone.  
Again, if we tried to buffer the 1 and 2 instead of the 4, 
we would arrive at the 1+2+3+4 one command too early.
  = 3, 1, 1 (= 3+4, 1+2, 1+2+4) Manhattan Drop.  If we were 
to hold the [4] all the way from the Reverse Full Nelson and 
the [2] from the Cannonball, we would have an easy time of 
this otherwise difficult "combo split" Full Nelson fingering.
   = 1, [2], 3, 1 (= 1, 2, 3+4, 1+2) If we were still holding 
the 4 from above and now the 2 here, we could continue our 
bitchin' bufferin'.
    = 2, 1, 3, 4 (= 2, 1, 3, 4) If you got this far, 
congratulations.  Now you can let everything go for the Big Swing.
    = [3], 1, 2, [4], 1+2 (= 3, 1, 2, 3+4, 1+2+3+4) T-Bone, 
same menu as before.

LISTEN, if this section is still Under Construction, then 
I'm finished for now with Version 2.0 - especially if I want 
to have time to share some buffers for Hwoarang and Law.  
See you here again in a future up-date.



ADDITIONAL CHARACTER SPECIFIC BUFFERS


Hwoarang

From the lack of 2-button commands, it would appear at a 
glance, that "Bob" has no chance.  But combining moves to 
buffer into his two spectacular normal front throws is in 
itself a thrill - and maybe just the chance Bob needs to 
become a buffering Star.

[1], 2, 3 (= 2, 1+2, 1+3) Right jab to Disrespect to Pickpocket.  
1, [2], 4 would of course lead to Human Cannonball but seems 
to always come up short.  Pickpocket almost never comes up 
short, the pay-off is always within reach.

[4], 3 _ [3], 4 (= 4, 3+4 _ 3, 3+4) Kick ‚em, then Stance 
Change. Again, holding the second command would set-up 
Pickpocket or Human Cannonball.

[3], 4 (= 3~4) Flying Eagle. The quick taps are buffers 
but again the "catch": the second command must be input before 
the first fully recovers.

[1], df+2 (= 1, df+1+2) Jab to Body Blow.  To help Hwoarang's 
mix-up game, alternate between the four possible starters: [2], 
df+1 or df+[1], 2 or df+[2], 1.

[3], db+4 (= 3, db+3+4) Any number of kick combos ending 
on 3 or 4 could theoretically buffered into the Dynamite 
Heel. Distance to target would be the determining factor.  
Try this: Launch ‚em high with Wing Blade (crouch dash+4), 
juggle ‚em with Hunting Hawk, uf+3, 4, [3] then finish the 
demo off with (perhaps a quick side-step first) db+4 - DYNAMITE!

LFL 1+4  Sorry, no jab to Power Blaster buffer. Both 1 and 
recover out of LFL.


SPECIAL THROWS

Hwoarang has so many possible ways to buffer into all the 
normal throws (if you like to side-step) that they're all 
sort of Special:

LFF F+[4], 1, 2 (= f+4, 1, 2+4) Funny, the only one who noted 
that Doggie Lift recovers in RFL seems to have been gargoyle 
sox, to me the best Hwoarang Guide writer.  Maybe no one noticed 
because it's the beginning of Bob's LFF ten-string. It's followed 
by a Left-Backhand to Human Cannonball throw. Now you're only, 
give or take a little, half a life-bar from victory - time for 
your opponent to tag out.  As gargoyle says, I love this combo 
like family.

RFF F+[3], 2, 1 (= RFF f+3, 2, 1+3)  Same brew as above, 
but from RFF. Here the command for Pickpocket is 1+3 but from RFF, 
even 2+4 will give you the Pickpocket.

Here are just a couple of starters for use with either normal 
throws or the RFF Cheap Shot to Right-Backhand to Pickpocket.

f+2, RFF F+[3], 2, 1     or     f+[2], 4 (= Pickpocket)
b+4, RFF F+[3], 2, 1     or     b+[4], 2
b+2, RFF F+[3], 2, 1     or     b+[2], 4

A few more buffered combos:

f+2, RFF 2 ,2, [1], 3 (= f+2, RFF 2, 2, 1, 1+3) Rusty Knife 
to Big Fists to Pickpocket.  If you find after jabbing that 
you are too far away, make the last command f+3 or f, 3.

Db+[4], 2 (= Db+4, 2+4) Low kick (the Crippler) to Human 
Cannonball.  Take That!

d+[4], WS+2 (= d+4, 2+4)  Well, you'll get the 2+4 throw or 
a juggling uppercut - can't go wrong either way.

d+[2], WS+4 (= d+2, 2+4)  This time if you see that you're 
getting the Tsunami Kick instead of the throw, tack-on 
another 4 to finish it.



Forrest Law

Bruce Lee has always been my favorite martial artist.  Why 
he's not my main man in Tekken 3 and TTT, I'm not sure. It 
doesn't bother me in the slightest that many Tekken players 
consider him "cheap" - that's just sour grapes.  Besides, 
all's fair in love and Tekken.  Law does however have enough 
buffered combos to restore him to the exalted position 
bestowed upon his benefactor - and to cure him of the 
lingering Somersault Syndrome from which he seems to suffer.

[4], 3 (= 4, 3+4) Kinda hard to cure SS (not side-stepping, 
Somersault Syndrome) when the first buffer down the list is 
the Quick Somersault.  The good news is this move recovers 
RC - Law has so many FC moves that we could write a whole 
FAQ just on his buffers alone!

[4], 3, 4 (= 4, 3+4, 4) This time the left kick followed 
by the Back Flipper RC recovering juggle - buffer so they 
suffer before screaming CHEAP!

[4], d+3 (= 4, d+3+4) Frogman from this, or this, D+[3], 
4 or this, [3], d+3+4). NOTE: If you try D+[4], 3 you will 
get two low kicks because D+4 recovers crouching but D+3 
does not.  You can do it with d+[4] (releasing the d) but 
you have to wait till Law recovers standing before inputting 
the 3.  I think the only real use for this move is if you 
whiff the first kick, you do a "fall-back jumper" (like NBA 
style, you know what I'm talkin' ‚bout?) -and kick their 
teeth in on your way down.

[4], SS+3 (= 3, SS+3+4) Double Dragon.  It works better 
with 4 then SS+3 but if you really want all three hits to 
connect consistently, do it (facing right) SSL, [4], SS+3.

D+1, (FC) Uf+4 (= d+1, FC, Uf+4) Using a low punch again to 
buffer our FC, we finish with a kind of far away after a 
buffered punch or kick, Catapult Low.

NOTE:  Once last time, any move recovering RC is the buffered 
FC for any multi-directionals that could follow.  I'm not 
going to list them all, how about after 3, 3, 3, 4: Triple 
Head Kick-Somersault (RC) going into Catapult High?

B+[1], 2 _ B+[2], 1 (= b+1, b+1+2 _ b+2, b+1+2) Either 
the first hit of the Dragon Storm or the first hit of the 
Junkyard Attack to Trick Step.  I like this move: If your 
opponent tries to punch you back for her/his minor counter, 
Law's Punch Reversal is waiting. Whether you go into Law's 
Trick Step or Punch Reversal, let ‚em have afterwards with 
the Fatal Backhand/Dragon Blow!


SPECIAL THROWS

First a couple "special" normal throws:

b+[1], 3 (= b+1, 1+3) Dragon Fire.  I love this one.

b+2, [3], 1 (= b+2, 3, 1+3) Dragon Fire from the Junkyard.

d+[1],N, 3 (= d+1, 1+3) You have to let Law recover standing 
first but, hey, Anything for a Dragon Fire!

DF+[1], 2~1~[2]~1 (= df+1, df+1+2, 1, 2, 1+2) Chastisement 
buffered into Bulldog.  Law's only multi-throw (and it's 
way cool)!

[4], f, f+3 (= 4, f, f+3+4) Play it again: these f, f+ 
throws are great! Right kick to Knee Lift. df+[3], 
f, f+4 is also up-lifting.

[2], f+3 (= 2, f+2+3) Hard to grab this one unless you're 
close, which the jab doesn't help - but I'm all out of throws 
and I'm all out of time. 



Jin Kazama

Buffering can offer Jin many fast and mixed-up ways to start
the White Heron combos, unblockable uppercuts, and normal 
throws.  Thanks to a large number of 2-button commands, Jin's
moves list begins to resemble Lei's, King's, or Nina's -
2 pages long!  In addition, buffering helps to boner Jin's
repertoire of cool throws.

In order to buffer the White Heron we must be able to hold
1 or 4.  The list is long:

[1], 4 (= 1, 1+4) the start of many mix-ups - enough to out-
fox even a seasoned Jin opponent.

[1], 4, 3 (= 1, 1+4, 1+3) buffered into Double Kicks.

[1], [4], 2 (= 1, 1+4, 2+4) Holding 1 doesn't effect the 
buffered 2+4 Shoulder Throw.

1, [1], 4 (= 1, 1, 1+4) If we finish the Shining Fists with
the 2, we render the buffered White Heron useless (you Do 
Know how far away Jin slams his opponent with this hit, 
don't you?).

[1], 2, 4 (= 1, 2, 1+4) One-Two Punches. Hmm, the recovery 
time after the second punch could/should be better.

[1], 2, 2, 4 (= 1, 2, 2 ,1+4) Holding 1 through both 2 inputs
is no problem.  Tap 3 after the White heron start to go into
Double Kicks or hold [4] then tap 2 again to get the Shoulder 
Reverse.

[1], 2, 3, 4 (= 1, 2 ,3, 1+4) Here's where to buffer gets rougher:
If we wait till [1], 2 recovers, we'll get a throw attempt when 
we tap 3. After that, if we hit the 4 too soon, we'll get the
complete One-two-Split-Axe Kick - but if we wait too long to
tap 4, we'll miss the White Heron juggle coming off the 1, 2, 3
single Axe!

1, 2, [4] (= 1, 2, 4, 1+4) Starting the White Heron after the 
One-Two Knee.

df+[1], 4 _ df+[1], 2, 4 (= df+1, 1+4 or df+1, 2, 1+4) To buffer
the Heron after the Twin Lancers (one or both hits) you must
release the df so Jin recovers standing.  As above, if you
wait/hold too long before entering the 2, you'll get the
Ultimate tackle instead of Twin Lancers.

NOTE: We're talking about a "Window of Time" (thanks Catlord)
In which to enter the buffer - as in multi-throws and 10-strings.

df+[4], 1 _ 3 (= df+4, 1+4 _ d+3+4) If you complete the Double
Axe Jin will be too far away to connect with the Heron. A juggle
through the Can-Can kicks is available with 3.

[3], d+[4], 1 (= 3, d+3+4, 1+4) Jin's left kick is useful 
because unlike the 4, which knocks your opponent flying, 3 
keeps you close enough to connect with the second leg of the 
Can-Cans.  Hold 4 to juggle with the Heron.

d+4 _ d+3, WS+[4], 1 (= d+4 _ 3, WS+4, 1+4) Half a rising Axe 
will allow you to buffer into the White Heron.

uf+4, 4, [4], 1 (= uf+4, 4 , 4, 1+4) Far fetched but, if
your opponent rolls forward...

2, b+[1], 4 (= 2, b+1+2, 1+4) Can't tell Jin this isn't a cool 
combo. If they bounce off your Force Block, crouch dash ‚em! 

b, f+2, [1], 4 (= b, f+2, 1, 1+4) Or after the second hit of 
Laser Cannon change to the Heron.


WELL, that's at least a Baker's Dozen ways to start the 
White Heron. Whether to finish the combo (glazed) or to 
throw (powdered) - it's your donut. 


[4], B+1 (= 4, B+1+4) Following a knock-down spinner like 
Jin's 4, the Lightening Uppercut will fall short unless they 
move toward you upon standing, so use the Super Twist Uppercut
instead.

uf+[4], b+1 (= uf+4, b+1+4) The first hit of the Leaping Spin 
Kicks puts Jin in range for the Lightening Uppercut!

b, f+2, [1], b+4 (= b, f+2, 1, b+1+4) A stun off the second
hit of Laser Cannon might just do the trick.

f+[4], b+1 (= f+4, b+1+4) Another small chance to surprise?

Moves with 4 or 1 that don't leave Jin enough room to power
up his unblockables will present even greater problems
than these but - hey, isn't every unblockable a problem?


CROUCH DASH
I wanted to be able to say we can buffer hits onto every
directional command in the CD: f, d, df. But as you can 
imagine this would inhibit the flow of the movement, in
fact turning it into a three move poker to juggle combo: 
f+2, d+3, df+2. The GOOD news is, we can attach a strike
to the f, command and flow right on through to the dash.
Indeed a directional buffering addition to the already
deadly dash.

f+2, d, df+[4], b+1 (= f+2, f, d, df+4, b+1+4) Just to start
off crazy, I've buffered the Power Overhead to the Hell Sweeps
first hit to the Lightening Uppercut.  As Einstein showed,
the theoretical can become the physical. E=MC2 (Energy =
Major Counter, squared).

f+1 is probably the easiest starter because of it's recovery
time but f+4 knee is also very interesting. The obvious choices,
just mix ‚em up:

f+1, d, df+1 (= f+1, f, d, df+1) Left jab to Thunder Godfist.
f+4, d, Df+2 (= f+4, f, d, Df+2) Knee to Electric Wind Godfist.
f+2, d, df+4, 4, 4, 4 (= f+2, f, d, df+4, 4...) Overhead to
Hell Sweeps.  Remember these can be chained to subsequent 
techniques and buffers.


SPECIAL THROWS

Buffering some normal throws was described above, if only 
briefly.  Here are Jin's three Specials:

1, [2], f, f+1
1, 2, [2], f, f+1      4 possible Stone Heads
[2], f, f+1
f+[2], f, f+1

[2], df+3
[3], df+2              4 Elbow Slams
f+[2], df+3
df+1, [2], df+3

[1], QCB+3  Trip Wire.  Without your opponent walking into the 
second part of this buffer, you won't reach.



Julia Chang

Ah, Julia.   With a movie like hers, she should be everyone's 
favorite.  To protect Mother Earth we probably are going to 
have to fight, so it's good we have Tekken to practice.

It's important not to get predictable with Julia's 2+3 and 
1+4 moves, central to her arsenal though they might be.
Completing the 2+3, 1 Ultimate Cannon is predictable. 
Buffering into and out of it is not.  There are just too
many possible continuations available. 

[2], 3, (= 2, 2+3) You may follow up a successful right jab
with a low hitting one leading to a mid kick but often times
the low jab will be short. This would be an excellent follow
up to a fake/whiff jab or kick because the buffer continues
on combo fashion: after whiffing a jab you counter your
opponent's counter attempt with low and mid strikes then
follow with d+4, 1 or  [4], 1 (RC) or even the rest of the 
Ultimate Cannon by pressing 1.

[1], 4 (= 1, 1+4) Likewise the 1+4.  Actually the somewhat 
slow downward fist of Julia's Axe-Mini Bow is a better
follow up to the 4 kick so it's better to buffer it [4], 
1 - but if the right kick whiffs, your counter is a bit slow.
Since this move recovers RC however, it's too important
to just not use it. Any Julia player knows there are at 
least 7 WS combos to buffer into from RC moves like 1+4.

[2], 1 (= 2, 1+2) Using Julia's fast, strong right jab to
set up the Twin Arrow.

[4], 3 (= 4, 3+4) Like Xiaoyu, Julia can kick then spin 
sideways.  If you buffer 3 you'll send them flying, 
negating your spin.  Finish with the Roundhouse.

uf+[4], 3 (= uf+4, uf+3+4) The only way this is gonna work
is to launch with uf+4, then Foot Stomp down on the back of 
their head as they're standing - which looks really mean, 
but wouldn't you rather juggle?

F+[1], 4 (= f+1, f+1+4) Flash Uppercut to Heaven Cannon.  
I thought I'd at least mention it.


DIRECTIONALS

It took some work but it goes like this: Julia's Thunder Palm
d,df+1 and Lightening Bolt d,df+1, 2 are two of her best power 
moves which are often performed while running (f,f,f+1) and
can be used to great effect in countering and wake-up games.
It's performed with a more or less direct slap into df+1. It
will not buffer like this: d+4 _ d+2, df+1 - but it will 
buffer like this: d+4 _d+2, df+2.  In other words we can tag
a hit onto our first directional command d, but it will only
work as a buffer to the second hit of the Lightening Bolt
combo.  This is none other than one of Julia's FC moves: 
Body Elbow.

d+4, (FC) df+2 (= d+4, FC df+2) Low kick to Body Elbow.

d+3, (FC) df+4, 3 (= d+3, FC df+4,3) Low kick to Bow and Arrow.

[4], 1 (RC) df+4, 3 (= 4, 1+4, FC df+4,3) Adding an intro and
an extra low hit makes this 1+4, 3 less predictable.

[2], 3, d+4, df+4,3 (= 2, 2+3, d+4, df+4,3) We buffer both
to disguise our 2+3 to mix it up with 3 hits in the place of 
two high, low, mid.  Instead of finishing the Ultimate Cannon
2+3,1 we go into d+4. Rather than finishing the d+4,1 Razors 
Edge (a move which our opponents know all too well) se use
the d+1 to buffer the FC then go into the Bow and Arrow as 
a mix-up. Now we can use our predictable Razors Edge to juggle!


SPECIAL THROWS

I'm going to continue the directionals discussion just a bit
farther here:

d+[1], db, d, db+2 (= d+1,db,d,db+1+2) The Cross Arm Suplex
buffers nicely if you input before the db motions move Julia
back out of reach.

QCB, f+2  The Mad Axes are everybody's favorite Mother Earth
protector. QCB is like the ultimate directional buffering
exercise: After launching, while running, jumping, back-dashing,
recovering - you name it, wherever you have enough breathing
room to do it, QCB can be input.  The choices are only limited
to those of timing and distance.

d, db+1+3  Waist Suplex.  Forget about buffering this one unless 
you want a mixed-up way to get the Low Parry. 

df+[2], 1 (= df+2, df+1+2) Once in awhile you get the Arm Lock
Suplex but if you're really lucky you get the Power Punch 
Launcher andcan then time a Palm explosion just right to
keep 'em off their feet.  Remember our Thunder Palm d,df+1
that wouldn't buffer?  Use it like this: d, df+[1], 2 and
you will sometimes get the throw!


WELL, as a "see you later" I want to remind you that those
left kicks that send your opponent flying are there for a
reason: [3], 2+4  - for waving BYE, BYE!  


Be cool.

 
 
POSTSCRIPT to Version 2.5

I hope this proves helpful to those who are interested in 
broadening their understanding of certain aspects of Tekken 
inputting not explained in official Tekken documentation.  
It is dedicated solely to the advancement of Tekken knowledge 
and Art in general, and to repay in part, that which I've 
borrowed from all of you who are as enthusiastic about Tekken 
as I am.

A second Thank You is indeed in order to those who have made 
all the FAQs and multi-media available to us - the Tekken web 
sites (to mention only a few):

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

To Tragic.  I've referred to the techniques used in this FAQ 
by the names (which differ from Namco's) used in your book The 
Unauthorized Tekken 3 Fighting Guide - Thanks, I hope this is 
OK with you. Names for TTT techniques used in this FAQ are 
borrowed from Catlord's TTT movelist. Thanks, I hope you don't
