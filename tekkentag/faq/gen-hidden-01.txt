                            2. Legal Stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


You may download and print this FAQ, but under no circumstances can you
put this FAQ on your web page without our permission.  You MAY NOT ALTER
IT IN ANY WAY or claim it as your own.

From this point on, I will only be sending FAQ updates to GameFAQs, IGN,
and Tekken Zaibatsu.  Anyone who has recevived permission to host any of
the Tekkenomics FAQs also has permission to host any of our future
text-based FAQs (unless specified), and can obtain updates from any of
the previously mentioned websites.

                         3. FAQ Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Ever since I first played Tekken Tag Tournament on the PS2, I noticed that
all available moves in the Tekken games were not included in the move lists
of each fighter.  When Tekken 4 has been released, I decided to take the
time to put together a list of all of the moves that I have noticed that
somehow evaded the command lists.  After I put a lot of work and time in
finding the hidden moves in Tekken 4, I decided to go back to Tekken Tag
Tournament and put together a FAQ of all of its hidden moves.

This FAQ only covers the moves that are missing in the PS2 Tekken Tag
Tournament (U.S. Version) command lists.  These moves should work on the
Arcade and other PS2 Versions of Tekken Tag Tournament, but I only tested
these moves on the U.S. Version.

Because Tekken has so many moves that can be linked together, not all
the commands for these moves were included in the move lists.  Listed
in here are moves and button combinations not found specifically in any
of the move lists within the Tekken Tag Tournament PS2 game.  Also
included are commands with unique properties.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                            4. Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The purpose of this FAQ is to try to inform the Tekken Tag Tournament
players of the commands that are available to them, aside from what
they have been provided with in the in-game move lists.  These moves
were obtained various ways: experimenting with button combinations while
in practice mode, learning and trying to perform the same moves used by
the computer, and some just by chance.

If you happen to see any move(s) listed in this FAQ that are actually
listed in the command lists within the U.S. version of the Tekken Tag
Tournament PS2 game, please e-mail me and tell me the name of the move
in my FAQ and/or the in-game movelist.

You will receive credit for noticing commands like this whenever I
create the next version of this FAQ.  You will also receive credit for
noticing any typos or any other mistakes with the commands.  Thank you
in advance.

IMPORTANT: When sending an e-mail, please put something about "Tekken"
or "FAQ" somewhere in the e-mail topic, or the e-mail will be deleted.

Select Tetsujin and Unknown
---------------------------
After unlocking Tetsujin and Unknown, they cannot be viewed in most
modes as selectable fighters.  Tetsujin is in an empty space to the
left of Wang, and Unknown is in the empty space to the right of Roger.



=============================
       Special Outfits

the Start" or "Tag" button.


Play as Gold Tetsujin

Win 10 consecutive matches in "Versus battle" or "1 on 1 Versus"

win streak is broken, or Versus mode is exited.

Another way is to win 10 consecutive matches in "Survival Mode" with
Tetsujin as one of the members of the tag team.  Then for the rest
of Survival mode, Tetsujin will be gold until you are defeated.



=============================
      Other Unlockables
=============================


Unlock Theater Mode
-------------------
Beat story mode with any fighter.


Unlock Ling's 2nd Movie
-----------------------
Beat "Arcade" mode when selecting Ling as the first fighter in her
schoolgirl outfit.


Unlock Tekken Bowl
------------------
When you unlock True Ogre, this mode is unlocked as well.


Unlock Embu #2
--------------
Unlock Unknown and you will be able to see an embu starring the animals
of Tekken Tag.


Unlock Gallery Mode
-------------------
Unlock Unknown and you will be able to get screen captures from a
match by pausing the game and selecting "Screen Capture".



=============================
        Cool Secrets
=============================


Begin Match with Second Fighter
-------------------------------
To start off the match with the second selected fighter, hold down
the tag button until the player intros begin.


Devil Kazuya
------------
Picking Kazuya and Devil as partners will give you a special tag
team where Kazuya can transform into Devil and vise-versa.  The
down side of this tag team is that they can only transform while
they are standing up.


Unknowns Hidden Power
----------------------
If you have an Analog controller, then you have access to Unknowns
Hidden Power.  Unlike any other fighter, Unknown has the ability to
change her fighting style at her own free will.  If you decide that
you want to take on a different fighters fighting style, then press
the R3 button while in a match.  Unknown will randomly choose a
fighting style to imitate.


Play as an Unlocked Fighter
------------------------------
In "Arcade", "Practice", "Versus", or "Tekken Bowl" mode, choose the
"Random" icon until you get a fighter that is not unlocked yet.  If
you don't get a new fighter, just press the "Select" button and try
again. This fighter will be the next fighter that you can unlock
during "Arcade" mode.  You can use them before you unlock them, but
the fighter won't be listed until they are actually unlocked.


Scrambled Circuits
------------------
These are fighters that will go "berserk" after being hit by one of
Devil's laser beams:
Gun Jack, Jack-2, P. Jack


Fire Retardant
--------------
These are fighters that will barely be fazed when hit by True Ogre's
fire blast (i.e. they still stand after being hit):
Bryan Fury, Gun Jack, Jack-2, P. Jack


Noise Pollution
---------------
If you hold the down button the on the controller before the match begins,
then you will be able to hear Tetsujin making clanking noises whenever he
is hit or when he blocks.  Mokujin will make claning and wood chop sounds.
NOTE: The sound effect ends as soon as the match is over.



=============================
        Glitch / Error
=============================


Practice Mode Glitch
--------------------
In practice mode, if you select Eddy Gordo as your opponent, the
damage meter will continue to increase until Eddy gets knocked to the
ground.


Error in Movelist Demo
----------------------
In the practice mode command list demo, you will see that Ling performs
the "Sunflower Wake Up Call" instead of the "Sunflower".



=============================
            Other
=============================


In-Game Reset
-------------
Press "start" and "select" simultaneously to return to the Menu
screen at any time, except while in the Options menu and at the
load screens.

In practice mode, you can have a move repeated continuously by first
recording it with the command capture, then by playing it with
"SELECT + SQUARE" buttons.

The results of Team Battle can be repeated by pressing the select
button.

                          16. Tekken Bowl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The Tekken Bowl FAQ was my 3rd FAQ of the Tekken series, however it was
never released outside of the Tekkenomics website.  My first two FAQs were
both Hidden Moves FAQs for Tekken 4 and Tekken Tag Tournament.

Since Tekken Bowl is one of the best mini-games included in the Tekken
series, I decided to put together a FAQ of info and some things that
might aid in enhancing someone's experience with Tekken Bowl.

This section is designed for beginners to Tekken Bowl, but can be used by
anyone.  This section will contain information about bowling in general.

This section only covers the PS2 Tekken Tag Tournament (U.S. Version) and
may be used for other PS2 Versions of Tekken Tag, but I only worked with
the U.S. Version.

What is Tekken Bowl?
Tekken Bowl is an unlockable mini-game included in Tekken Tag Tournament
that allows you to play the sport of bowling with your favorite Tekken
Tag Fighters.

Bowling FAQ" by Wazuya on GameFAQs:

related to Tekken Bowl.

Unlock Jukebox
--------------
To unlock the Jukebox, get at least 200 points in one bowling match.



=============================
            Other
=============================


In-Game Reset
-------------
Press "start" and "select" simultaneously to return to the Menu
screen at any time, except during the load screen.


Ambidextrous Bowlers
--------------------
Press the "Select" button to switch between right and left handed.
This works for the following bowlers:
Baek Doo San (Left Handed Default)
Hwoarang (Right Handed Default)


Over Charge
-----------
When you're up to bowl and you get the charge meter one level above
its maximum level, then your bowler will throw the ball, along with
theirself, at the pins and you will get a foul.


Time Up
-------
If you're up to bowl and you do not throw the ball after 5 minutes
have passed, then your bowler will throw the ball, along with
theirself, at the pins and you will get a foul (similar to an Over
Charge).


Mokujin See, Mokujin Do
-----------------------
If Tetsujin / Mokujin is selected as the second bowler, they will
copy the pose of their partner when there is a strike.  However, if
the partner is Unknown, then the pose will be random.
Unknown will always copy Jun's poses.


Radar Vision
------------
The following bowlers have a special radar when they bowl:
Bryan Fury, Gun Jack, Jack-2, Prototype Jack, Yoshimitsu


Knock out Dr. B
---------------
You can see Dr. B on your left hand side at the bowling alley.  You
can throw the ball at him and knock him out by moving your bowler all
the way over to the left side of the lane, then look towards him before
you throw the ball.  You should hear a "K.O.", acknowledging that you
were successful.  You can also knock out other spectators.  Just move
your bowler over to the side of the alley that they're on before you
throw the ball.



=============================
            Hints
=============================


Strikes with Lei
----------------
A good way to get strikes with Lei Wulong, or any medium-speed
bowler, is to move a little to the left before you throw the ball.
Then make sure that the "Ball Spin" is in the middle, or a little
to the right.  Then make sure that your speed is almost full.  You
may not get a strike every time, but a good majority of the pins
will get knocked down.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


In this section, I will try my best to answer questions that I have
received through e-mail.


----------
Question 1 - TTT on PS3 issues
----------

Q: I have an 80GB PS3 and when I play TTT, it runs really slowly.  Do you
   know anything about this?

A: I also have the 80GB PS3 with PS2 backwards compatibility and I am
   experiencing the same slowness problem.  This is a known issue and is
   displayed at the link below under "80GB PLAYSTATION3 Model CECHE01":
   http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/CompatibleStatus
   TTT should work fine on the original 20GB/60GB models.  The new
   PS3 models don't have PS2 backwards compatibility and will not be
   able to play TTT,

                        19. About Tekkenomics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The main purpose of "Tekkenomics" is to provide you with Tekken FAQs/Guides
and to keep you updated on Tekken news and information.

"Tekkenomics" was originally the name of the website created by me
(Wild Man X), with help from Paulinstein and Drake the Demon, which first
came online on November 6, 2004.  However, due to someone engaging in
piracy on our hosting server the website went down in April 2007.  With
the release of Tekken 6 approaching for consoles, I decided to bring back
Tekkenomics, but in the form of a blog back in June 2009.

"Tekkenomics" contains various Tekken related material, some of which is
difficult to find on any other Tekken based website.  The blog will
contain exclusive articles, original FAQ files, move lists, combos/juggles,
combo videos, in-game matches, Tekken commercials, PC desktop wallpaper,
PSP wallpaper, CG art, fan-based material, and other things.

If you're having problems visiting the "Tekkenomics Blog" at
http://www.tekkenomics.com, then you can also visit it at the following
link: http://tekkenomics.wordpress.com

If you were wondering how we came up with the name "Tekkenomics", back in
my high school days in the year 2000, Paulinstein, me, and some other high
school friends would get together to play Tekken 3 on the PlayStation 1.
At the time, we were also enrolled in Economics. Whenever we would get
together to play, we would say that we were going to study some
"Tekkenomics".  So, basically: "Tekken" + "Economics" = "Tekkenomics".

There are a few references on the web to the name "Tekkenomics" that
aren't related to us or our blog.  There are some members on the Tekken
Zaibatsu forums that go by the names "Tekkenomics", "Tekkenomics_101",
and "TekkenNomics Jr." that aren't related to us. On Tekken Zaibatsu,
we go by the names "Wild Man X", "Paulinstein", and "Drake the Demon".
The things on the web that ARE related to us are at: GameFAQs, Neoseeker,
IGN, 1UP.com, Gamerhelp, Gamespot, MySpace, AIM, MSN Messenger, Hotmail,
GMail, YouTube, PicasaWeb, Blogger, WordPress, ImageShack, and Twitter.

                       20. About The Author
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I have been a fan of the Tekken series since 2000.  A few of my friends
got me into the series with Tekken 3.

My first FAQ was "Hidden Moves" for Tekken 4.  Writing this FAQ, I've
learned some new things about Tekken along the way that I probably
wouldn't have learned otherwise.  My FAQs are a way for me to share
what I have learned.

Lei Wulong is my main fighter, and has been since Tekken 3.  When I bought
Tekken Tag Tournament for the PS2, I decided to learn how to play with all
of the fighters, and this has carried over to Tekken 4, Tekken 5, and
Tekken: Dark Resurrection.  So, you can rest assured that I do atleast
know a little bit about what I'm talking about :)

I am currently residing in Southern California (in the United States),
but have not been to any of the arcades in the area in a long time.  I
used to play at the University of California, Riverside.

I hope that you've enjoyed my FAQs!
