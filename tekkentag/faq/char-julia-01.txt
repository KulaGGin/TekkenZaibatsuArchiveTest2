This FAQ is targetted at readers of all level, beginner thru
intermediate thus the title "A Players Guide to JULIA CHANG".
Throughout writing this FAQ, we found that co-writing an FAQ for Julia
would have its pro's and con's. Having two authours, the reader can
easily see the difference in opinion players will have with certain
moves and strategy. We hope that by co-authouring this FAQ, we would be
able to bring to you a diverse and different methods to approach
playing Julia. Remember, No two players are the same. We have written
this FAQ in such a way that you can easily look up info on a certain
topic which you need to refresh on. For instance, if you want to know
more about Julia's 1~1,1 just go to her "Move Analysis" section to read
about its uses. Likewise if you want to know more about setting up her
1~1,1 then refer to her "Poking and Custom strings" section. This
method provides for easier reference and is not as confusing in the
long run unlike certain faq (Hint: RevC) We hope you will enjoy this
FAQ as we have writing it.

Whats New?

v1.0 - This is it. The release of the FAQ. We hope that it will provide
       sufficient information. As always should there be any errors or
       new tricks discovered, we will undoubtedly make revisions to the
       FAQ.

About Dayful
------------
I'm 18 I live on the outskirts of Liverpool in England, I'm curently
studying A levels in Chemistry and computer science. First time I
played tekken was just when Tekken 1 first came out on the PS1, it
wasn't mine I just went to one of my friends houses and I sucked at it
anyway. I started playing a lot more when T3 came out once I had a
playstation of my own and had nothing better to do than go to the
arcades. Using Julia as my first character was an easy choice for me
realy she's easily the best looking character (IMO of course). The only
problem there was Julia was very difficult to use but I wasn't going to
give up even though I sucked. Now I'm playing TTT a lot as I'm one of
the lucky people in the UK who actualy managed to get a PS2 (slow as
shit sadly). Also I played in the arcades for over a year with the
constant motivation to show everyone Julia didn't suck (Peope in the UK
got duped in to thinking Ling was something special and Julia got
ignored by most people). I spend most of my time playing in Casears in
Southport, hopefully soon I'll be going to the Trafford centre a lot.
So if you see a guy playing Julia, Yoshi, True Ogre, Kazuya, Bruce and
Armor King it may be me. I'm not an expert player but I feel I'm able
to give good advice to any one who wants to play Julia.

About iLuvMomo

I am an 18 year old boy who lives in Ipoh, a small town in Malaysia.
I have moved to KL, studying my second year in A levels at Taylors
College. I would consider myself a hardcore gamer and have been playing
games in the arcades since I was 6 playing the then popular Street
Fighter II series (the ironic thing about this all is that people under
18 are banned from going to arcades!... so you would say I had to
illegally sneak into arcades time and time again) Anyways, back to the
topic. My first taste of Tekken was Tekken 2 on the Playstation and I
have to say I never liked it in the first place. (to slow for me) I
really got into Tekken when Tekken 3 was released for the Playstation,
and I addictively play Tekken Tag Tournament right now, spending most
of my allowance in the local arcades learning new combos or practising
new strategies. If any of you readers live in Ipoh (or KL for the
matter), do e-mail me as I would be glad to have a game or two with
you. When I am in Ipoh, I always hang out at Capcom Station in Jaya
Jusco during the weekends from 2-6pm. It doesn't matter if you are
better than me and if you beat me because if you do , I will still be
learning something new. Anyways, I am NOT a player with Mad skillz,
just an average player who wishes to pass a tip or two to would-be
Julia Players. Writing this FAQ has not been easy as one would think
since it invovles a lot of time and patience. This FAQ has gone through
numerous revisions to make it better for you the reader. I hope you
will therefore enjoy reading it.

Why a Julia Chang FAQ?
**********************

Dayful's View
-------------
Well she's my favorite character (Blatantly obvious to anyone on TZ)
and I feel that a character of her quality defianately deserves a realy
good FAQ. At the moment the only FAQ involving Julia is the
Julia/Michelle one which doesn't go in to enough depth pretty strange
seen as there are countless Jin FAQ's and a few other charcters have
many FAQ's as well. Also of all the types of scrubs you can come across
Julia scrubs are among the worst as she isn't easy to use giving some
people the wrong impression of her. Hopefuly as well as helping the
many Julia players out there get the best out of her it will put an end
to the people who still live in the early T3 days when people thought
she was weak. LOL it's blatantly obvious when you think about it realy
she is overpowerd but few people can use her properly. A lot of people
think abuse mad axes and elbows and you will be fine well that's why
they still suck. Julia is a very deep character and hopefuly this guide
will show people how to get the best out of her.

This is my second attempt at writing an FAQ. When I first wrote my
Kazuya FAQ I was quite new to FAQ writing and never discussed much
strategy be it at forums or on IRC. Needless to say, there were
numerous mistakes in the FAQ. Fastforward almost ONE whole year since
the release of my initial FAQ to this one. Over the period of time, I
have learnt a lot on FAQ writing, and also loads of new tricks from the
pros and fellow players alike. Besides the lack of an FAQ solely on
Julia, I feel that a lot of players do not use Julia to the fullest of
her capabilities. The reason I am writing this FAQ is much like when I
wrote my Kazuya FAQ, to promote other lesser used moves of Julia and
provide a different view from the "Boring Boring Changs" label which is
fixed on Julia. I am so sick of seeing Chang scrubs all around who do
nothing but mixups. Most parts of my FAQ have been written from scratch
except for certain sections where I have been too lazy and just copied
relevant details from my own Kazuya FAQ. I know that some of my ideas
may prove to be radical to people, but before you start flaming me,
just consider the countless nights I spent staying up till 4 a.m. to
make sure that this Julia gets the best FAQ treatment.


****************
Why Julia Chang?
****************

She is a top tier character, 'nuff said. LOL. Julia is a great pitbull
character. She can be played in a boring manner or very interestingly
(using her lesser used moves) both which are effective. Although she
tends to rely a lot on her CH moves, she has the right bunch of tools
to drive turtlers to near insanity. Her quick pokes will keep even the
Mishima's on their toes because they cannot get careless with their
pokes. Speaking of her CH moves, they do a lot by themselves, but
better still lead to easy extremely damaging juggles that rival 's
cheese knees. Her Mad axes is prolly the best throw in the game, if not
THE throw of any fighting game, period and she has the command low
parry which creates one of the best confusion in the game. No character
even comes close to her when it comes to usefulness of her command low
parry. Julia's universal parry is also augmented by powerful GURANTEED
follow ups which depletes almost half of your opponent's life. Movement
is also a key to any players game, and fortunately for Julia, she has
great movement with her double/ triple sidestep. More often that not,
this double/triple sidestep will allow Julia to get behind her opponent
for loads of free stuff. Also, being a small character, her opponents
will find juggling Julia extremely hard. Some combos that will hit
other small characters will even whiff Julia. She packs this all in one
good package by also having better stamina than her mother, Michelle...
not to mention Netsu friendliness with a lot of characters.

Why not her then? Julia is not without her weaknesses. A good Julia
player will know that she has no single launching move like WGF or
power hits like Deathfist. Her elbows can hardly be considered a
powerhit even though it is quick, safe and knockdowns since it does
pitiful damage. Neither can her hopkick or df+2,1 be considered good
launching moves because they either are to slow to initiate or have
extremely bad recovery time. Also if your opponent is a very good
turtler, Julia is very SCREWED in her gameplay. Of course you can say
that not everyone can turtle well against Julia, not when Mad Axes is
10 frames away. And of course if you want to nitpick, Julia does not
have as much stamina as T.Ogre or Kings.


************************
Changes to Julia from T3
************************

RedKing did a similar section in his Jin FAQ and I feel it can be
useful for anyone who played T3 Julia and hasn't yet played TTT Julia.
Overall Julia is definitely a much easier to use character than she was
in T3, she still isn't easy but getting the best out of T3 Julia is
very difficult although if you have d,d/f+1 down you're a long way
there as most of her very powerful combos in T3 depended on it. Well I
think the biggest difference to Julia is the huge improvement to her
elbow, it recovers much faster and is much safer to throw out now and
increaces her ability ot presure her opponent as she couldn't do much
safely after her elbow in T3. Her juggles are far easier to use now
with the adition of her mountian chrusher it does a handy 28 damage on
its own and can be used as juggle ender.
Her elbows recover much faster and allows her to get in a lot more
elbows. 6 elbows isn't that difficult to do (IMHO), in T3 she could get
in two elbows then they could tech roll which was pathetic. Considering
when the tech roll is taken off in practice you can hit 7 elbows on the
big characters it's a bit sad realy. The juggle propeties of her d,d/f+
1,2 have been changed as well it can now be used as a juggle ender
which is great but you can't use it at the beginning of juggles now If
it had stayed like that her juggle damage would have probobly broke 50
damage, her main juggle weapon for T3 would be F+2,d,d/f+1,2 that did a
nasty 26 damage on it's own add in the significant increase in elbows
and her wonder juggle would have been obsolete, but it can't sadly so
don't think it's an improvement it isn't.
Also very significantly her command low parry has been butchered the
best you get now is an u/f+4 off a parried low kick and that's not
always garunteed. Anyone who played Julia in T3 knows the deal she had
a garunteed u/f+4 and juggle of a parried low jab and d/f+2,1 off a
parried low kick, hell even f+1 was gaunteed off a parried low kick and
that's pretty slow. Julia's okizemie is now much better due to the
mountian chrusher more specifically the d/f+4 it has very good range
and will float your opponent if they roll for some very good damage.
The d/f+4 is a vital move for Julia IMO due to the increase in range
from T3. Also it doesn't push your opponent away making it a much
better set up tool. One small difference to mention 2+3 is not sm not
low so I'm sure you realise this is completely crap now.

Before starting Julia's wonder juggle is d+1_d+2,d/f+4,3,d/f+4,2,b>f+1
as I can't be bothered typing it as it's referred to constantly. I
don't see why it's named the wonder juggle and I don't know who started
it it does craploads of damage but Jin's scrubby lazer cannon juggles
do just as much.


Throws
-------

Command          Name                         Escape

1+3              Death Valley Bomb            1
<iLuvMomo>
Well this is one of Julia's 1+3 throw. The special thing about this
throw is that it does 35 points of damage which is 5 more than your
normal throws (not including King). Besides after the Death Valley
Bomb, you are guranteed d+3 to raise the damage up even more to 47.
This throw is also a very good setup for OB traps. For those who don't
know what is OB trap, it is a method of baiting your opponent so that
they will get up with an attack which you promptly interrupt with a d+1
to backturn them (and thus score subsequent free hits). Overall, the
Death Valley Bomb is certainly one of the better throws that Julia has.
Its downfall is its easy escape (1 which most scrubs default to) and
the huge escape frame for breaking (you can break it as long as you
input 1 before your Julia gets you on her shoulders) You might have to
switch to other throws, since most opponents default to 1 as their
instinctive throw break.

<DayFul>
Even though it's a 1 break which is the most commonly escaped throw
it's still very good it's does 35 and a garunteed d+3 so the damage is
pretty dam good. You must use this throw even if its easy to escape as
all of Julia most useful/damaging throws are a 1+2 escape. This and
Julia's other basic throw are excellentfor OB traps as explained above.
I personly use this throw fairly often as overall the damage is better
than mad axes so even though it's easy to eascape it's worth using just
to make mad axes even more of a headache.


2+4              Fisherman's Suplex           2
<iLuvMomo>
The fisher mans's suplex is your "other" generic throw. It does 5
points less damage though you can prolly follow up with d+3 (which is
not guranteed by any extent) Use this only if your other throws are
being broken because it certainly isn't one of the best throws that
Julia has.

<DayFul>
Not as much damage but still you have a garunteed d+3 (Not sure but you
have better options anyway). And as mentioned in the 1+3 description
this is excellent for OB traps. Basic throws are easy to escape but
most of the time your opponent will need to expect mad axes Or else
they will struggle to break it, hell it's hard to break anyway so as I
said it's very important to mixup your throws to make mad axes even
more of a pain.


d,DB+1+3         Front Suplex                 1

<iLuvMomo>
Why on Earth would Julia want to use this move?  For one thing, it does
5 points less than DVB and has the same break button (1) So unless you
are a dumb ass, you'd rather stick to DVB for easier and more damaging
throw. The command for this throw just doesn't make this throw worth
doing especially in a tight battle.

<DayFul>
Well this is sad it's inferior to death valley bomb in every way. Add
to what iLuvMomo said to make this even worse you have no garunteed
followups whlie DVB has an ideal OB trap situation. it doesn't even
look that good keep far away from this one.


b+2(~5)          Arm Whip (tag)               d
<iLuvMomo>
Worthless, since your opponent (assuming he knows anything bout tekken)
can easily escape the tag out to Michelle. This is not one of the
better (and safer) tag throws you'd wish for. Stay clear from it. Oh
yeah, btw, this works like a charm on the computer, even on Ultra hard
mode... thats if you can get b+2 to connect.

<DayFul>
Well in one way it sucks ass badly but once your opponent knows they
have to duck to escape you could mix this up with d+1 which will result
in a very damaging OB trap. Don't use it often but it can realy be a
pain in the ass if you use it right.


df+1+2           Armlock suplex               1+2
<iLuvMomo>
This is a good throw to use in close (and to mix up with DVB) since it
is a double break throw. Besides it does very good damage (37 pts) and
is a very easy double break command throw. The downfall is this throw
is prolly its poor range (its range is even less than her generic
throws!) and the fact that the window for breaking this throw is larger
than that of Mad Axes. Use this only if you are tired of seeing mad
axes for the 58321681254th time.

<DayFul>
It's a bit more powerful than her basic throws sadly the reach is poor.
It can catch people who get up off the floor and recover standing (In
fear of d/f+2 which you realy don't want to get hit by) but 1+2 is a
very common escape for Julia. One strange feature this has is that the
grab is for a right throw so if your opponent looks at the throw
animation for the escape You can trick them in to this well (Thanks to
Notti for pointing that out to me). Then on the flip side of the coin
your opponent may be wary of that it can completely confuse there throw
escapes and this and 2+4 can create an extra throw headache along with
mad axes. This also has garunteed followups I.e d+3. And this is also
very good for OB traps. This is best incorporated in to Julia's running
game as she has two fast mid hitting moves and you opponent realy has
to block and try to escape the grab unless they want to eat the running
1 or 2.


FC,db,d,db+1+2   Cross Arm Suplex             1+2
<iLuvMomo>
This throw is an excellent throw to pull out of FC position and is
almost similar to King's DDT. It does 45 pts damage and has a double
break. Use this throw like you would use Kazuya's WS+2 - after ducking
scrubby high attacks like ermm.... Hwoarang's 3,3,3,3 (last hit can be
ducked you stupid scrubs) d+4,4, 1,1,3,3, Mishima's 1,2,2 or anything
which gives you an opportunity to get into FC position. Besides that
you prolly can get into FC position via the recovery of your Party
crasher, f,f+1 (more on that later) which is used to good effect by
Shafi in the World tourney (FYI its shafi vs nappi 4) After the Cross
Arm Suplex, you are guranteed at least a d+3 or b+3 or other okizeme
attacks, since your opponent is very close to you (and to the side).

<DayFul>
It has limited oppourtunites for use but when you hit it the damage is
very good it has a garunteed d+3 with you opponent off axis. But why do
d+3 when your opponent must either roll to the side or stand up I
normaly use d+4,1 to flip them over sadly the face down tech roll has
ruined the d+4,N+4 followup to that she had in T3 which took the damage
to 80+. Actualy this gives you such a big advantage you could try and
SS so that your opponent is in PLD and d+1 for an OB trap the SS is
pretty good bait to get your opponent up. You can play the fake low
parry game very well with this and seen as Julia has a lot of mixups in
it (high, mid, low she has everything covered here, too many options).
You can tick this in to d+1 easily (Among others I'll get in to that
later). Looks very painfull too.


QCB<F+2          Mad Axes                     1+2
<iLuvMomo>
Abuse this move, thats all I can say. It is the sole reason why Julia
is anywhere near Michelle. Mad asses, as I like to call it, is just so
damn good a move that I can't stop thinking of its Pros. Come on....
its the best throw in the entire game and also in the entire history of
tekken if you want any reason to use it. For one it is just so damn
bufferable into any attack. Buffer it into 1, WS+1, f,f+1, d,df+1,
d+1+3 heck even 1~1 anything! Second this throw has such an INSANE
range that it surely puts King's long arms and G. Swing to shame.
Third, you can delay it so much so you can do a sidestep, dash in or
just pause (go to neutral) before initiating the throw, which of course
gives the throw more mobility. The neutral pause also adds to the
throw's deceptiveness. Dashing during the motion of this throw gives
the throw even MORE range than it has naturally, and sidestepping adds
to its evasiveness. Moreover, this throw is the fastest throw to
initiate (in terms of frames) which is at 10 frames and has the
smallest escape window possible (if I remember correctly its 5 frames).
And damn... its even double break! Even good players find it hard to
escape this throw unless they expect it coming. Heck I think you prolly
have to be pressing 1+2 when the throw connects to have any chance to
break this damn throw. You'd think a throw such as this which is so
good has a catch in the damage? Well NO. It does very decent damage
which amounts to 42 fat points (3 points short of the harder to do
Cross Arm Suplex) However, there is no guranteed okizeme attack after
the Mad axes but you can of course run towards your opponent and set up
other things. More on that later. The only bad thing about this throw
is, if you do sidestep during the throw, you could end up with a side
throw. Why is that bad you ask? Side throws are easily escaped by good
players. Oh and if your opponent starts breaking from Mad Axes you
really KNOW your gameplan is going right down the drain and you need to
get some FRESH setups.

<DayFul>
Best throw in the game by a mile IMHO I'll argue that with anyone
unless they are a scrub (Actualy I will argue with them but they don't
understand the huge advantages this has). Mad axes is very fast 10
frames which is as fast as the Mishimas jabs. The range on mad axes is
just plain unfair you would expect a character with Julia's short arms
to have poor throw range but that isn't the case. This looks so cool
and it takes a long time to execute very annoying for your opponent and
a reat time waster. Mad axes can be used in Julias game very easily you
can buffer it in to pretty much any move Julia has (There's a section
dedicated to that later expect it to getbigger and bigger with every
update ;p). As well as her different moves you can buffer this in to
spins and backdashes (Very good one the reach of mad axes makes that
possible). If someone tries to punish a backdash throw them out of
whatever they tried to do. LOL you can even buffer mad axes in to
blocked moves same with her FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 on low attacks. If you're
brave buffer this in one of Baek's kick strings and find a window where
you can throw him out of it. You can use this in the fake low parry
guessing game but for that purpose I would rather use FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2
which overall will do much more damage. Mad axes does some decent
damage (42) her other throws have a bigger payoff potentially but this
hits much more often due to the speed and tiny escape window. This is
an excellent way to get plenty of easy damage which is why she realy
doesn't need a power shot, other from her CH's throws are an excellent
source of damage for Julia. Mad axes has no garunteed followups but she
has her very good running game to get in to. BTW can't agree for a
second about the Michelle comment there's lots more advantagesother
than mad axes.


1+3_2+4_2+5      Running Bulldog              1
<iLuvMomo>
Normal left side throw. Does 40 points of damage, easily broken by good
players but looks kinda flashy. Unless your opponent doesn't know how
to break throws, stick with SS, 1~1,1 or the likes.

<DayFul>
Nothing special to look at (IMHO of course), no garunteed followups and
easily escaped, use 1~1,1 or f+1+2 please it hurts more.


1+3_2+4_2+5      Spinning Frankensteiner      2
<iLuvMomo>
45 pts of damage which is a lot for a right side throw. Looks real cool
but sadly like all side throws, is easily broken. After sidestepping to
your right I feel it is best for you to use 1~1,1 or maybe f+1+2 than
go for an easily broken throw.

<DayFul>
The damage is good but sidethrows are very easy to escape as you have
no guessing game normaly. However I do use this in some okizemie
situations if you run up to your opponent and throw you may hit this
instead of d/f+1+2 but the potential escape confusion is a bit
redundant that d/f+1+2 has a right throw animaton. So realy I mainly
get this by accident other than that you have better moves off the SS.


1+3_2+4_2+5      Spinning Air Neckbreaker     n/a
<iLuvMomo>
The Spinning Air Neck breaker is Julia's back throw and is inescapable.
Does a cool 50 points of damage, which isn't much compared to the
damage done by Ogre, Yoshi, Heihachi etc. Still, with Julia's superior
SS ability, you will prolly be getting behind your opponent a lot.
Anyways here is a tip to set up Julia's back throw. After any launch,
lets say f+1, wiff a move (standing punch, 1 works great). If your
opponent should tech roll and rise with an attack, then sidestep in the
opposite direction and grab him. Lo and Behold... a back throw. Anyways
to see this example in action download the a1 Japan Honor Videos at
s8n's (look for the website under the webpage section) Although this is
done by Michelle in stead of Julia (and I feel it was more of a
coincidence than anything else), it still works the same. However it is
better served that you do 4,4,1 than risk a back throw since the back
throw can be ducked.

<DayFul>
Inescapabe and it looks so cool even mad axes can't touch this if a
little unlikely to happen (People do say yea right when they see this).
50 damage isn't bad and with Julias 3xSS you can get this once in a
while. Whenever you use this do remember you could have used
4,4,1,f,f,N+1,1,d+4,1 just remember that.


Basic Arts:
-----------

*Note* Only selected moves are chosen here to be commented on. It would
       proof redundant to comment on all her hopkick variations.

Command                 Name                          Range    Property

1                       Standing Left Jab             H
<iLuvMomo>
Julia's best poke move. If you don't use this in ANY Julia game, quit
her and play someone else. This is where all your CH's will come from,
and at 8 frames (which is the fastest other than Yoshi flash) you WILL
gain a lot of CH's from it when it interrupts your opponent.
Interrupting is only one thing. A standing 1 is also setup for her
throws as well as a quick tick move for Julia.

<DayFul>
Julia's basic jab at 8 frames is among the fastest in the game, this
gives her a very big advantage against characters witout an 8 frame jab
as you canget CH's considerably easier. The main strength of this is if
it counterhits, your opponent can say goodbye to around 60% of there
life and that's without netsu. It's also very easy to buffer mad axes
off this (I'll be sorting out all the mixups with this later as a mad
axes setup). You can be pretty safe throwing out a couple of jabs in
succesion, sadly this gives no frame advantage when blocked like Law or
Bruce but you can still setup some stuff. Hell buffer mad axes in to a
blocked 1 as well there's no frame disadvantage and if your opponent
ducks you have the mid hitting 1 followup (That's a simple minded idea
I'll be going for a safer followup later which gives even more
advantages).


2                       Standing Right Jab            H
<iLuvMomo>
Often overlooked by even some of the best Julia players, because of its
inability to produce mass damage and being a tad slower than her left
punch. In most cases, I would say the right punch is pretty useless and
should not be used when you could use a left punch except if your
opponent has 10 frames or more disadvantage and is very close to you.
Should it hit, you can either link with b to go to his back (not
advisable) or buffer a throw (mad axes again) since you have 9 frames
of advantage. If he does ANYTHING but duck, he will be thrown.

<DayFul>
No where near as deadly as her 1 but it does give you a +9 frame
advantage making mad axes easy to hit. I think you actualy have to
buffer this in to the recovery of the 2, I sometimes find myself
buffering mad axes in to the jab and getting her spin behind which
sucks so make sure you avoid buffering it at the wrong time. Also using
F+2 is my choice first hit when juggling you can easily get d,d/f+1
after this to bring up the damage. I find that so easy to mess up this
gives you a bit more air time to get it right. also it does one more
point of damage than f,f,N+1 anyway.


d+1                     Low Jab                       sM
<iLuvMomo>
Most important move in the game and a move you can't live without. It
sets up Julia's FC mix up game. It interrupts all those annoying 10
strings with ease. It stops WGF dead in its tracks (assuming you time
it right). It is goddamn 8 frames. It is excellent in OB traps. It is
so useful in Okizeme. It is DA Move of the game. It is off course none
other than d+1. If it hits, you gain +9 frames advantage, so you might
want to buffer a FC,db,d,DB+1+2 throw to capitalize on the situation.
Again if your opponent does ANYTHING but duck, he will be thrown.

<DayFul>
Well now Julia's low parry is wrecked d+1 is no longer dangerous to use
as a poke. Anyway enough bitternes d+1 as iLuvMomo said the most
important move in the game it interupts pretty much everything and it's
safe even when parried your opponent has nothing more than a d+1 if
there not of axis. It's also a very easy way to get in to FC and it
gives you a +9 frame advantage so at worst you can hit another d+1 or
go in to er FC mixup. Do be wary though use too many of these and a
fellow Julia player for example could stick a CH 4 on you this will
happen if your opponent tries to d+1 and you beat them to the 4 this is
more commonly seen with Willimas players who use lots of strings with
d+1,N+4 after a blocked move of course (Will they ever learn?).


WS+1                    Standing Left Jab             m
<iLuvMomo>
Many players ignore this move of Julia because of her other more
damaging options, but at least in my gameplay, I don't. There will be a
lot of situations where you need a faster poke to outpoke your
opponent, and this is it. WS+1 acts like Kazuya's WS+1 of his twin
pistons, with equally short range, but FASTER! If she wiffs it, it
recovers pretty fast and she is safe. If it is blocked you are
completely safe, and should it hit you get 8 frames of advantage which
is ideal to buffer Mad Axes or any other throw. WS+1 is guranteed after
blocking certain moves like King's f+2+3 shoulder ram for example.

<DayFul>
Well I never realy notice this move much but I do find myself using it
as it's very safe sounds weird? well it just flows in to my gameplay
realy it's not something I think about. I usually use this when I'm in
FC and I don't see an oppourtunity to use her FC mixups or I need to
interupt. It's a very good mad axes buffer if it hits but the range is
poor but even if you whiffs you can't be punished.


4                       Standing High Kick            h        JGc
<iLuvMomo>
Even though this isn't listed under her move list, I feel that her
standing 4 is still a very good good move to be mentioned here. Also it
deserves more recognition than its crappier 4,4,X variations. The kick
is one of the fastest move (other than her d+1 and standing 1) at 10
frames. On CH, like all other high kicks, it juggles and Julia can get
a free 4,(4),4 or f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, d,df+1,2 combo.  Pop out this
move once in a while since it has more range than her standard 1, has
very good priority and is bound to catch a lot of pitbull players on
CH. 4 is pretty much abusable. You could just stand outside jab range
and try 2 or 3 of these consecutively without being punished usually.
Also because of its speed, you will rarely see opponents duck it unless
of course you do 10 of these in a row.

<DayFul>
A 10 frame kick 20 damage on normal hit and it's pretty easy to connect
with and you have a free 35 damage juggle on CH making for a nice 65
damage. It's safe when blocked and gives a nice frame advantage (+4) on
normal hit you can buffer mad axes in to this resulting in some very
good damage, you need to move forward VERY slightly for it to connect
however. This can link it to the spining kick strings but you wan't to
train yourself out of using them as good player will parry the second
hit often. Also this kills d+1 for a free CH for a so called safe move
as I explained in the d+1 description.


WS+4                    Skyscraper Kick               m        KD
<iLuvMomo>
I wonder why Zaibatsu never put this move in Julia's Special arts since
it definitely does not act like other character's WS+4. If it connects,
your opponent will be knocked down and you can get a free d+4. Plus you
will be in FC position and should your opponent move you can get a free
FC,df+4,3 combo. Although some may think it is so, WS+4 properties
differ from f,f+(1),4 properties since you can't do her elbow juggles
after the WS version of the skyscraper kick. The skyscraper kick also
comes out relatively fast and although the frame suggests that it
recovers poorly at -17 frames, done at the correct distance, it will
push your opponent away to avoid any major damage done. Of course long
pokes and certain powermoves (like Bryan's Mach Punch or Jin's f,f+2)
are still guranteed. If you are in FC position and want a mid hitting
attack and yet fear the long recovery of FC,df+2, use the Skyscraper
kick instead. Otherwise, I'd stick with WS+1 any day.

<DayFul>
The only drawback to this is if this is blocked up close Julia will get
raped, at maximum distance this will push your opponent away and leave
you safe from retaliation apart from long pokes like Kuma's f+1 and
some fast power shots. Also as iLuvMomo said you can get in an FC,d/f+
4,3 if they move and an MC on the end for some very good damage. This
is very fast 11 frames and has excellent priority and suprisingly good
range range. It can be sidestepped just don't use it up close unless
you are certain it will hit. I actualy find this most useful when you
use it from instant WS there are a number of methods that people use, I
personaly use d~d/f it seems a bit more natural that way you can use
d~d/b or d~b there's more as well but there the most common ones. You
can use this of the fake low parry it's one of the moves you should be
using most frequently off it.


uf+4                    Hopkick                       m        JG
<iLuvMomo>
Another standard move of Julia's which should be given recognition.
Julia's hopkick is prolly one of the best in the business (bar the
Kings of course) It has good priority (like most of Julia's moves btw)
comes out quite fast and the potential damage she can do after the
hopkick is quite unfair. Just ask Dayful and he will go on all day
about Julia's wonder combo. If there is one thing so wrong about her
hopkick it is prolly cuz it recovers very badly (free juggle) and
because Julia is so small in size, she can't do it u+4 like the Kings
or even heihachi and still be relatively safe. However the uf+4 is
still very powerful since she can do a hopkick (+juggle) off the d,df+
(1)<2 stun and also off a parried low kick (not entirely guranteed
though)

<DayFul>
Julia's basic hopkick is among the best it comes out in 14 frames and
has very high priority. Also this does loads of damage and allows Julia
to hit her infamous wonder juggle on the end taking the damage for
hitting this well over 70 damage. BTW I did not brand it the wonder
juggle some guy was whining about it in TZ and refered to it as the
wonder juggle I just took it from there, pretty much everyone uses that
term now. The only drawback is the poor recovery if it's blocked you
will get hit very hard but you shouldn't intend it to be blocked(Like
many of Julia's moves). Also this is an excellent first hit for class 1
juggles on normal characters, on the big guys b+4 would be better as
you can flip them over for some far more damaging combos this is very
useful though and does more damage. I think the range problem is an
execution flaw the Changs leg reach (Or more specificly Julia's leg
reach) isn't that bad realy, it's just it's done so sloppy but it's
very effective.


Special Techniques
------------------

Command                 Name                          Range   Property

1+2                     Twin Arrow                    m        GB
Chicken command : f+1+3 (for everyone except Anna who is f+2+4) You
                  can't chicken Wang's reversal since it is considered
                  a lp reversal.

<iLuvMomo>
This move is both an excellent and yet not so excellent move. It has
good range and does quite a significant amount of damage yet its
downfall is its slow execution time (21 frames) However it does make up
for it somewhat with a guard stun which gives you a +3 frame advantage.
While nothing is guranteed with that small advantage, it is an
excellent opportunity for Julia to set up her subsequent attacks, like
buffering Mad Axes for example or a simple d+1 to set up her FC/WS
attacks. If it hits, then the effect is quite comical as it sends your
opponent flying away (your opponent can hold DB of course to recover
from the power hit) The Twin Arrow is a good move to use when you are
trying to catch an opponent who is rising from the ground with an
attack due to its good range. You can also use this to of course punish
whiffed/ slow recovering attacks or even people who try to carelessly
tag out (not in).

<DayFul>
Good damage (25) and if it's blocked you have a +3 frame advantage has
dam good reach, it's a bit slow though. this is the closest thing Julia
has to a true power move but (f+1+2 doesn't knockdown so it's not realy
a power move as such even though damage wise). Also it doesn't track
too well either and because it's so slow you can be punished for this.
I'd rather use f+1+2 more damage (Much more on CH), quicker, small
evasion property. But if you connected with this you probobly could
have connected with u/f+4 nuff said.


f+1(~5)                 Flash Uppercut                m        JG
<iLuvMomo>
Another so-so move that Julia has. While performing the flash uppercut,
Julia will duck under her opponents high attacks and dash a little
before performing an uppercut. However, the time that she uses to duck
and dash is quite substantial which leads to this move being used less
at a high level of play. Moreover, this move juggles only normal and
semi big characters and does not juggle fatties (Ganny, Ogre, Jacks
etc) Worse, this move recovers rather poorly when blocked and gives you
a -15 frame disadvantage, enough time for you to be EWGF and df+2'ed.
But this move still is useful because of its evasive properties and is
good against people who get really predictable with their custom
strings (e.g. Mishima scrubs who 1,1 all day) The pay off if this move
hit is good since Julia's combo ability is excellent.

<DayFul>
I personaly like this move a lot it's not very powerful but you can do
a nice long elbow juggle on the end. It's not that fast and if it's
blocked you will be punished but you shouldn't use it expecting it to
be blocked. This doesn't launch too high but Julia can still do plenty
of damage after hitting this. It goes under high attacks so it's very
handy for people who like to jab (1,1,2 Mishima scrubs come to mind,
note I did not see what iLuvMomo wrote about this so it's kinda weird
how we both came up with the same example LOL). And it's a sort of
instant juggle starter (Slow) you can get around 50 damage off this and
it doesn't require CH which is very important for Julia considering her
high dependency on CH. This only launches the fat characters on CH and
you can hit the MC after this on non CH to get in a very nasty 67
damage, who tries to say big guys aren't disadvantaged.


(WR_d,df_d,DF)+1<2    Flash Punch                 m
                      Flash Elbow                 m        FSc
<iLuvMomo>
The flash punch,elbow is a very excellent move for a lot of situations.
First the punch has quite a long reach (for Julia's short hands
anyways) and comes out relatively fast at 11 frames which is how fast a
WGF is. The flash punch has very good priority and is a useful poking
tool in Julia's bulldog approach to the game. On CH the Flash Elbow is
guranteed. Otherwise, the elbow can be blocked. Players like to delay
the flash elbow quite a bit to catch players on CH which lands a big
fat stun. You will have to perform the d,DF version and not d,df if you
wish to delay the flash elbow. For those having trouble doing this
move, all I can say is pick the mishimas and practise their WGF loads
because the d,df motion is the same as the d,df motion in the WGF. If
the stun is not escaped (by pushing f or tagging out) then Julia can
juggle with both uf+4 or df+2,1 whichever she chooses (Note: In Tekken
3 after the flash elbow stun, Julia could do only simple juggles but
not connect with df+2,1 let alone uf+4 so this is a huge improvement
for her) Also, the flash punch is excellent as an okizeme attack on
rolling opponents (refer to Okizeme section) My advice on using d,DF+1<
2 is to mix up the initial flash punch with a delayed Flash elbow or a
throw (preferably Mad axes of course) Also if the flash elbow is
blocked you get -7 frames disadvantage (assuming you do the d,df+1<2
version) which is pretty safe. If your opponent tries something stupid
(like oh say a slow move like Deathfist) then CH him with 1~1,1 or 1~
2,1 and make him pay oh so dearly. Do NOT however try to CH him if he
knows anything about Tekken as he would just poke you out of it
(Mishima's Twin Pistons work great in this situation) Remember to
buffer chicken for the initial punch, though you won't need to buffer
chicken for the elbow.
Well I have gone on so long about how great the flash punch to flash
elbow is I forgot to mention one other thing - it is one of Julia's
best combo enders. Yupz! Try to end any multi elbow combo with d,df+1,2
since it really jacks the damage sky high. Something like the classic
combo of df+2,1, f,f+1 X3, d,df+1,2. Also different in TTT from T3 is
that d,df+1,2 WILL knock away. This was certainly not the case in T3 as
you could do juggles like df+2,1, f,f,f+1,2, f,f+1,4 but this juggle
does not work anymore in TTT.

<DayFul>
This is one of the best moves Julia has, this is a non knockdown, fast,
high prioroty poke that sets up loads of stuff like mad axes maybe a CH
1 attempt, or delay the 2 and stun them on CH. This in a way can be
seen as an answer to Michelle's no knockdown elbow as it can set up a
lot of stuff if only it was as easy to do. This is also a good juggle
ender for Julia's elbow jugles and overall easier than the d,d/f+1,2
variations. This is handy for okizemie if your opponent rolls towards
you or away use this but then the MC does that as well and does more
damage. This is great for closing up distances as you have the running
1, this is what makes Julia such a great pitbull you can run at your
opponents with much less risk than other characters, obviously don't
run for the hell of it you want to be up close but this makes your job
of closing distances much easier. Also this can allow you to throw more
easily as your opponent will need to block a lot of the time you can
use d/f+1+2 and start up her wake up game. This is also a very useful
interupt and the 2 ender is garunteed on CH. If your opponent has a
mid/upper parry you need to use this carefully. On the downside maybe
it's just me or is this move very easy to mess up? And when this misses
you are in a major world of hurt it tracks like shit as well. Also the
2 stun on this allows you to get a full lift on a d/f+2,1 or an u/f+4,
if your opponent doesn't escape stuns use them for absolutely HUGE
damage d,d/f+[1]>2,d/f+2,1,f,f,d+1,d/f+4,3,d/f+4,2,b,>f+1 = 118 damage.
I think you can tell by how much we both wrote that this move rocks and
it should be a major part of your game.


1~1,1(~5)               G-Clef, Club Fist           h,m
                        Flash Uppercut(tag)         m        JG
<iLuvMomo>
This is one of Julia's better move. The first punch (the G-Clef as it
is called) is only 8 frames which is the fastest poke you can get
outside Yoshi's b+1+4 Yoshi Flash Unblockable. If the 1st or 2nd punch
connects on CH, then tthe flash uppercut is guranteed and that can only
mean one thing - Juggle time! However, this move it not without its
risks since the recovery time for both the 2nd and 3rd hit is quite bad
(-15 and -14 respectively) and is long enough for you to be juggled by
a quick EWGF or Twin Pistons. If your know that your opponent is able
to block the last hit, then stop at the second or just go with
1~1,4,3 (Good players will likely see the low hit though and parry it)
Also another thing to note is that, if your opponent ducks the last hit
in anticipation for the bow and arrow, your opponent will not be
juggled unless on CH or he was holding df. Instead he will just grab
his broken nose and fall back (much like Jin's df+2 on normal hit).
Like the standard flash uppercut, this move does NOT juggle fatties,
but should the last hit connect, then you can do a df+4<2<b,f+1, the
Mountain crusher combo which WILL connect as Dayful stated. The command
being all 1's is like Pmartin said, a good panic button combo. However,
if you KNOW you are going to CH your opponent it is better to use 1~2,1
which does more damage though the juggles off 1~2,1 is slightly harder.
Also 1~1,1 can be tag buffered but remember that if the last hit is tag
buffered AND blocked you will have to pay dearly as the Block Adv is -
26... thats long enough for Kazuya's f+1+2 Glorious Demon Fist to
Hit....However, if you are teamed up with someone who can do very
damaging combo's like Bruce or Jin, then the tag buffered 1~1,1 is
worth the risk (assuming you are almost sure that you got your opponent
on CH) and is a better choice than 1~2,1.
Overall, 1~1,1 is a very good move that is devastating in the right
moments but will prove to be Julia's downfall if she starts abusing it.
Remember to buffer chicken for the last hit as it is easily reversed.

<DayFul>
This is your only real useful tag launcher unless you have Jin, Bruce
or Yoshi on your team 1,2,1 is a better choice for damage and you can
tag out off that anyway afer the juggle. Ok this starts with an 8 frame
jab so you can get a CH fairly often but it has very bad recovery when
blocked and as iLuvMomo said -26 when blocked that is absolutely
hideous Nina can even get her DC in (One of the few times it can
actualy conect now ;p). However this is an excellent move to use off
the sidestep as you can cofortably take off 50% of a lifebar from your
opponent and if you have netsu it's around 90 damage. Overall 4,4,1 is
probobly better off the side damage wise but this is faster, also I'm
not sure of the risk in Ling's backturned low parry if it can be used
at the side so this is safer anyway. For all of this to connect you
need to be around 26% of the way round your opponent (Julia's SS is 18%
if Armour Xahn gave the correct info). Your opponent can otherwise
block the second hit with f so be wary of that. You will probobly be
able to hit this after sidestepping moves like Paul's deathfist and
Jin's f,f+2.
Yea I said in TZ a while back that the MC can connect after it the
timing is funny from what I've seen you need to buffer d/f+4 after the
third hit connects, the timing is similar to CH d,d/f+[1],2,d/f+2,1 so
if you have that down this will be easy sick damage. Anyway if you have
netsu and are up against a fat character this is deadly and you should
use it in preference to 1~2~1. I'm not too sure if this applies to f+1
but I do find it connecting after that as well same timing as above.
Also this is EXTREMELY easy to chicken you can simply use 1~F+1+3,1+3,1
+3, yes it reads the comand 1~1,1 but you can just use 1 then the
buffer the chicken and the rest of the commands can be in puted as 1+3
you need to hold F and you have a very easy chicken buffer that works
with any move that has the same chicken command for the same limb
(Bob's 3,3,3,3 LOL scrubby but one hell of a good bait for reversal
scrubs). So if your up against reversal scrubs use that as you main
chicken bait.


1~1,4,3                 G-Clef, Club Fist             h,m
                        Bow and Arrow                 l,m
<iLuvMomo>
Another variant after her G-clef, Club fist. Like 1~1,1 if the first or
second hit on CH, the rest are guranteed. You won't prolly use this
move much at a higher level of play since good players will easily be
able to see the low sweep coming and parry/ block it. However, 1~1,4,3
and 1~1,1 mix up is pretty good at intermediate level since your
average player will not have those oh so quick reflexes to guess where
to block. Generally if the 4 connects, then 3 is guranteed. There are
some exceptions like against Ling or Ganny. For Ling, even if the 4
connects the follow up 3 will wiff because she is too short. As for
Ganny, no matter how I tried, I just couldn't get the 4 to connect so
the 3 will whiffed or at most get blocked. Also if you are not sure
whether the 4 will connect or get blocked, it is best to do just 1~1,4
(although good players will I'm sure barry it). Besides you will end up
in FC position and have full excess to Julia's mixups.

<DayFul>
If 1 is blocked or non CH you can occasionaly throw the 1~1,4 out, it's
not fast enough to hit consistently though. It will rip scrubs to
shreads but good players will kill you for this, a fellow Julia player
could use the d/f low parry and get a garunteed d/f+2,1 hope I inspired
some caution there. This should be used very sparingly if the 4
connects the 3 is garunteed (Unless your up against Ling, or
Roger/Alex, the 4 won't connect on Ganny) don't use it often or you
will get killed for it.

<iLuvMomo>
This move is exactly like 1~1,1 without the initial jab. If the Club
fist lands on CH then the flash uppercut is again guranteed. The
problem is that the Club Fist isn't entirely the fastest move in the
game at 20 frames... thats plenty of time for your opponent to block/
deathfist/ wgf you. It would seem that such a move be seemingly
useles.. but it actually has one use. As pointed out by MIC in jjt and
koftekkens Advanced Guide (an excellent FAQ which I suggest everyone
should read) If you know that your opponent is going to techroll to
their left you can try this... uf+4, 1, f,f+1, f,f+1, (df+1),1 to catch
those techrolling fools and relaunch them. From there just finish the
juggle unless of course your opponent is super dumb in which case you
can just rinse and repeat. Also I find that df+1,1 is excellent to
punish people who do d+1 too much. If you are expecting your opponent
to d+1 you, then hit df+1,1 to CH him with the Club fist and launch
him.

<DayFul>
Very slow but it's a good chicken baiter if you aren't good at
buffering chickens very easy to buffer the chickens but they may prefer
to CH you, Bruce's 3 will beat out this crap and I'm sure you know what
that leads to. Apart from the tech roll punishing ability this has as
iLuvMomo has already stated I don't use this much at all it's just so
slow not to mention the horible lag when blocked.

<iLuvMomo>
Utterly useless if you ask me unless of course you are playing a scrub
and want to mix up between the flash uppercut and the Bow and arrow, in
which case 1~1,4,3 and 1~1,1 would serve the purpose better. All in
all, this is a move Julia should avoid using.

<DayFul>
I never really bothered with this version the startup is very slow and
the pay off isn't very good leave it alone there's no point using it
the 1~1,4,3 is better if you feel the need to mix the moves up.



1~2,1(~5)                 G-Clef, Gut Punch             h,m
                          Skyscraper Cannon(tag)        m        CH
<iLuvMomo>
If in a situation you are given a choice to use 1~2,1 and 1~1,1, almost
always choose to use this instead of her 1~1,1. Why? Because of the
damage... well not by much (5 pts) but hey... I won't give up extra
damage if I were you. There are a few problems though. First off, the
juggle off 1~2,1 is a lil bit harder (well to scrubs anyways) since the
skyscraper Cannon knocks them quite far away so you will have to dash
quite a bit to continue juggling them. Secondly, 1~2,1 isn't really tag
combo friendly since only a tag slide or dive (fatties) is guranteed.
So again if you are teamed up with someone like Jin, then 1~1,1 will be
a better choice. Also, the first punch HAS to hit on a CH for the
skyscraper cannon to be performed. There is no use if the gut punch
connects on CH. Therefore, again in some situations, 1~1,1 will be
better. The best example is this.. a bryan scrubs comes at you from
range 2 with his 1,2,1,2 punches, where the first punch wiffs but the
rest are bound to connect (or get blocked at least) In this situation,
it would be safer to back up a bit and hit 1~1,1. Even if the first
punch doesn't connect, the club fist will hit on CH and thus gurantee
you a juggle. It would be far better than risking to stand your ground
with 1~2,1 as you might get hit in return on CH. To view this example
in action, watch "shafi vs nappi 4" of the world tourneys. One thing to
bear in mind when using 1~2 is that even though it may not seem so, the
recovery of the gut punch (2) is as bad as that of 1~1 therefore, do
not be a moron and go around telling people to use 1~2,1 instead of
1~1,1 because of the better recovery kay?
One small tip, which works well up to intermediate level at least is
that if you have problems breaking throws, and your opponent has the
habit of running up to you with either a throw or a power move, you
could just fiddle between 1 and 2. If you are lucky (well according to
statisctics it would be 33 1/3%) then you will break his throw, and if
he tries a power move, then you will get a CH 1~2,1.

<DayFul>
This is so so deadly, loads of damage on its own and a 40+ damage
juggle. This actualy does much more damage than 1~1,1 the strongest CH
1~1,1 combo comes up to 82 damage (Yes I do have a better one than
f,f,N+1(x3)d,d,d/f+1,2), 1~2,1 and the strongest juggle off that brings
the dmage up to 93 damage so it's considerably more. Also this launches
the big guys just as high as everyone else so this is a much better
option in that situation. This is best used of the sidestep as you are
facing your opponet and they are not facing you so even if they have an
8 frame jab like you it won't matter as they will be jabbing thin air.
The only problem is on non CH the 1~2 has bad recovery time but if your
opponent tries to punish the lag the 4 ender could be used for CH
unless Ling uses d/f+1 to get in to RD which would be a pain in the
ass. Your opponent should realy try to duck to avoid the followups so
it isn't as punishable as it may seem. And yes the recovery of 1~2 is
very bad it's not as punishable as you may think as she can stick the 4
ender in and if you opponent tries anything you can CH them (Not sure
about an 8 frame jab or d+1). Obviously most people will crouch to
avoid the sad excuse for a mixup but hey they have to crouch so they
can't realy punish you.
I've already said how the changes to d,d/f+1,2 has made the 1,2,1
juggles more difficult as you can't hit f,f+1,4 after this. As I said
before if it had stayed how it was this would probobly be a 100+ damage
combo for Julia has she would have been able to hit many more elbows
after d,d/f+1,2 shame that. One other bad thing now in TTT or at least
on the PS2 the clean hit damage of the gut punch has been toned down.
The long legged characters such as King and Eddy took around 55 damage
off 1~2,1 making it a good bit stronger but it's now 51 for all
characters, of course on the other hand it does more damage to
characters like Ling so that's good seen as her stamina sucks. Unless
you feel the need to tag juggle this is overall a better choice than 1~
1,1 if you know it is a CH.


1~2,3                   G-Clef, Gut Punch             h,m
                        Low Kick                      l        RC
<iLuvMomo>
One of Julia's more pathetic moves. The low kick is soooooo slow it
just BEGS to be parried/ blocked. Worse still the recovery of the low
kick when blocked... it just begs to be WS'ed. Even when it connects,
you are STILL at a disadvantage. Use only against scrubs since they
never learn to block low and then harass them with Julia's FC mixups.
If the low kick is blocked (not parried) try rising with a Skyscraper
kick since it will override most things. Never EVER use this against
good players unless you miss seeing Jin's WS+2, b,f+2,1,2 combo a lot.

<DayFul>
Do you want a low parry on your ass not thought not because I guarantee
you if you use this that is what will happen (d/f+2,1 again). The kick
is very very easy to block and well your opponent will always crouch.
The only good thing about this is your opponent has to defend this,
they can't punish the lag of 1~2 because of the existence of this move
that's the only good thing about it.


1~2,4                     G-Clef, Gut Punch             h,m
                          High Kick                     h
<iLuvMomo>
Use this only once in a while. Although the last hit, a high kick may
seemingly be useless, it can be used to catch players who are too eager
to counter you. Most players will duck (or at least have their
controller pointing towards df) and you will wiff the kick (wiffs
aren't good you know....) However, if you always do 1~2 ONLY, your
opponent may think that you have mucked up with your 1~2 and then try
to attack you. The high kick will CH them and give you a nice
opportunity for a yummy elbow juggle. Use this in moderation, maybe
once in 10 matches and prolly it will bear fruit.

<DayFul>
Against good players this is just as bad as the above option but some
over eager opponents may try to punish the huge lag of a blocked 1~2
you could try the 4 on CH you will float them for your CH 4 juggles
(This isn't quite as fast as the basic 4 though or it doesn't seem to
be). Don't use it often but if your opponent does anything dumb on a
non CH 1~2 don't hesitate to use the 4 ender as the payoff is very
good. so like 1~2,3 it sucks realy but it's existence wipes out the
potential punishment of a blocked 1~2.

                        Skyscraper Kick               m        JG
<iLuvMomo>
I reckon that this has to be Julia's most improved move from T3. I
remember the days in T3 when I groaned over how I couldn't even perform
a 3 elbow juggle with ease. Now in TTT, her party crasher (aka Elbow)
is now much better than that in T3 because of the better recovery time
after each elbow (which also means more elbows in a juggle) even though
it still does not recover as fast as that of Michelles. Before I go
into much detail with the Elbow, Skyscraper Kick, let me enlighten
those who do not know about the properties. First there are two ways to
do it... f,f,N+1 and f,F+1. For the first method (f,f,N+1) the elbow
recovers much faster, but you have to do the skyscraper kick
immediately if you want it to come out. The second method has slower
recovery but you can also delay skyscraper kick, which is vital in
ending some multi elbow juggles.
Well enough talk about the party crasher Sky scraper kick. What is it
used for? Duh! Her strings. Her Party crasher is prolly useless if it
hits your opponent since it will hit your opponent too far away unlike
Michelle where on CH the skyscraper kick and a combo is guranteed. But
in some sense the KND can be quite useful, like a Safe tag for example
or Okizeme (more on this in the Okizeme section) Anyways with Julia,
you will want the party crasher blocked (yes you read right) to start
one of Julia's guessing games. Say your opponent blocks the party
crasher he would then have to guess whether you would follow up with
the sky scraper kick, buffer mad axes, hand him another party crasher
or try to CH his power move with 1~1,1 or 1~2,1. Another plus is that
if her sky scraper kick connects, then Julia can continue with her f,f+
1 x3, d,df+1,2 juggle much like Michelle can juggle after f,f+1,4. Put
it this way, the party crasher is one of Julia's various setup tools
for her mix up game (along with d,df+1, fake low parry etc) In one very
good example, the party crasher is used to set up her throws. Not only
is it a useful move to set up Mad Asses. I mean Axes, but the party
crasher also has special properties to duck immediately by holding down
after inputting the party crasher (thus f,f,N+1~D). This is especially
useful if you want to set up her FC,db,d,DB+1+2 throw. To see this
trick in action do download "Shafi vs Nappi 4" from the world tourneys.
Also the Party crasher has always been a famous Chang move in combos
especially those multi elbow ones. It is bound to irritate your
opponent since they keep bouncing in the air for a long looooong time
and each time the elbow hits, it does only miniscule damage (amounting
to roughly a jab) However, the usefulness of the elbows has been toned
down somewhat now in TTT with the addition of her Mountain crusher
since it is a better juggle ender after uf+4, d+1, FC+4,3. (f,f+1,4
ending was very risky in T3 since if you missed and your opponent tech
rolled he would rise behind you for a free back throw... not very good)
Still the improvement in the recovery of her elbows makes her multi
elbow juggles a whole lot more better than what they used to be.
Lastly, the Party crasher is good to catch rolling opponents. If you
manage to hit a party crasher on a rolling opponent, you will cause
them to float in the air and thus you can do the f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,
d,df+1,2 combo.

<DayFul>
This is the ultimate in piss hit in TTT and the improvements to Julia's
elbow are one of the things that have made her much better. In T3 this
wasn't too good as it had fairly bad lag when blocked even the quick
recovering elbow (I still used it loads which just emphasised how great
this move is). Now it's a case of if in doubt an elbow is a pretty safe
bet. Sadly this knocks your opponent away unlike Michelle who can do a
hell of a lot of nasty/cheap stuff with this but still it's fast and
interups very well. One nice advantage Julia's elbow has is that the 4
ender will always connect on fat characters so consider this a 22
damage move on fat characters much better. It's easy on True Ogre but I
find you need a very small dealy on other fat characters unless it's
the way you input the move. And one small point Julia's elbow has
exactly the same frame data as Michelle's she just loses a frame in the
N input it's a sad idea I don't know who started is it too difficult to
look up frame data? One good thing is Julia has the delayable f,f+1>4
so people may try to punish the huge lag on the delayable elbow it will
avoid high attacks and throws and simply out priorotise a lot of moves.
It's also very useful for tagging out safely which is always a good
thing you can safely knock your opponent away and this is easy to
connect with. It can keep away people who want to try and poke you to
death (Anna, Bruce, Ling, ect). But anyway this is more useful when
blocked as you can keep a constant offense try to get a CH you could
grab them with mad axes don't go overboard as you can be interupted
with d+1 but it's very useful for keeping up the pressure on your
opponent. And then for jugling it can make for some long, iritating and
tag partner health replenishing juggles so if your partner has taken a
beating 6 elbows will be very useful if you want to kill some time. Use
this a lot you can bank on hitting a few of these every round and the
damage does add up.

Chicken command : f+2+4 for everyone.
<iLuvMomo>
*erm*....<tries to think of the good points of this move> Well... it
stuns and it does quite a lot.... and well ARGHHH! This move sucks. Its
almost worthless. It takes almost eons for this move to come out, even
eddy mashers will CH you out of it before you can even hit with this
move. Who the hell will ever fall for the flash uppercut fake in the
first place? DOH! Well you could use it for catching back rolling
opponents (whats f,f+1 for anyways) or you could use it to catch
tagging in/ out opponents (then why do you have uf+4 and df+2,1) or you
could just use this move in juggles after you have grown sick of her
elbow and wonder juggle. Use this move only in extreme moderation.

<DayFul>
Decent far away okizeme tool and if they try to catch you with a rising
mid kick or sweep you will stun them, the stun is very easy to escape
though. One very good scenario is if you stun your opponent in the back
(Tag out and okizemie) then they can't do much other than take the stun
combo if they try to tag out you have WR,1,2. Other than that don't use
this much. But seriously the only time I use this is to punish scrubs
tagging out (Let them tag but the ridiculous range this has will allow
you to hit them), altenately to that after the right side throw and you
may get lucky and stun if they see this coming and seen as it's slow
they may try a rising mid kick or sweep and you can stun them in the
back and they can either take the juggle or escape and invite an OB
trap. Other than that it's realy crap.

                  though since this is considered a lp reversal.
<iLuvMomo>
I like this move a lot. Although it might be slow to initiate it has
good range and more importantly leaves you relatively safe when
blocked. Even with a -3 frame disadvantage, f+1+2 pushes your opponent
so far away that you are completely safe. Your opponent has NO
advantage whatsoever. (Btw, I'm referring to f+1+2 sans tag buffering -
but why on earth you would want to tag buffer f+1+2 in the first place
I don't know) On CH this move will launch so you can jump kick your
opponent before continuing with her elbows. Anyways enough talk about
this move. So when should you use this move? Do not, I repeat do NOT
just throw this out in the open with your opponent a distance away from
you and hope for the mistake. People who use this move that way often
deem this move useless. You are just ASKING for the move to wiff and
eat a EWGF in return. Instead, use this move when you sidestep your
opponent and find that there is some distance between you and your
opponent try using this move. If he tries any stupid move you will get
him on CH and as everyone knows Julia's side juggles are something to
be feared (especially on fatties) You have a very good chance at CH
since f+1+2 ducks under a lot of high attacks and has extremely good
reach. If he doesn't so what? You still have dealt him a decent amount
of damage right?

<DayFul>
Very good damage Julia crouches slightly in the opening frames the
evasion shouldn't be relied upon, but I do find this avoiding the
standing 4 for example so it's fairly useful in that respect you can
call it pretty certain that it avoids jabs but it's too slow to CH a
jab. If it CH's you get a class one juggle with the damage rivaling
that of 1,2,1 On CH this can lead to over 80 damage. This should be
your power move of choice it's underrated, not abuseable though 19
frames is not fast. This is also good to use of the sidestep it is much
better than SS+2 and always launches at the side for an easy b+4,f,f,N+
1,d/f+4,2,b<f+1 which make for excellent damage. Even better on fat
characters you can use b+4,f,f,N+1(x9) or 7 knees with Bruce sick. The
great thing is you only have a -3 frame advantage when blocked and you
push your opponent back anyway, so for a move with such excellent
damage potential being safe when blocked makes this a very useul move
even if it doesn't qualify as a good power shot (According to Rev
because of the lack of a knockdown).


1+4,3                   Club Fist-Bow & Arrow         m,l,m
<iLuvMomo>
The clubfist- bow and arrow is like 1~1,4,3 minus the initial punch.
IMO it isn't really good because the club fist is slow to initiate and
moreover the bow and arrow is easily seen coming by good players.
Against scrubs or intermediate players though it may prove to be more
useful though I still suggest that you stay with 1~1,4,3 if you want
some mixups.

<DayFul>
Well this is basicly the same as d/f+1,4,3 which as we have already
said it's crap so don't use this either.

                        Skyscrapper Cannon(tag)       m        JG
<iLuvMomo>
Although the Gut Punch is rather slow to initiate and has kinda poor
reach compared to other Julia moves, the Gut Punch skyscrapper Cannon
is one of Julia's most underestimated move and one which is extremely
useful. Unlike 1~2,1 the skyscrapper Cannon will come out as long as
the Gut Punch hits your opponent in the front on any hit - CH or Clean
hit. The Gut Punch is an excellent move to use when you rush up to your
opponent and know that he is going to duck (or if he gets up and
crouches) since the risk is not as great as that of a hopkick (though
the pay off is of course less) It is a very safe move to use as long as
you don't wiff with it since it has excellent recovery (-6 frames for a
blocked gut punch) compared to its 1,2 cousin. What is best though is
that the Gut Punch is guranteed off certain situations like a parried
low right kick. oooooOoooh! Can You just SMELL the damage? Also in
certain situations, the gut punch is guranteed but not the hopkick like
after blocking one of Laws flip kick where he recovers low (eg. 3,4) .
In this situation you have just enough time to punish him with df+2,1
but a Hopkick will be blocked. Also after a FC,df+2 elbow stun ONLY df+
2,1 is guranteed (this is not the case for d,df+(1),2 stun where both a
hopkick and df+2,1 are guranteed) Remember also that df+2,1 is such a
good move to catch tagging in opponents. I kinda stray away from uf+4
hopkick because it is far more risky. In conclusion, although df+2,1
may seem like a dumb move in the first place due to the poor range and
slow initiation, used at the right place at the right time WILL win you
matches. Go Ahead. Try it.

<DayFul>
This is your safe tag in punisher and does loads of damage and it is
actualy more damaging than an u/f+4 and it's safe when blocked at only
-6 frame disadvantage. It's a bit slow (16 frames) but you can dash in
and use this with pretty good success. You just need to see how often
Shafi connects with this against Shauno in semi final of the tourney
vids that are at electric cancel if you doubt it's usefulness. If your
opponent whiffs anything hit them with this if it was slow enough. Also
this is a pretty useful okizemie tool, if your opponent recovers
crouching whack them with this and put them back on the floor with half
of there life bar gone. Of course that is when you mixup with d/f+1+2
which is the easiest throw to get in when running. This is garunteed of
a parried low kick when you use the d/f low parry which is just unfair.
Whatever you do never whiff with this the lag is frightening and you
can be hit by pretty much anything. This can now be used off her d,d/f+
(1),2 and FC,d/f+2 stun it's escapable and considering the lag this has
the risk of missing is a bit much IMO. If your opponent doesn't escape
the stun they will learn very quickly.


df+2,3                   Gut Punch                     m
                         Low Kick                      l        RC
<iLuvMomo>
Goodness me! This move really stinks. Already hampered by the slow
execution and lack of distance of the Gut punch, at least the low kick
executes faster than it would with 1,2,3. That doesn't save anything
from it though. You may be able to catch scrubs with this OCCASIONALLY.
But if you land the low kick on a good opponent, remember to jot down
that day and buy yourself a lottery. Use this move only if you are
trying to tell your opponent that YOU SUCK. Otherwise stay clear of
this move like the plague.

<DayFul>
Look familiar? Do not use this, actually it's much worse because of the
slow start up. Well iLuvMomo gave the d/f+2,4 the vote for Julia's
worst move this sucks a bit more for me as another Chang player hitting
d/f+2,1 on you is a bit more servere than u/f+4 wonder juggle, also the
3 does a crappy 10 damage considering the huge risk this is worse. O
wait no there is worse two of them actualy but yea this move is one of
the worst.


df+2,4                  Gut Punch                     m
                        High Kick                     h
<iLuvMomo>
This is Julia's WORST move IMO. If you ever connect with both hits of
df+2,4 remember to buy yourself a lottery ticket. To be honest, winning
a lottery is easier than connecting with both hits on a button mashing
scrub. First df+2, is so slow and unless on CH the High kick will wiff.
Second, your opponent will already have ducked in anticipation of your
low kick and thus the high kick will wiff... can you say WS+2? I feel
it is MUCH safer should df+2 be blocked not to follow up with 4 since
df+2 blocked is as I mentioned -6 frames and you won't run the risk of
eating a WS move after wiffing the high kick. 3rd, since the high kick
comes out slightly faster than it would for 1,2,4, the chances of
scoring a CH is slimmer than me winning the World Championships (I'm
exagerrating of course). Prolly one of the worst move in Julia's
arsenal.

<DayFul>
Not as good as the other variation you aren't as vulnerable when d/f+2
is blocked but the slow startup leaves this not worth doing. Is your
opponent going to try and punish a 6 frame lag and give you a free CH
no this isn't as crap as d/f+2,3 but never use it. I find it amusing
that this was seen as a part of a custom string game for Julia you
wonder why so many people thought she sucked in T3 very few people know
how to play T3 Julia properly.


(d+2~N+3_2+3),1(~5)     Ultimate Cannon(tag)          sM,m,m   JG
<iLuvMomo>
Okay So I lied when I said df+2,4 was Julia's worst move. But the
Ultimate Cannon is really the ultimate crap move of all time. It is
practically d+2 low jab to a rising Kick before Julia charges up for
the flash uppercut. d+2~N+3 alone is OKAY and can be used in juggles or
to create some space when they are in FC position. It also can be used
for Mad Axes setup. Problem is the delay between the rising Kick and
the flash uppercut is so great that it is a tragedy waiting to happen.
Kazuya can get a df+2 in (thats 40 big points of damage on CH + clean
hit) Wang can get db+4,2 in, heck even Julia herself can get f+1+2.
And if Juggles aren't your cup of tea, then May I suggest sidestepping
twice around the last hit so you can get nice back throw.. *oucH* Kings
Octopus slam just gotta hurt. Even a simple throw WILL throw Julia out
of the flash uppercut animation. Use d+2~N+3 but Never .... and I mean
NEVER try the 1 follow up. It really is so sad that for a character
with such an extensive movelist Julia is filled with piles of turd.
Really makes Kazuya proud in comparison... short movelist, effective
use.

<DayFul>
Never use the 1 ender as you will eat a backthrow, or maybe I'll stick
3xSS, 4,4,1 and juggle you at the side and smack off over half of your
life or maybe Devil's SS+2 or a clean hit CH deathfist or Kazuya's
clean hit CH d/f+2 or, well you get the idea this is so so so so so
incredibly crap. I remember in T2 the ender did a nasty 45 damage and
there was no tech roll and the huge amount of time it took to stand up,
Michelle had some evil juggle+okizemie but now it's totally shit. So
what the 1 ender avoids high attacks, yes as I found out much to my
amusement whiff 2+3 Bryan scrub thinks f,f+2 and bam CH 1 ender and
wonder juggle on the end, if they want to be scrubby I can be scrubbier
LOL. Sadly the 2+3 version now hits Sm, in T3 it was realy useful for
tick damage but now this move sucks ass competely leave it alone. This
is probobly her worst move overall as it's the most risky and has
absolutely no good use at all, Ironic name for a move realy.


(WR_FC,df)+2            Flash Elbow                   m        FSc
<iLuvMomo>
The Flash elbow is a bit of a risky move which pays off handsomely
enough. You will prolly use the FC, df+2 version more often rather than
the WR version. Anyways with Julia's excellent FC mixup (WS+2 links,
FC,df+4,3, WS+4 and of course FC,df+2) the flash elbow is a good move
to use. Moreover, the Flash elbow, once initiated has great priority
and will interrupt almost any move. However it really suffers with its
recovery which at -20 frames is just a free WGF juggle for your
opponent. If you really want to use this move (I prefer the less risk
WS+4) then at least you must hope for this move to hit. To do this, you
should try training your opponent to block low (FC,df+4) and then
occasionally, just OCCASIONALLY try the flash elbow. As RevC pointed
out in his Michelle FAQ, you could try this move at the edge of the
Flash Elbow range (therefore knowing your range is critical) but that
could be risky especially if your opponent plays a turtling game and
backdashes a lot. You should also attempt the running version of the
flash elbow when closing the distance on your opponent and you know he
likes to get up with a rising attack or try a power move (deathfist for
example). On CH, your opponent is stunned. The stun is of course
escapable but getting the opportunity to stun your opponent is really
rare indeed. Maybe try this move after you block a low move and your
opponent trys a high move (eg. Hwoarang's 1,1,3,3) Unlike the stun off
d,df+(1),2 you can only juggle using df+2,1 and not the hopkick. I
still remember that in Tekken 3 the Flash Elbow was used as a combo
ender in Combos such as uf+4, FC,df+4,3, d+1, FC,df+2 but that combo is
rarely used due to its difficulty and risk involved, even more so today
with the introduction of the great Mountain Crusher.

<DayFul>
First the FC version is very important to the fake low parry mixup this
is why you will be able to use FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 fairly often as this
does some pretty good damage to discourage crouching. Also this gives a
stun on CH which you can launch with d/f+2,1 (Not u/f+4) it's escapable
but the damage is good. I feel with Julia's FC mixups you opponent
would be more inclined to block and keep ther distance though. The
other version is another great addition to Julia's running game if your
opponent thinks you running at them = a deathfist smack them with this,
it has excelent priority and good reach, the recovery is bad (20 frames
which is realy bad) but then you could use the running 1 that has -2
recovery with recovery which is safe. This can be used in juggles but
unless you are going for style it's not realy worth it.


SS+2                    Parting Fist                  m        GS
<iLuvMomo>
This is Julia's brand Spankin' New SS move and one which I feel isn't
really that good when compared to Michelles arsenal of Sidestep moves.
When doing this, Julia takes a small step forward and lunges out with
her right fist. There is no guranteed stuff if this hit (Like
Michelle's SS+2), no guranteed knockdown (like Michelle's SS+1), does
not Juggle (like Michelle's SS+3,4) and poor recovery if it whiffs.
This itself has deterred me from using the Parting Fist in serious
combat. I usually pull the Parting fist off by mistake while trying to
do the Mad Axes after sidestep. Speaking of Mad axes, you can buffer
Mad axes after SS+2 much like you can with almost every move. Besides
after a sidestep it would be best to try for 1~1,1 or 4,4,1 (if you are
really sure you can are behind your ops) Sure some may argue that the
parting fist has good range (Well for Julia yes but for someone like
PJack No) but if you WANT range then go for SS f+1+2. And whats with
the +1 hit advantage? Sure you can set up things but after SS 1~1,1 you
get some nice fat damage. Which would you want? Use this move only
moderately.

<DayFul>
What the hell Michelle gets so many excellent SS moves and Julia gets
this, what where Namco thinking? It's ok if you haven't SS a good
distance but Julia has much much stronger options than this you won't
need this much. It's safe when blocked and gives a nice frame advantage
on normal hit and CH so mad axes can be easily buffered yet again. I
have came to the conclusion that this move sucks pretty badly as it
sure as hell seems way too slow the damage is ok but it doesn't seem to
track well either f+1+2 is MUCH better. Actualy of all the options
Julia has of the sidestep there are many better non SS mover better
than this.


(b+2_2~b)               Arm Whip                      h        OB
<iLuvMomo>
The Arm whip of Julia is an average move IMO because of the fact that
the standing 2 is rather slow (compared to her 1 at least) After the
arm whip you are at a frame disadvantage (-1 frame) You can try for a
back throw but chances are your opponent will duck it. You can of
course try to hit him with a mid hitting move (hopkick) but if your
opponent attacks (standing 3_4) then he will hit you first. You can
also allow your opponent to attack first and duck/block it but that
would be extra risky since some characters like Ling have both low and
mid hitting attacks from BK position. Otherwise you can try *evil* d+1
which should hit him and since he is already backturned give you the
opportunity to try all those fancy stuff like WS+2,1,1.

<DayFul>
You are at a frame disadvantage after this and no one is going to stand
there and take a back throw you could try a d+1 to set up an OB trap
but your opponent could beat you to the d+1 (iLuvMomo's note: BT d+1 is
6 frames only which beats out anything you throw). Even worse a Ling
player will actualy gain the initiative as being in RD is always a good
thing for her and you give away the frame advantage, not a good move at
all not even against scrubs. The only potential plus is if you have
Michelle on your team and your opponent crouches to avoid the tag
throw, well use d+1 just make them guess so if you don't have have
Michelle on your team this sucks but if you do this may actualy be
pretty dam good.

"?" I give up. If you can think of a good way to use this move do tell
me. This move is easily ducked, by even morons although the CPU falls
for this 99% of the time and even if it does connect does nothing other
than erm.. push your opponent a bit away? Wholesome crapness all round.

This is so crap it can be ducked and it doesn't give you any initiative
you simply push your opponent away no reward at all I never use it even

                          Flash Elbow                   m        FSc
<iLuvMomo>
Of Julia's many WS+2 moves, I feel that this is prolly the weakest one
of them all. Undoubtedly, the flash elbow can be delayed for very long
periods to try to induce a stun. However unlike its fellow counterpart,
d,df+1,2 the recovery of the flash elbow is HORRIBLE. With -20 should
the flash elbow be blocked (I'm not even going to bother talking about
if it should wiff) your opponent could murder you with half his arsenal
of moves of WGF's, Deathfists, hopkicks and so on. The only situation
where this move might be of some use would prolly be during OB trap
when you are already in FC position. It would be much safer to try WS+
2,2 instead of WS+2,1,4,3 (though you could try WS+2,1,1) Stay clear
from yet another stinker.

<DayFul>
Definitely the worst of the tequila sunrise combos' not very good
damage, horrible lag when blocked this should be left alone. BTW the 2
ender does not stun on the PS2 so it's even worse there but you don't
need this it sucks. As for OB traps this is probobly the best tequlia
sunrise combo for the job why? well it knocks down and both hits will
connect unlike the other variations which will either whiff or can be
escaped.

                          C.Fist-Flash Uppercut(tag)    m,m      SH
<iLuvMomo>
This is another mediocre move that Julia has. You will prolly never
ever use her 3~2,1,1 version of the tequilla sunrise into cfist and
flash uppercut since there is the better and faster 1~1,1. What kills
this move though is the fact that the flash uppercut does NOT launch.
What will happen is your opponent merely grabs his nose in pain,
stumbles back abit and then falls down. If you tag out after the flash
uppercut, then you can get a guranteed tag slide (or cross chops for
fatties) This might seem good but when you compare that to a CH 1~1,1
which launches your opponent for some meaty juggles, 3~2,1,1 really is
crap. Oh yeah and the flash uppercut is not guranteed unless the 3~2 or
WS+2 hits on CH which mean it is not as good as 1~1,1. Oh yeah. WS+
2,1,1 has one very good use. OB trap. The reason this is excellent is
because WS+2,1,1 does a good deal of damage (43 points if I'm not
mistaken) on normal characters. Best though is that your opponent will
sometimes grab his nose and stumble backwards towards you like Jin's
df+2 in T3 (don't ask me why this happens after hitting your opponent's
back) and if they are dumb you can repeat the whole process again.

<DayFul>
If this CH's it's all guaranteed and you get a free tag slide but if
you CH ALWAYS use WS+2,4,1 as you can juggle off it. There's one little
problem you won't CH this very often it comes out in 18 frames and has
a very obvious startup. The recovery sucks if this is blocked on a non
CH you are going to eat something like a WGF never a good thing. This
is okayish in OB traps after a d+1 but yes it can be tagged out of
after the second hit which is crap it will total about 30 damage. So
this sucks in OB traps as well overall this has been toned down badly
from T3 this rocked in OB traps as it was all garunteed once WS+2 hit
and it juggled.

                        Club Fist-Bow & Arrow         m,l,m
<iLuvMomo>
Unless you really want to play mix up games with Julia, then this move
isn't of all that much use. On CH, all 4 hits are guranteed which means
they will produce some meaty damage. However if you are going to try
the bow and arrow mix up against good players, you are just asking to
be parried and punished. The 3~2,1,4,3 is much much more obvious than 1
~1,4,3 because Julia moves forward quite a bit. Like 1~1,4,3 the last
kick will wiff ling while the low kick will not hit Ganny. And WS+
2,1,4,3 isn't all that useful in OB traps since the last kick will most
likely wiff. Anyways like 1~1,4,3 if you stop at the low kick you will
recover crouching to start her WS games.
Oh yeah, and for those who have trouble beating the comp on ultra hard
mode, well just use this move alone. The comp is too stupid to block
the bow and arrow kick. So you can just cruise through all your
oponents using just this one move alone. Of course it doesn't work on
Ganny and Ling so if you have to fight them then you gotta use some
skillz.

<DayFul>
Another scrub killer a handy mixup with WS+2,1,1 but good players will
parry the 4. If you CH this does good damage but you have better
options. And yes the 3 misses Ling and Roger and the 4 misses Ganny so
that sucks also it sucks for OB traps it just sucks.

<iLuvMomo>
Uh! If the razor sweep hits then the high sweep is guranteed. But in
that case just use WS+2_3~2, 4,1 instead since the uppercut is
guranteed and will juggle. The high kick is practically worthless since
the recovery is abysmal if blocked. (-19 thats a free EWGF) Even if it
DOES connect you are at a frame disadvantage. And its worthless in OB
trap since the High kick will wiff. Dumb move. Use this not.

<DayFul>
Decent damage but There are stronger options and if the last 4 gets
avoided you are in big trouble but you probably won't get that far
another crappy tequila sunrise combo, wait they all suck. O and I'm
pretty sure the ender is not garunteed after the sweep conects that
applies to Michelle only (Still it sucks who is going to get hit by the
4).

<iLuvMomo>
Another useless move. Maybe not as bad as WS+2,4,4 since scrubs will
never ever block the low kick. But even if they do eat the low kick,
you are at a horrible frame disadvantage (- 8 frames!!) The recovery of
the low kick is horrible when blocked though it does leave you in FC
position. Problem is with such a horrible frame disadvantage, you can't
really do much even in FC position. You can prolly get away with using
this once or twice against Scrubs but never try this move against
advanced players. They will definitely make you pay.

<DayFul>
Well you have the scrubby low mid mixup with the 1 so scrub
intermediate players do eat this fairly often but it's not very good at
all. throw it out once in a while (Against scrubby players no one else
will eat two consecutive slow low kicks). but it will get parried often
if you use this more than once every few rounds. The risk of this move
is too high for the poor reward.

This move is extremely effective against scrubs. In fact, by using this
move alone you can kill most scrubs much like by doing Kazuya's uf+
4,4,4,4. If the razor sweep hits, you are guranteed the Razor's edge
uppercut which means free juggle. Problem though is that good players
will ultimately always parry the low kick which leaves you in trouble.
The Razor Sweep is extremely slow and extremely telegraphed. Also
contrary to my initial believe, WS+2,4,1 is not useful during OB trap
since the razor's edge WILL definitely wiff (not sure though about
fatties but I will try that out some day)

<DayFul>
This is will do loads of damage on CH (Juggle) and it's the best scrub
killing Julia move IMO and you can mixup high, low and mid. Good
players will take this apart on non CH yet again as it's not that fast.
This is the tequila sunrise combo of choice as it's easily the most
damaging and this can total around 80 damage when you add the juggle
damage but it doesn't change the fact that is not a good move realy.
It's not even good for OB traps anymore this was awesome in T3 d+1,WS+
2,4,1,d,d,d/f+1,2,f,f+1,4 did almost 100 damage and it never whiffed
but again it sucks ass now. And it can hit the big characters I went
off tequila sunrise combos for okizemie long ago.


b+3                     Liquid Sweep                  l        TS PLDc
<iLuvMomo>
I have to admit that I prolly have been TOO hard on this move
initially. Anyone would be put away by this move anyways just by
looking at the frame data. 27 frames to hit (thats slower than Kazuya's
f+1+2), with -33 frames disadvantage when it is blocked. -33 frames you
say? YES.... thats a lot of painful stuff guranteed. For Jin thats free
WS+2 and Laser cannon juggle. Should it hit, Julia tripstuns her
opponent and is at a frame ADVANTAGE (+2) and she has the advantage,
and use one of her many FC mixups whether it be FC,df+4,3, WS+2,1,1 or
even a plain ol' hopkick. Your opponent is in a disadvantage and
anything he tries can be snuffed out easily with d+1. However b+3 is
not without its good points. When performing b+3, Julia ducks so low
that high attacks will miss her. Julia will take duck quite low to the
ground, before reaching all out to sweep her opponent. At the apex of
the sweep, Julia may even duck some mid attacks. On CH this trips and
Julia can follow up with FC+4,3, f,f+1, d,df+1,2 juggle which needless
to say does shitloads. In this sense, b+3 is extremely risky, but the
risk pays off handsomely.  Besides that, b+3 can be used in Okizeme,
where Julia needs just that extra reach. Be CAREFUL though. Because of
the slow startup b+3 has, your opponent can roll out of the way or even
hit you with an attack of his own. The good thing though is that if he
tries to rise with a high attack, you will most likely duck under him
and CH him. Juggle time! Also unlike some moves which have extremely
long recovery when blocked, b+3 does not have a long WIFF animation.
Therefore, b+3 is OKAY if you throw it out for spacing reasons. Overall
though b+3 is not a bad move, but neither is it an extremely good move.
It is okay if you pull it off once in a while, especially when your
opponent is tagging in, much like Kazuya's f+1+2, but don't abuse this
move like crazy. As Dim_sim said, "Just don't revolve your game around
it"

<DayFul>
Ok I said this was realy shit in a thread recently, I think it's just
so slow it's not realy shit it's a case of use it at the right time.
Only use this unless you are 100% certain you will hit -33 block
advantage is hideous. If you are up against a Mishimas player who likes
1,1,2 this will become a very effective move as you will be able to CH
them and get a free juggle. If you hit this on non CH you can buffer
FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 it's interuptable but then you could mix it up with
WS+4. I'm not sure if d+1 has the priority to beat it out though it
will conect 1 frame before WS+4 but priority does come in to play. I
wouldn't use this for okizemie personaly as FC,d/f+4 is better it has a
bit more range and comes out considerably faster off the fake low
parry. Overall this is a good move if you know when to use it it goes
under high and even some mid attacks so you need to read you opponent
well to use this effecitvely.


uf+3+4                  Earthquake Stomp              M
<iLuvMomo>
What is this? A world series of bad moves? Sometimes I really feel like
changing my policy of not rating moves and just give all Julia's move a
bad rating. This move is almost worthless in 99.999999999% of the
situations. Julia doesn't even track well with this move. In fact she
can't even judge her distance properly. Imagine your opponent lying
next to you. you do earthquake stomp..... Julia jumps.. she lands.....
and MISSES your opponent. LOL. When you do this move you are asking
your opponent to back throw you. Although stated in Pmartin's Changs
FAQ that you can use this to knock opponents in stance from mid range
like Ling in AOP. Any one who plays a decent Ling will know that Ling
can go in and out of AOP (as well as into other stances) with ease and
easily sidestep the Earthquake stomp. The only use I have found so far
for the earth quake stomp is after certain tag throws like Paul's f,f+1
+2 throw for instance. It works much like PJack's stomp in this
case.... only without the *crunch* to it. Not sure if its guranteed but
I will check it out soon. As an okizeme attack, you must be able to
judge your distance carefully and be very very sure that your opponent
is going to lay still on the ground. A good note though, is that onec
Julia is airborne, its almost impossible to avoid the uf+3+4. By
training your opponent to fear you rushing in with your okizeme and
thus laying still, the Earthquake stomp can be used to great effect.
Also after her Heaven cannon unblockable, assuming you are an idiot who
can't juggle to save your life (or you just wanna prove to a scrub that
you can be scrubbier) then do the Earthquake stomp. It is GURANTEED
after the f+1+4 if timed correctly.

<DayFul>
There is only one time you should use this, after Paul's f,f+1+2 tag
throw where it's garunteed for some very good damage Outside that use
never use this as it's even crappier than the ultimate cannon IMO. I
was origionaly in favour of rating moves but iLuvMomo wanted to do it
this way, but he is right it's blatantly obvious that a move is
incredibly bad. Yea this is garunteed after a f+1+4 but how often will
you hit that on a good player? And this is pathetic for okizemie it's
so slow I mean there's hardly a deer in the headlights effect like
kings moonsault is there? If you want to knock Ling out of AOP use d/f+
4 much safer and has more than enougth range to be safe.


3+4                     Counter Clockwise Spin        n/a
<iLuvMomo>
Finally a decent move to talk about. This move is a classic Michelle
move since the Tekken 2 days. Then it was a real big advantage to
Michelle since it was the sole sidestep move in the game (other than
Kazuya's Mist step) However, with the addition of Sidesteps for every
character one may think that 3+4, the Spin, is useless now. Undoubtedly
when used by itself, it definitely is, since moves generally track
quite a bit better now in TTT. However the beauty of the Spin is when
it is used in conjunction with her Sidestep move. As such you can
perform her double and triple sidestep. Admittedly though, her double
and triple sidestep does not cover as much range as that of say
Hwoarang, but it is extremely useful to run circles round your opponent
and get behind them. Also another bad point about the Spin is that she
only spins to her right and as such to be used effectively Julia has to
Sidestep right (SSR) Although this may not prove to much a problem
since most powerful moves (WGF, deathfist, etc) are sidestepped usually
to the right (you actually can sidestep to the left though your time
has to be excellent) you could find yourself eating 1,1,2 shining fists
if you are not careful. Still the drawbacks are not enough to stop any
good Julia player from using this move. You can cancel 3+4 into her
Razor kick (4,4) combinations which makes the SSR, 3+4 combinations
even more lethal since you can get behind your opponents with ease and
get a guranteed 4,4,1 plus juggle. Evil damage.  Besides you will have
to rely a lot on your SS & 3+4 combo to cause confusion to your
opponent. Also remember that SS can be cancelled automatically with 1~
1,1 or 1~2,1 unlike Michelle which has to cancel the sidestep manually.

<DayFul>
This is very useful when you combine it with Julia's SS as you can get
round your opponent quickly. it doesn't travel far but it is best
combined with her SS, it can serve as a buffer tool similar to her
command low parry but it's not as safe. It can link it to the spinning
kick chains so you can do plenty of damage off the 3xSS after using
this smack them with 4,4,1 and juggle them for a nice 90+ damage. It's
a good okizemie tool as well as you can get round your opponent to set
up an OB trap once you train your opponent to stay down since you have
so many ways of punishing them. It only spins to the right sadly you
can actualy use consecutive spins using one the following two methods
first you can spin then hold F to carry on another spin and do that as
long as you feel the need too (Not long I hope). Altenately use the
spin and hold B, this causes you to travel less forward, strange
movement learn to use it and it can be useful for confusion (Well I'll
have to explain how to confuse I'll get to that with mad axe setups
hint). So what does this mean? well as you can tell from that method I
given you can cancel the recovery of the 3xSS. Instead of being
restricted to the spinning kick strings you could use a d+1 if your
opponent tries to punish the high 4 that starts the spinning kick
strings or you could use 1,2,1 so it's not as restrictive as it may
appear, so in fact this is a great buffer for standing moves as long as
you use it at the right distance. This can be used as a tag cancel
which can be handy if you opponent tries to punish your tag in. Another
good use for this is if you are at mid distance the axis that this spin
travels in will bring you a bit closer to your opponent so why not
buffer mad axes out of it? Recently that's become one of my favourite
buffers very hard to see coming.

<iLuvMomo>
You'd notice I have grouped all 3 moves together in one lump sum.
Although d+4,1 and d+4,4 may have its use in combos, even d+4 should
not be used at all in normal gameplay. Why? d+4 is so slow, 20 frames.
Even if it hits you are at -10 disadvantage which in fact means your
opponent will get a FREE d+1. Why would you want to get into Crouched
position using d+4? d+1, d+2 heck even d+3 prove to be better options
when you want to get into FC position due to their speed and/or their
range. Being slow is one thing, the main problem though is that Julia
telegraphs d+4 as if she is screaming to her opponent "PARRY ME" Of
course good players will undoutedly snatch the opportunity to parry the
low kick (or at lesat block it) There is no saving grace either in her
follow ups. NOTHING is guranteed if d+4 counterhits. If your opponent
blocks the low kick he will opt to remain crouched since he can block
the low kick and duck the high kick. So you ask "What bout the mid
hitting Razor's Edge?" Unfortunately the Razor's edge is slow and any
good player will be able to block it on reaction (not that you need
much reaction) Getting d+4 and 1 followups blocked is definitely not
good news since the recovery is awesomely bad. At least with d+4 it
pushes your opponent somewhat away. Therefore unless you really need to
use this in juggles, stay clear of all the above moves.

<DayFul>
d+4,1 is Good for okizemie as it will catch rolling opponents but you
have the mountain crusher to do that, as I mentioned earlier use this
after FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 and you can flip your opponent over and get more
free hits so for that purpose this is excellent. On its own if the d+4
is slow and the 1 has horrible lag so you want to use this sparingly if
at all Julia has better options. d+4,N+4 is an okay jugle ender if you
want to add a bit of variety F+2,f,f,N+1,d+4,N+4 does 31 damage pretty
solid, not as good as them long elbow juggles but elbows get VERY
boring after a while. O and the mixup potential of d+4,d+4 and d+4,1 is
pathetic don't even think about it. Outsde okizemie and juggles don't
use any of these.


4,4                     Spinning Razor's Kick         h,l      RC
<iLuvMomo>
I feel that the initial 4,4 deserves special mention here. High kick
into razor kick is extremely useful as a chip away move, at least from
scrub to intermediate level. The Razor Kick comes out exceptionately
fast so much so that it will almost always hit your opponent. Even if
the low kick hits, and with the -3 frame disadvantage, your opponent
will be fearing the low kick razor edge mix up, and thus the FC
position that you are in is very suitable to create even more confusion
with her FC/WS mix up game.
At advanced or higher level of play the high kick to razor kick is
almost useless. In the good ol Tekken 3 days when not every one had a
low parry, this move could be abused a lot. However with the addition
of universal low parry, good players will almost always parry (or
block) the low kick which leaves Julia in a huge disadvantage? Why?
Because most of the time when 4,4 is used, Julia will be outside poke
range, and decent players will usually try two or three standing 4's in
hope of catching an onrushing player on CH. As such, when one sees the
standing 4, he will go immediately into crouched (or df) and thus
neutralize the razor kick. You prolly could get away with 4,4 against a
good opponent if you train your opponent to block high so much so that
he forgets that 4,4 even exists, and thats where Julia's elbow strings
come into play. Also I forgot to mention that 4,4 can be a decent
Okizeme attack since the low hitting razor kick comes out faster than
it would for d+4.

<DayFul>
The 4,4 is okay for tick damage as long as you use it sparingly as your
opponent knows the next hit is low so it's not something you want
to abuse. This is an okay way to get in to FC mixups your opponent will
probobly block high mostly as the 1 ender is definitely the one you
don't want to get hit by so FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 is your best followup. And
yes that generic d/f low parry has made this much more risky to use you
could pound Jin with this without fear in T3 as he couldn't parry it
but but you can't throw this out at will anymore. This is handy in
okizeme if you 3xSS your opponent you can set them up for an OB trap
with the second hit and juggle with the 1 ender.

 = d+4                  = Low Kick                    l
<iLuvMomo>
The high kick and low kick follow ups are just UTTER CRAP. If your
opponent is at intermediate level, you could prolly win a match with
4,4,d+4 but since a good player would have already parried the razor
kick, the follow ups here are practically USELESS. If 4 CH's though the
last kick will hit so you get 4,(4),4 but if 4 CH's you'd be better off
with elbow juggles.

<DayFul>
Well the 4,4,4 is very bad I mean it hits high it's the most powerful
variation but it will never hit trust me. The pay off for both are not
good enougth for the inferior reward. And well two consecutive low
attacks give me a break it's easy to tell between this and the 1 ender
so your opponent won't have much trouble parrying the low ender
assuming they haven't paried the second hit which they normaly will.


4,4,1                   Spinning Razor's Kick         h,l      RC
                        Razor's Edge                  m
<iLuvMomo>
I believe 4,4,1 deserves special recognition. As a move on its own, it
is equally as crap (or worse) than 4,4,4_d+4. However when used in
conjunction with her double/triple sidestep to get behind your
opponent, this move ROCKS. Since Julia does not have SS+3,4 which
Michelle has, 4,4,1 is the replacement juggle starter for her. When
done behind your Opponents bare back (which happens often with Julia)
they will get their assed launched, and you can follow up with a simple
f,f+1, 1, d+4,1 juggle. To see this technique in action, download Shafi
vs Shauno Semi Finals 2 at www.electriccancel.com. Laugh at this
Analquin. I bet Anna's SS+3 rulz Right?

<DayFul>
Now how many people are going to get hit by the second 4 when you know
the second hit it low? It's going to get parried often. But if your
opponent is slow to block this is your best option, mix it up with d+4
and 1 and you can have modest success (It's still a bit slow). If you
hit the 1 you will be able to smack an extra 40 damage on the end do
not abuse this as it has very bad lag when blocked. This is very good
off the 3x sidestep though, the spacing is tricky but the payoff is
huge just restrict the use of this to 3xSS and it's a very good move.
And yes this is another technique that Shafi uses to great effect in
the EC vids. Actualy this combined with 3xSS is far better than
Michelle's SS+3,4 so why the big fuss about it Julia doesn't need it,
3xSS 4,4,1 more damaging and it's far more realible too. (iLuvMomo's
note: Because SS+3,4 if blocked is extremely safe, but if 4,4,1 is
blocked, and seldom happens unless you are not careful, will get you
into big trouble)


b+4                     Heaven Shatter Kick           h        CSc
<iLuvMomo>
For one moment, imagine Yoshi's b+1+4 Yoshi flash. Now take away all
the good points of the move (speed,unblockable) and add all the bad
points of this move (absolute lack of range, hits high) and there you
have it. Another brand NEW absolutely useless Julia move. When you do
look at the frame data you will notice that it is a 14 frame move,
which would genrally be very good, but Yoshi's flash is only 4 frames
damn it! Well thats the general opinion people have on this move. I
noticed that none of the good players actually use this move.... except
in one particular movie, a1 of the Japan Honor Videos in which the
Changs player used this move a few times. Undoubtedly this was
intentional use of the move. Therefore with this in mind, I discussed
this move (along with several others) with a few people. On one hand
some said the move was terrible, a travesty to Julia, but a few other
people also praised this move saying it is a very very underated move.

So whats good about this move? Absolutely no range, hits high and
rather slow for a move thats supposed to counter? I also did not
mention that the Heaven shatter kick is COMPLETELY safe even when it is
blocked with a paltry -7 frame disadvantage. If you hit with it on a
normal hit you get a +4 frame advantage, which does not gurantee
anything be allows Julia to keep on the offensive. Besides,the Heaven
shatter kick has a weird property of it that it ducks high attacks
during certain frames of its animation. In fact it does go under
certain mids. This ducking property will prove EXTREMELY useful against
pitbulling opponents who rely a lot on their standing 1's and 4's (e.g
Changs, Laws etc.) Why not 1~1,1 you say? Take a instance where Law and
Julia match. Well if both were to hit 1 at the very same instant (Julia
aiming for 1~2,1 Law aiming for 1,2 punches), both will get hit and you
gain nothing. Instead if you try b+4 instead, it will duck under your
opponent's high poke and CH him. Another instant where b+4 is rather
useful is against opponents who have habit of rising with a standing
kick. In this case, I suggest that you run up to your opponent, SS a
lil and b+4 him. 9 out of 10 times, it will either hit him before he is
able to hit you, or duck under the kick, both of which will land a CH.
Thanks to Catlord for confirming this.

On CH, Heaven shatter kick will crumple stun your opponent, a stun
which is NOT escapable. As Shafi (Redfoot) put it to me, and I quote
"Basically its a risk vs reward question, and I think its worth the
risk. A stun on CH is way worth it, especially for Julia."  Indeed,
after the CH stun you can get combos that are so damaging they are
insane! Anything as stupidly easy as d+1, WS+2,2 to Julia's Wondercombo
is possible which makes you and I wonder WHY we did not notice this
move in the first place.

<DayFul>
This is slow 14 frames (Used to think 17 so it doesn't sound as bad
now). It has EXTREMELY poor range, however if this CH's you can do a
very large amount of damage b+4,f+1+2,f,f,N+1,f,f,N+1,d,d/f+1,2 does
huge damage, more than her wonder juggle need I say more? But how are
you going to CH with a move like this? Well it avoids high attacks yes
the range sucks but if your opponent sticks a lot of jabs and standing
4's this is very handy. In fact of all the moves Julia has that avoids
high attacks this is the fastest and second in damage only to f+1+2 but
that has a far less relible evasive ability. It's also very handy in
side f+1+2 juggles which can happen once in a while and it flips your
opponent over for a large amount of elbows. Note how the stun won't
happen on the side which is a pain you have a very nice frame advantage
after it though. On paper this is a crappy move but the simple fact is
I do get CH b+4's. It's safe when blocked and it has a short whiff
animation as well. O and seen as it gives a +4 frame advantage mad axes
yet again, you may as well it's 60+ damage and well it will make this a
high damaging move on non CH as well.


df+4<2<b,f+1            Mountain Crusher              m,m,m    GS
<iLuvMomo>
Julia's Mountain crusher is EASILY one of her best new moves in TTT.
The addition of Mountain crusher easily takes away the burden of having
to do extremely hard juggles after her bow and arrow juggles. In fact
now with the Mountain crusher, you can do simple damaging juggles
without having to master multiple elbows. On further inspection, the
purpose of Mountain crusher is easily MORE than just a combo ender. I
have broken the move into three parts and examined them in more detail.

df+4 of Mountain crusher is extremely useful. Because of Julia's range,
or lack of, df+4 will be like a shield to her every time she throws it
out. A lot of people say that Julia's Mountain crusher should only be
used in combos and not in open play. This is certainly not the case.
df+4 is an excellent keep away move for Julia and will be used in open
play a lot. It is essential for Julia to use df+4 for keep away games
especially against equally good pokers like Michelle, Law and Lee. On
CH, 2 is guranteed (though b,f+1 is not) df+4 is very very very safe to
throw out just for the heck of it because you can delay the 2 (and hope
for CH and guranteed b,f+2) buffer Mad axes into it or just stop and
start another of Julia's string. Also because of its speed (14 frames)
it is extremely useful in Okizeme or OB trap (though d+1 IMO is still
better) Although df+4 isn't exactly Jin's b+4 it will "pick up" any
opponent who tries rolling on the ground for a free df+4,2,b,f+1. Thats
almost 50 points!! df+4 can also be used in certain combos to float her
opponent much like df+4 of the Mishima's. Combo starters like Bryan's
b+1 for example will cause Julia's opponent to bounce on the ground and
as such won't be able to techroll. When Julia tags in she is able to
lift her opponent up with df+4 and either finish up her Mountain
crusher or do multiple elbow juggles instead.

2 in Mountain crusher is also quite useful. Although when blocked, it
offers, -9 frame disadvantage, b,f+1 will beat out ANY attack your
opponent tries to throw in to interrupt it as long as you do not delay
b,f+1. Besides that, your opponent also suffers a small stun after
blocking 2. Also like df+4, you can buffer the Mad Axes throw after it
since most players will be in defensive mode anticipating b,f+1. Mixing
up Mad Axes after df+4 and df+4,2 or not at all will drive your
opponent up the walls especially since Mad Axes has such a small escape
frame.

Lastly b,f+1. Although you actually are in -15 frames disadvantage,
Julia knocks her opponent away far enough that she is relatively safe.
Long pokes like Kuma/Panda's f+1 will still hit her, but she won't be
in range for EWGF, Devil's TP or Deathfist if b,f+1 is blocked at
maximum range. However I seldom finish of MC with b,f+1 unless I'm sure
that 2 hits on CH. b,f+1 will knock your opponent far away if it hits
giving Julia a safe opportunity to tag out of required. Oh yeah and I
think it should be notated as b<f+1 since thats the proper way to delay
the last hit of the MC, but I still stick to b,f+1 as stated in
Zaibatsu. Oh and remember to buffer chicken for all the hits,
especially the last one since scrubs will more than often reverse it.

<DayFul>
Definitely Julia's best new move, a contender for the best new move in
TTT (Hei's EWGF doesn't count EWGF isn't new). First this is Julia's
best juggle ender it's not hard to learn to delay the 1 on the end. And
it all hit's mid so it's hard to punish. Very very good okizemie tool
as well the d/f+4 will catch rolling opponents Although it's best if
you use FC,d/f+4,3 and put this on the end for an easy 40+ damage. It
is probably the safest okizemie move in the game Lei's play dead is
very well tamed by this d/f+4 beats out anything he can do from it. Ok
you could argue d+1 but what happens if Lei uses 3+4 will d+1 beat it
out I'm pretty sure it doesn't. But the range of the d/f+4 gives it a
big advantage anyay. The d/f+4 is much better than the generic d/f+4
and as I mentioned in the throw section this is one of the most
effective OB trap moves it's got better range than d+1 but when it
whiff it's not too good. If the d/f+4 CH's the 2 is guaranteed and if
the 2 CH's (Won't happen often) the 1 is guaranteed. The 1 has bad
recovery time it does push your opponent far back though. But anyway
that d/f+4 the range is sick the distance you opponent stands from you
at the beginning of the round is enougth for this to connect, the range
can realy hamper some characters for example your against Michelle ok
Julia is at her best up close but Michelle has so many weapons her non
knockdown elbow her SS+2. It's boring as hell but just keep her out of
range and she is realy disadvantaged she can't even use her elbows as
the distance will simply allow you a free CH and 2 followup for a handy
30 damage+mixup with b,f+1 and mad axes. The d/f+4 is near abusable it
doesn't track well but you should be using it at range 2 as a keep away
move. Don't overestimating the reach yes it is realy good but don't get
carried away. Do be wary that this tracks like shit so don't use all
the hits unless your opponent screams CH me.


FC,df+4,3               Bow and Arrow                 l,m
<iLuvMomo>
The classic Changs move. If the Bow kick hits, arrow is guranteed
except if your opponent is Ling, you are off axis or the bow kick hit
at maximum range (seldom though) Should her Arrow get blocked or wiff
Julia is left quite open to quick counter attacks (twin pistons,
shining fist, throws) The Bow and Arrow is a wonderful WONDERFUl move
though for Julia since it can be used in so many occasions. As an
Okizeme move, Bow and Arrow will give your opponent a one way ticket to
Major Hurt. If your opponent lies still, you can just FC,df+4 and do
some decent damage and knock him away. Should he roll, FC,df+4,3 WILL
float and you can follow that up with Mountain crusher for oodles of
damage. Also since Bow and Arrow is an attack from FC position it is
extremely useful in her mix up game. FC,df+4 has good range and is a
useful tick attack at intermediate level though good opponents will
undoubtedly parry/ block it. Also with her low thrust (fake low parry)
the Bow and arrow kick has a higher chance to connect since it comes
out more deceptively and your opponent has to worry about other mix
ups. FC,df+4,3 will float in certain situations like after a blocked
tag slide (or slide in general) and when you get up from the ground
with a rising sweep. And this is of course part of Julia's "Wonder
Combo". If used against reversal scrubs, remember to buffer chicken for
the last hit since it is always reversed.

<DayFul>
Very useful off the fake low parry and one of the moves you should use
a lot off it. The FC,d/f+4 has excellent range and it very good for
okizemie because of how safe it is. This also plays a part in Julia's
wonder juggle so you have to like this move. It's an excelent okizemie
move it can float your opponents if they try to roll stick an MC on the
end for some very good damage. Another big plus this has is the range,
you can use this in okizemie from a good distance away and stay safe
from your opponents attacks (Very good against Lei's play dead game I
would prefer this to d/f+4 is I'm not in close). The 3 will sometimes
miss Xiaoyu and Roger if you hit it up close the 3 will connect you
need to learn the spacing (Practice on the PS2). If the first hits the
2nd is guaranteed on the characters not mentioned earlier so this is
important to get in some easy damage especialy if you train your
opponent to block high (Remember you have an FC mixup with WS+4 and
u/f+4 so they have to realy on reaction to block this. The recovery on
the 3 is realy bad however but it's pretty easy to determine wether the
4 has connected soit's easy to know when you should use the 3 ender.


(FC_d)+(1+3_2+4)        Low Parry                     n/a
<iLuvMomo>
This move is too useful to be here. As such I have dedicated a nice
meaty section of this FAQ to this move alone. Refer on this in
"Setups" Also Julia can cancel her tag in with a low parry, and make
her less vulnerable to low hitting attacks.

<DayFul>
The command low parry got raped in TTT, Julia had so many awesome
followups in T3 you could parry a d+1 jab and get a free 70 damage
combo. But anyway the strength of this is that you have so many options
in this you can use the fake low parry (There's a section on that
later). This is a great way of putting someone on the defensive that
allows you to use mad axes with even less risk than before (If that was
possible).


2+3+4                   Wave Taunt                    n/a
<iLuvMomo>
It's a taunt. And well... unlike some taunts, it doesn't hit which
makes it useless even in show off combos. It does have a certain use
though. Like Dayful says, you can tag cancel using 2+3+4 taunt and
immediately cancel the taunt without the danger of getting CH. However,
throwing this out once in a while could be useful to mock your
opponent. If I ever throw out this move, I'm telling my opponent "You
Suck"

<DayFul>
Dam I love this move ;P. This is the coolest taunt in the game by a
mile it's so cheeky ok you can't taunt juggle but it looks funny.
Anyway a very good use of this is it can tag in cancel you can cancel
the taunt straight away using 2+3+4~b. I personaly find it easier than
the u~u/b version so if you aren't too hot with the u~u/b tag cancel
use this instead. Also you can cancel this with a 1 so if your opponent
is realy dumb taunt them and if they try something like a deathfist
bust out a 1~2~1 and maybe they'll let you do the whole thing. But this
is a brilliant taunt it's a game after all Julia is one of the most fun
charctaers to play IMO so that's what this is for fun. Very handy in
mind games also if your opponent is turtling just keep a safe distance
and taunt them you never know they may try something stupid if not it
still looks good.


Unblockable:
------------

Command            Name                             Property

f+1+4              Heaven Cannon                    *!*
<iLuvMomo>
As an Unblockable goes, Heaven cannon ranks high up there with other
unblockables. As a move goes though, it is well after all an
unblockable, not that its useless or anything. Heaven Cannon alone does
50 points alone. Pretty little for an unblockable. The beauty of it
though is the possible juggles Julia is able to perform should the
Heaven Cannon hit. f+1+4 acts as a Class 1 launcher for Julia, even
though she cannot tag out of it. Julia can do some MEGA damaging
juggles like UF,N+4, f,f+1, f,f+1, d,df+1,2 or even something
mindlessly easy like uf+3+4. However the main problem with Julia's
f+1+4 is that of all unblockables. It takes forever to wind up. Julia's
make rank as one of the faster unblockables there is, but it still is
extremely slow. It's reach is exceptionately good and it does have semi
tracking ie she will track before she starts charging at you. The
charge acts much like her f+1 uppercut only that it has WAY much more
range which will definitely catch people unfamiliar with the range.
Besides a lot of unblockables has that "FREEZING" property in which
even good players just stop and eat the unblockable. Do not be hesitant
to use this move, especially when you know that you have the round
lost. After all you have nothing to lose. Also, Julia's unblockable
will hit grounded big opponents. Therefore it is deadly especially in
combos like Devil SS+2~5, tag cancel, f+1+4 (not guranteed though).

<DayFul>
Pretty good tag in punisher due to the range and speed it has. Julia
can hit this and a 50+ damage juggle after it and it's considerably
faster than other unblockables and has a lot more range. This hit's the
big guys when they are on the floor but don't use it often Julia has
safer okizemie options than this. I noticed this won't hit Ganny on the
floor so be wary of that. If your opponent tag cancels and this whiffs
you are completely screwed so you would be better off using something
safer, a scrub punshier if nothing else Eddy mashers have a magnet to
this one. Basicly how slow is this? 67 frames now think we have been
talking about something like b+3 being slow at 27 frames well this
takes more than twice as long to do so you could do far beter than to
keep away from this a simple d/f+2,1 and juggle has damage that can
rival this fairly well. If your opponent is dumb enougth to use the
Devil/Kazuya team you can hit them with this in the morph animation
with the right spacing but I think everyone knows that team sucks now.
For a while I was VERY disapointed with Julia's class 1 juggles, I was
hoping I could stick the wonder juggle in after an u/f+4 you can use
u/f+4,FC,d/f+4,3,d/f+4,2,b<f+1 thanks to Muzzy for that one, sick
stuff.


Pre-Canned Ten Hit Strings
--------------------------
<iLuvMomo>
One word to describe all three of them "USELESS". Learn how to block
and punish them. 10-strings are Scrub killers so use them unforgivingly
against eddy scrubs. The best one would prolly be 2,1,1,2,3,3,2,1,4,3
since they never learn how to block low. Forget about even trying this
against good players. Stick to custom strings since they are much more
effective.

<DayFul>
Well how many different languages do I need to say 10 hit are gay in?
never never use them. Ok scrubs can't block them but it's a sick joke
people take the time to learn this crap. Well I learned the hard way 10
hits suck and guess what the A.I punished me LOLOLOL well I guess the
A.I does serve a purpose. O and remember the 1,2,2,1,3,3,3,4,4,1 the
9th hit will usualy whiff on the big guys, the last hit of the one
iLuvMomo mentioned above will miss Ling and Roger. Have I convinced you
these suck ass yet I don't know why Namco put these in. (iLuvMomo:
Because they want to feed to scare away the pros with 10 hit scrubs)


***************
Julia's Juggles
***************
Well there are loads and out of all of these you won't use 80% of them
but using the same juggles over and over is dull. The wonder juggle is
so boring now I can play TTT at my leisure I see far too much of it.
The majority of these from Castels combo list There are a few missing
ones I have added in From Catlord's combo compendium. Note that these
combos include big character juggles which explains the 7 elbow juggles
so until Castel updates his Julia juggle list you'll have to do without
big character juggle notations unfortunately.

The damage is calculated on the principle that the first hit does 80%
of its normal damage and all hits after do 50% these may be off by a
point or two due to rounding. I'll have the true damage read outs in
later revisions.

Thee's a section at the end for some unlisted juggles me and iLuvMomo
have found and a couple of side 1~1,1 juggles courtesy of Devil
hopefully I'll have a few more to add in later revisions.

DayFul's favorite juggles
-------------------------

1) u/f+4,d+2,d/f+4,3,d/f+4,2,b>f+1
Julia's wonder juggle everyone knows this one even scrubs take the time
to learn it such is the ease of use and awesome damage this does. It's
very easy and this is a killer with Netsu I just wish you could add
this on the end of Bruces 3,2,1 (Yes it's taggable as some peole aren't
aware of) that would be so cheap though.

2) 1,2,1,f,f,f+1,f,f,N+1,f,f,N+1,d,d/f+1,2
Slightly more damage than the f,f,N+1 x3,d,d/f+1,2 that most people use
but I'm so used to the running 1 after 1,2,1 from T3. My only prob with
this is that dam d,d/f+1 maybe it's just my prob but if you have it
down use this to keep Julia interesting.

3) 1,2,1,f,f,d+1,d/f+4,3,f/f+4,2,b>f+1
Get this down and your Julia will becombe much more scary it's not easy
to get the d+1 every time but this is overall easier to do than the
above juggle once you get to it and the damage is better.

4) f+1,f,f,N+1,f,f,N+1,f,f,N+1,f,f,N+1,f,f+1,4
Easy this is your safer option than the juggles involving d,d/f+1 the
damage is the same and this is much easier to pull off. Also this has
huge air time so if your tag partner has taken a beating this is very
handy.

5) CH f+1+2,u/f+4,f,f,N+1,f,f,N+1,d,d/f+1,2
Style points and this will take off a hell of a lot of health you won't
hit many CH f+1+2 but when you do the damage is awesome for a move that
is safe unless whiffed.

6) d,d/f+(1)<2(CH) d/f+2,1,f,f,d+1,d/f+4,3,d/f+4,2,b<f+1
Same as the 1,2,1 juggle, note this can be escaped but if your opponent
doesn't escape the stun they'll have to learn very quickly as this does
sick damage.

7) Any class 1 juggle starter u/f+4,FC,d/f+4,3,d/f+4,2,b<f+1
One word owwwwww, master this juggle. (iLuvMomo's Note: You need to tag
cancel if you wanna hit the uf+4)

8) 1~1,1 F+2,d,d/f+1,f,f,N+1,d,d/f+1,2
On a good day I'll slam this on you this is Julia's strongest 1~1,1
juggle and it looks very stylish. Not an easy one to get but there
simply isn't a stronger more stylish 1~1,1 juggle for Julia.

iLuvMomo's Favourite Juggles
----------------------------
I don't really do a huge variety of juggles myself unlike with Kazuya,
which is ironic really since Kazuya has a smaller movelist. Well here
are the ones which I like to do and Dayful hasn't mentioned.

1) b+4 (CH), df+4, f,f+1, f,f+1, d,df+1,2
Very easy. Doesn't do as much as Wondercombo off b+4 though, but sure
looks cool. Another plus to this combo is that it can be done on both
small and big characters.

2) b+4 (CH) Wonder juggle
This is very typical. However a thing to note though is that if you are
attempting the wonder juggle on small sized characters (ie Julia, Ling)
you have to dash in a bit after CH b+4 and d+1 your opponnent. If you
don't either d+1 or MC will wiff (the latter being extremely bad)

3) CH Shoulder ram (WR), d,df+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, d,df+1,2
This is way cool. Too bad I don't get much opportunities to try this
combo. But give it a try. It works ;)

4) SSR CH f+1+2, b+4, f,f+1 x3, df+4,2,b<f+1 (big)
Do note that you can attempt up to 9 elbows on a fatty, but I guess I
will just finish it off with a Mountain crusher for a safe chunk of
damage. b+4 should flip your opponent over after the SSR CH f+1+2.

5) uf+4, f,f+1 x6
On normal characters 6 elbows is the maximum number of elbows (I think
you can get) There is a video of this in TZ, Julia act.1 where Castel
performs this. Actually at first I thought it was quite difficult till
I tried it. Gotta love elbows.

6) CH 1~1,1, 1,2,4
If your sticks are really screwed up, just do this. Safe, does good
damage and you won't need to move at all.

7) Bryan, b+1(~5), df+4, f,f+1, f,f+1, d,df+1,2
Almost the same as CH b+4 only that you need to time the df+4 properly
so as not to do it too early before you are near your opponent. Other
than that, it should be no probs.

8) Devil SS+2(~5), 2+3+4~f, f+1+4 (big)
Cool. Your opponent can't tag. He will be eating a nice fat 50 points
of damage. Tag cancel after tagging in. In fact throw in Julia's taunt
to tag cancel and hit them with f+1+4 unblockable. Cool!

9) Floor, 3, FC,df+4,3, MC
Be careful of your height after floored 3 sweep since if you may or may
not connect with the MC.

******
Setups
******
As everyone already knows (or at least SHOULD know) Julia is basically
a CH based character. For her to win she has to poke her way and hope
that she scores a few CH's in the process. This is due to the fact that
her lack of non CH launching moves like EWGF or df+2 uppercut or
powerhits like Deathfist, Demon's Paw f,f+2 etc. Instead her non CH
launching moves, f+1, df+2,1 and uf+4 are either slow or recover badly.
Her power move 1+2 is slow and lacks POWER. Anyways back to the main
story. To score CH's you either got to be very lucky or properly set up
moves so that you will have a better chance for CH.

To prevent some smart ass, anal, comments I have decided to list down
ALL the setup tools available, even ones which are extremely crappy. A
'*' denotes a setup move which is recommended. Also I have listed some
good (and not so good) follow ups.

I found that it would be extremely hard (and taxing) to review each
move and its setups one by one, so what I have done was group them up
seperately (thanks to RevC for this nice format of writing though I
still like your Old format better).

Group #1: Command Low parry, d+1+3_d+2+4
Group #2: Setup into FC position
Group #3: Throw/ CH bait
Group #4  Mad axes buffers

Group #1: Command Low parry, d+1+3_d+2+4
----------------------------------------

<iLuvMomo>
Although the Command Low parry has been toned down to near uselessness
as far parrying low attacks go with the addition of the universal Low
parry and the fact that it does not give the 20 frames which guranteed
a hopkick and juggle, it nevertheless is still a useful move in Julia's
arsenal. The Command Low Parry, sometimes nicknamed as Low thrust or
Fake low parry is THE best set up tool in my opinion since Julia has
almost an unlimited resource of moves which she can do after the low
parry. After a command low parry, you can do her FC/ WS moves, throw
another low parry, Buffer throws like Mad Axes, Cross Arm Suplex,
generic throws, hopkick or cancel every thing and CH with everyone's
favourite (or not so favourite) 1~1,1 or other pokes. Use the fake low
parry a lot because it will create total confusion for your opponent
not to mention whenever you use it, you are TOTALLY safe from ALL LOW
ATTACKS. For more fun, throw 2 to 3 consecutive low parries to confuse
your opponent even more.


<DayFul>
First off the method for executing standing moves out of the fake low
parry from jjt and KOFTEKKEN's advanced tekken guide. For standing
moves you have to input it as d+1+3_d+2+4 and you will be considerd
standing during the motion. For FC moves you have to input it as D+1+3
_D+2+4.
You are only vunerable for 2 frames (I'll have to check WTF the freeze
window is LOL) you can play on the lag of this as it can execute for
longer but you can cancel out of the whiff animation very quickly. This
is also excellent for putting your opponent on the defensive as you can
use your 1 out of this so they won't do anything silly. I'm going to
group what moves can u done through each method and a '*' indicates a
recommended move.


D+1+3_D+2+4
FC,d/f+4,3 '*'

The fake low parry can be used in some okizemie situation mainly when
you don't have the oppourtunity for an OB trap. It's an easy way to get
in to your FC mixups and overall the mixup of being able to use
standing and FC moves and having no way of distinguishing which group
of moves are going to be used. You can use the fake low parry in any
situation realy contarary to what some people believe, you can use this
in your opponent's face, Ling's b+1 will not interupt it during its
animation (I'd love to see who this guy plays can't be that good
realy). It's a very valuable move that should be a big part of any
Julia players game.


Group #2: Setup into FC position
--------------------------------

<at this point, iLuvMomo got lazy and left the Setups section for
Dayful>

-First she has 4,4 which won't be effective above intermediate level as
most people will parry the second 4. But it will be effective if you
opponent is not able to parry it (Scrubs).

-1~1,4 it's not as bad as you think as long as you use it sparingly
remember you have the mid hitting 1 to follow which will result in a
big fat elbow juggle. This gives you a nice frame advantage and it's
easy to buffer FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 out of it, you need to make sure you
are in ange as you aren't going to be if you use it too far out.

-FC,d/f+4 same deal as above but you can't buffer FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2
because your opponent will be pushed back. this will connect more often
than 1~1,4 this is best used against small characters when you hit them
at maximum distance.

-You can Recover crouching from her elbow (When blocked) by inputing
f,f,N+1~D. Her elbow leaves you at a small frame disadvantage but your
opponent has to be wary of the 4 ender. I'm sure you already realised
you will be using Julia's elbow a lot to pressure your opponent so it
will add a lot to Julia's mixups from her elbow.

-Non CH b+3 is very good also, unlike her elbow that leaves you at a -2
frame advantage this gives you a +2 frame advantage. WS+1 is very
useful here as you can buffer FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 which can be interupted
by d+1 but WS+1 will at worst give you a trade of hits but you'll get
more damage than your opponents d+1 anyway. You could use WS+4 or u/f+4
as well although they aren't as safe the payoff is good and they have
excellent priority (WS+4 blocked close up is very bad).

-d+1 is very safe for getting it to FC also it gives you a +9 frame
advantage, FC,1 is garunteed here. You have an uninteruptable
FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 and WS+4 and they are a good mixup you could play safe
with WS+1 which they must block high if they do anything else it will
hit.

-Fake low parry as you will know from the fake low parry section this
is much more than just an FC setup. It's a bit difficult to get in to
an FC mixup usualy because of the positioning that is required most of
the Fcmmoves are a bit slow and the success of them depends on the
mixup potential you have.


Group #3 Throw/CH bait
----------------------

* CH bait

1~1,1_1~2~1

There are a lot of scenarios when you can go for a CH 1 and it's one of
the most important CH moves you have.

-After a  blocked f,f,N+1 if your opponent tries to attack with
anything slower than an 8 frame jab or d+1 you can CH them. This works
well due to the possibility of the delay on Julia's elbow as there is a
whooping -17 frame disadvantage (Well sort of you can hit them with the
4 ender at any time).If your oponent wises up and tries to d+1 use the
4 ender as it's uninteruptable when done imidiately. If your up against
P-Jack just laugth your ass off as he has no d+1 it's a tile splitter,
d/b+1 is the machine gun blast which is a lot slower than d+1 and d/f+1
is that very slow uppercut type move (I suck at descriptions).

-Fake low parry is good here too but it's a bit of a turtle inducer IMO
but it's good to throw in there.

-You could CH through interupting an opponents strings but you need to
get to know where you can interupt (Baek's kick trings are not
adviseable). Most custom strings are good for this as a blocked move in
the custom string will leave you in a good position to CH them.

-Taunt tag cancel, very strange one this but if your opponent tries to
punish your tag in taunt and cancel it with 1~1,1 or 1~2~1 your
opponent will usualy use a slow power move to punish the tag in moves
like Kazuya's f+1+2 (May be better and safer blocked though, stick an
u/f+4 on him) and Paul's deathfist ect.

-You can throw out a couple of jabs in succession even when blocked,
you have no frame disadvantage so it's a safe one make sure yo don't
hit 1~1 though.

-Julia can go for CH 1's in her movement as well, the techniuqe for
this is best explained in Renick's Bryan FAQ known as stairs. The basic
idea of this is combining dashes, back dashes and SS keeping your
opponent off axis and getting CH's, this works well for 1 and 4. One
thing you should try to avoid, blindly running in and trying 1~2~1 it's
dumb and frankly scrubby. I went through that stage it works well on
scrubs but people who know Julia well know her well enough that she has
a d/f+1+2 and d/f+2,1 mixup to contend with and won't try anything
silly.


CH 4

-Her spin is an easy one to start with you are vunerable during the
spin but you can use it at range 3 or so and remember you aren't
commited to just the 4 you have a very good range of mixups.

-Fake low parry, this is served well due to the range her 4 has some
people just have to attack when you use it so if your opponent isn't in
range for a CH 1 this is your best option.

-Blocked 1, you have no frame disadvantage so it's a good setup don't
use it too much though you would be better off sticking an elbow in
there. Remember they're both mad axes setups so your opponent will
crouch fairly often.

-You can throw out a couple of 4's in sucession it has a very short
whiff animation so it's safe most effective when your opponent runs in
after the first 4 whiffs.

-As with the CH 1 setups this is easily incorporated in to your
sidestep, dashing and backdashing the added range makes this easier as
well.


CH f+1+2_b+4_b+3

Well this is more anticipation than a setup all of these moves are
fairly slow so it's difficult to setup. They all go under high attacks
which makes the job of CH in easier it's down to judgement here mainly.
f+1+2 is good off the SS as is b+4, it's not quite side more off axis
similar to the CH 1 and 4 setups covered earlier. If you hit f+1+2 at
the side it always launches so CH doesn't matter there. A CH b+4 at the
side will not give a CS sadly but you still have a nice frame advantage
I'm Not sure if the frame advantage is increased due to the CH but you
could hit them with 1~1,1 depending on how far you have go round your
opponent.


u/f+4

-Connecting with an u/f+4 is based mainly on your mixup game revolving
around mad axes setups. The difficulty some people have in escaping mad
axes eventualy causes them to crouch hoping to avoid mad axes instead.

-u/f+4 is a very good option off the fake low parry as you have d/f+4,3
and mad axes to mixup with and you can outpriorotise a lot of moves
anyway.

-You can incorporate u/f+4 in to your FC mixups so refer back to that
section for the various setups.

* Throw setups

I covered mad axes in a separate section due to the huge range of
mixups you have and a lot of them still apply here.

Generic throws
These are mainly to mixup with mad axes but not all mad axes buffers
will apply but here are the ones that are able to be mixed up with mad
axes.

1
4
2
d,d/f+1
d/f+4
f,f,N+1 (Blocked)
2+3
WS+1
b+4

The other buffer for mad axes are not possible due to the shorter range
than the generic throws have.

d/f+1+2
This has very poor range you mainly want to use this in your running
game. With this you can mixup with d/f+2,1 WR,1_2 all hit mid to deter
your opponent from crouching. This is a prime example of the cheap run
up throw okizemie situation that many people despise very effecive.

FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2
The FC setups section has all the nessecary references to the various
moves you can buffer this in to so here's a quick list just to keep it
all together. Not all the FC setups apply 4,4 1~1,4 and FC,d/f+4 will
push your opponent too far away.

d+1
Non CH b+3
Fake low parry
f,f,N+1~D

Group #4 Mad Axes
-----------------

Ok small contradiction on what iLuvMomo said in grouping moves but mad
axes does need it's own section due to the size of it. Expect many
updates to this section. For the time being I'm going to list the most
common setups and some more unfamilliar ones that I use frequently.

There are too many mad axes buffers, I'm not going through all of them
that would be inpractical and completely unnessecary these are just
buffers you will have the chance to use (For the thime being anyway
I'll certianly add more here). Also I feel that the most effective
buffers are fast mid hitting moves that have followups so it's
certianly worth looking at what other mixups are possible with bufers,
like Julia's SS game you need to improvise.

1
Simple and very easy to buffer mad axes in to a non CH 1, with this
your opponent can't realy crouch as you have the second 1 that hits
mid, the 1 is a bit easy to interupt though but this buffer is very
hard to see coming. After the 1 you could use f,f,N+1 after it to
discourage any attempts to avoid the throw, that would be better than
the 1 followup so 1,f,f,N+1 would be a handy short string to use and
after the elbow you could throw out another jab maybe mad axes your
opponent can't crouch as the 4 ender of the f,f,N+1 would result in
around 50 damage so this is realy useful.

4
Why not? A non CH 4 is very easy to buffer mad axes off and the damage
adds up very nicely there's no real mixup potential on this sadly but
this does very nice damage. I noticed that you will probobly have to
move forward very slightly it's barely noticeable but you are just out
of range to hit mad axes just get used to the forward movement and it
will be fine.

2
a +9 frame advantage mad axes is only 10 frames so this is a very good
mad axe buffer, you also have the 1 followup for the second hit of her
tenstring and it hits mid to discourage any crouching (Wow Julia's 10
string does have a use well 2 hits of it the damage is sad however).
The second hit of the tensting is weak but you could buffer mad axes in
to that as well so the first 3 hit's can be messed around but the 4th
is always high so it's not worth playing around with.

d,d/f+1
This is one of the best mad axes buffers you have it's very fast and
has a quick delayable mid hitting followup that stuns on CH. You could
even use the running version of this but if you have distance between
you and your opponent you have either knoked them down or your playing
Julia wrong

d/f+4
Like d,d/f+1 this is very good, it has a delayable mid hitting followup
that gives the b,f+1 ender garunteed if the 2 CH's so your opponent is
not going to try anything funny. The d/f+4 has very good range so you
can get plenty of these probobly your best option as d,d/f+1 isn't the
easiest move to get every time.

f,f,N+1
This is ideal as you have a mid hitting 4 followup and the oppourtunity
to go for a CH 1. And of course with this you can throw out a couple of
elbows in succession so your opponent is going to have to be ready to
break the throw at any time. There's very little risk remember you have
the uninteruptable 4 followup so they can't crouch can they?

2+3
You have a nice frame advantage after this and it very easy to buffer,
the ender for this takes a year to come out so it won't help any kind
of mixup game. 2+3 is more of a surprise move to throw out once every
so often so buffer mad axes and this can be useful but there is no
mixup here. Sadly though the 2 is Sm now so it's nowhere near as good
as it was it T3 just use the 2+3 every so often it's fairly safe when
blocked.

WS+1
If you connect with this you have a +8 frame advantage after it and its
much easier to buffer off this than 2. Only problem is the range is
pathetic but it's a 10 frame WS move so it will interupt a lot of
moves. (iLuvMomo: This Rulz! Watch this in the World Tourney vids!)

d/f+3
You could have hit with u/f+4 if you could have hit this normally. but
anyway this isn't bad for hitting techrollers so you will hit this once
in a while it's another easy one, it's not very fast and there isn't
much mixup potential but throw it in every so often as it makes things
much more dificult when getting up.

3~2
On non CH this is very effective why? you have two different mid hiting
options to chose from you wont hit many 3~2. It's a bit slow but this
is very effetive because of the mixup potential but you won't get many
oppourtunities to use it.

f+1+2
On normal hit you have a pretty good fame advantage and nice distance
to buffer mad axes out of. The damage on this is very good and in some
cases you could try this when blocked as you get a small guard stun and
push your opponent back but still in range to hit mad axes so that can
be useful as well.

d/f+1
Not very useful as this is so hard to hit and with the high risk you
would have been better off doing something else, but anyway this is a
case of its ability as a mad axes buffer. Well this has a mid hitting
followup and its easy to buffer just a shame it's such a bad move.

b+4
The distance for this is good but when you use this you noramly want to
intend it to CH so you won't get many chances to use this one. But if
you don't CH you have a +4frame advantage to use mad axes so it's worth
using.


Using mad axes in your movement
*******************************

First the most useful way of using mad axes movement wise is off the SS
you can SS then buffer QCB in to a back dash then hit them with mad
axes while they're out of range. You could also buffer QCB then SS in
to mad axes as the delay on the QCB motion is very big.

Mad axes is a good option when using the tried and tested okizemie
tactic of running up to your opponent and throwing them if they rise in
to a mid kick or rising sweep you can backdash and use mad axes there,
in that situation you can mixup with f+1+2 to discourage any crouching
u/f+4 is an even better option but not always safe.

iLuvMomo's Secret Tip:
----------------------
Big props goes to Shafi (Redfoot) for letting me know about this GREAT
property of Mad Axes. Not only can you SS during the motion of mad
axes. You can dash/ backdash during the motion or simply add a Neutral
(your character just pauses for a while). Hence QCB~f,f,N,F+2 or
QCB~b,b,N,F+2. Didn't know that? Well there is more, you can incoporate
dash/ backdash into Mad Axes buffer ALONG with SS. Try QCB~f,f,SS,N,F+2
or QCB~b,b,SS,N,F+2. In fact the buffer time is so huge that you can
attempt 2 backdashes and 2 SS's (thanks Catlord)!! Hence, it is notated
as QCB~b,b,SS,b,b,SS,F+2. Note that you cannot at a neutral to the
motion when you attempt to do 2 SS and 2 backdash (neither can you if
you do 2 backdash and 1 SS) This really adds a huge dimension into
Julia's Mad Axes game since you can pull the MA out of almost no where.
Imagine, your opponent sees you dashing in with f,f and expects an
elbow but instead you give him Mad Axes in return. All the combinations
is limitless and when you add backdash/ dash before the MA's it really
makes you wonder why there are still retarded posts in TZ questioning
this as THE #1 throw in TTT.
Also another tip from Catlord is that you can add a TAUNT (2+3+4) in
between the motions of MA. Hence, QCB, 2+3+4, f,f+2.

You certainly didn't know all this, did you? Well neither did I :)

3+4
---
Ah yes very good litle trick here you can buffer mad axes into the spin
very easiy and you can use the buffer to keep a continuous spin going.
As before this requires you to use the F method. so the method would
be, 3+4,QCB,F then at this point you can continue the spin or
altenately use mad axes so from this you can use mad axes at any time
from the spin. Also you could use the B method using QCB and holding B.
And you have a huge range of mixups from the spin once you get the
cancel down so throw out some elbows and d,d/f+1 out of it as well to
keep them honest.

Fake low parry
--------------
This one one of a huge range of mixups you have from the fake low parry
FC,d/b,d,d/b+1+2 is better from the fake low parry as already covered
in the fake low parry section but mad axes from the fake low parry is a
nightmare considering the mixup potential.

Chickens
--------
I mentioned this in the 1~1,1 part of the move analasis it's very
cheeky and damaging. Sadly there aren't any chicken glitch back throws
in TTT where you just had to buffer mad axes and get a free
chicken+backthrow but this is still very good. I haven't actualy seen
any frame data for chickens but it doesn't change the fact that this is
an excellent buffer and very unexpected usualy unless you use it every
time.

Escaped throws
--------------
You think mad axes bufered in to a chicken is cheeky what do you do
here? This is well served by the excellent range mad axes has I'm not
sure about the frame data once again but unless your up against King
(Because of his GS and GunJack and Jack-2's d/b,f+1+2 the reach works
well for them as well) you will be able to throw them out of whatever
they do. Don't abuse this tough as it can get a bit predictable.


********
Okizeme:
********
Okizeme is a japanese term which roughly translated means hitting your
opponent while he is down and keeping him down. Julia has a very very
Mean okizeme game which rivals that of the Williams.  In fact Julia's
Okizeme game beats that of her mothers thanks in no part to several of
her exclusive moves. Here are all the possible Okizeme attacks listed
here.

d+1
d+2
d+3
db+3
d+4,4_d+4_1
(4),4,4_d+4_1
b+3
df+4,2,b,f+1
FC,df+4,3 (and any move with bow arrow like df+1,4,3)
f,f+1,4
df+1,1
f+1
uf+3+4
d,df+1,2_f,f,f+1,2
b+4
f+1~2
f+1+2
UF,N+3
f+1+4

....well there could be more.

Anyways here is a quick review of how to use the okizeme moves. Again
they can be divided into a few categories.

Group #1 Rolling Backwards/Forward Opponents
Group #2 Laying still opponents
Group #3 Rolling to the side opponents
Group #4 Getting up with an attack
Group #5 Tech rolling opponents

Group #1 Rolling Backwards/Forward Opponents
--------------------------------------------
If this happens, Julia has landed herself OKIZEME jackpot. Of course
you won't see good players rolling backwards/ forwards without reason
especially without reason. In fact backrolling in the heat of the
battle is a tell tale sign that your opponent is a scrub or at least
has a bad habit which you are going to cure. A lot of Julia's moves
work well here.

Moves like d+1 and d+2 will catch an opponent in their early frames of
backrolling and float them up. If your opponent floats, he gets a free
FC,df+4,3, df+4,2,b,f+1 juggle. d+1 and d+2 recover well which means
you are at a minimal risk when going for loads of damage. You can also
omit d+1 and just do FC,df+4,3 Mountain crusher too.

Like wise with f,f+1 (her party crasher). If this catches your opponent
tech rolling, he is floated and you can continue with two more elbows
before rounding off with d,df+1,2. f,f+1 is exellent because its
recovery is very good.

df+4 can also be used much like f,f+1. df+4 has good range and if it
catches a back rolling opponent you can finish off with df+4,2,b,f+1
for good solid damage.

The WR version of d,df+1,2 works in the same way too. It gives Julia
Okizeme power even from far away. Julia can run in from 2 characters
distance away and catch your opponent on the later frames of rolling
backwards. d,df+1 will float which gives you a free 2. Solid damage
again.

d+4,4_d+4_1. Use this only sparringly. You have to hit your opponent
quite early in the roll (assuming you are near them) since d+4 has
pitiful range. You must really be expecting your opponent to roll
backwards. You can't d+4 on reaction, because it is rather slow and
will wiff most of the time. If your opponent chooses to lay still, d+4
will push your opponent too far away for the follow ups to connect.
4,4,x can be used much in the same way though I find it faster and thus
slightly better.

Other moves would be df+1,1, f+1, f+1~2, f+1+4... the possibilities are
ENDLESS (well not quite but there are loads of them).


Group #2 Laying still opponents
-------------------------------
After some serious pounding time and time again from attempting to roll
away, your opponent finally decides that it is time he stays on the
ground. Safe? Not really. Julia still has a lot of moves to throw to
punish a opponent lying on the ground

d+3, db+3 and d+4 work much in the same way to hit grounded opponents.
They don't do to much damage, but they are very safe. db+3 has more
range than d+3 though the drawback is that it sometimes WIFFS your
opponent. So unless you are craving for that extra lenght, stick to d+
3. d+4 is slower and I wouldn't recommend players using it especially
with its equally short range like d+3. Stick to d+3.

b+3 is used almost in the same way as d+3. I'd like to stress ALMOST
because although b+3 is a low move, it sacrifices speed for the
additional length. The extra speed would be enough for alert opponents
to counterattack you though if you KNOW your spacing you could EASILY
get a CH and punish them in return. Also because of the extra length,
you could use b+3 at a safer distant away in case you require to tag
out after that. FC,df+4 can also be used similarly though you don't get
anything from a CH. FC,df+4 will push the opponent away so do not
follow up with the arrow kick (3).

The earthquake stomp, uf+3+4 should ONLY be used very sparringly. The
damage dealt by it is great, but due to the poor tracking, Julia's poor
judgement and relatively slow iniatition  as mentioned when discussing
uf+3+4.

f+1+4 can be used against BIG characters ONLY. 50 points of damage
isn't so bad after all especially if they refuse to wake up. Other mid
hitting attacks are also possible against fatties. Among them are f,f+
1, f+1~2, f+1, WS+4, WS+2,x etc.

This is also a good opportunity to 3SS or jump over your opponent to
set up OB trap. Even if your opponent rises before you get to his back,
you have positional advantage over them.


Group #3 Rolling to the side opponents
--------------------------------------
Rolling to the sides is prolly the best thing an opponent can do.
However Julia STILL is able to punish her opponent severely if he
choose to roll to the side.

d+1 and d+2 can be used again. You have to be very close to your
opponent and if they try rolling to the sides, d+1 and d+2 will float
them for a juggle.

4,4 is also pretty useful to catch opponents rolling to the side in the
early frames. This is because 4,4 is quick and has pretty good
tracking. I'm not so sure with d+4 but I stay far away from it since it
is slower in which case its hard to catch opponents in the earlier
frames.

db+3 can be useful since the sweep is a wide one and so it will be able
to hit opponents in their early to mid frames of rolling to the side.


Group #4 Getting up with an attack
----------------------------------
Some players JUST have the bad habit of "Must get up with an attack".
The attack gives them the illusion that they are safer. How wrong they
are. What they do not know is that they can easily be CH'ed for a huge
as juggle. Usually when punshing a player getting up with an attack, he
has to guess or at least predict whether what he is going to do. With
Julia however, she has some execellent moves with LONG reach that
prevent her from getting into danger zone.

d+1 is commonly used (more in OB trap though) to snuff out an opponents
attack. d+1 will beat out almost anything of your opponent except the
low shin kick, and possibly the hand spring (if timed right)

b+3 This is where the range of b+3 comes into play. Since it has very
good range, Julia is safe from anything your opponent tries. Plus you
are in the running to nail them in the act on CH and punish them big
time.

b+4 works much in the same way but is way more riskier. Since it will
only CH certain attacks like the rising kick for example. Try to SS
before attempting b+4. Risky.

f+1+2 is used when your opponent tries to spring up to his knees
immediately (don't know how to explain it) much like you would with
Jin's b+4. Hopefully it will CH to send your opponent flying for a
juggle. It can be used from afar so its safe.

d,df+1,2 can be used to counter hit your opponent if you suspect he is
getting up with an attack. Best to use the WR version to attack an
opponent from a distance. There are other better options if you wish to
use d,df+1,2 in close.


Group #5 Tech rolling opponents
-------------------------------
Tech rolling opponents  are the most difficult IMO to punish, mainly
because most of the time when they tech it is because of an error in a
combo or a powermove. There is no surefire way of punishing tech
rolling opponents and most of the time you will have to rely on mixups
when he recovers.

df+1,1 as mentioned earlier can be used to trick opponents into
techrolling during a elbow juggle. Should your opponent tech roll, df+1
will wiff but 1 (the flash uppercut) will connect.

d+4,4 is okay too in catching tech rolling opponents though you have to
start doing d+4,4 early. Thanks to Priz for telling me this.

A trick I like to do when In close is to SS in the opposite direction
that your opponent techs and immediately grab him. If you time it
right, you will get a Back throw. You can also SS to his back and 4,4,1
juggle him.

Other suggestions (from Night) would be to mix up Mad Axes and df+2,1
to punish opponents when they finish tech rolling.

*******
OB TRAP
*******

OB trap? Whats that?
--------------------
OB trap is a term when you force your opponent's back to face you.
Usually in a game of tekken, your opponent's back will seldom face your
back unless he has a move to get into BK position (Lei's, Ling's,
King's etc) However since your opponent is extremely vulnerable when he
is backturned (note: Can't block anything)  it is the best position you
could have hoped for. So how can I backturn them if that is so? This
invovles a bit of trickery. Basically, you want to interrupt your
opponent in a frame where they turn their back towards you to attack
and backturn them ready to capitalize on their mistake, hence the term
"OB trap".

Setting Up OB trap
------------------
You must first make sure that your opponent is in PLD position. PLD or
"Play Dead" position when your opponent lies on the ground, facing up,
head towards you, feet away. You can get your opponent to PLD position
via a few methods. They are Mentioned and discussed as below.

* Direct Method
This involves moves which will put your opponent in PLD position
immediately. Moves that fall under this category would be her 1+3 and

2+4 throw. Also on CH, b+3 will place your opponent in PLD position.

* Indirect Method
This involves moves which will put your opponent in PLD position from
KND (ie Opponent is Face up, face away, feet towards). The first method
would be jumping over your opponent. Another method is triple sidestep
to the back of your opponent. Yet another way is using an uf+3+4 which
will jump over your opponent though this is NOT a very good or useful
method.

* Automatic Method
Like Yoshi, Julia can Backturn her opponent automatically too. However
unlike Yoshi, because she is at a frame disadvantage, NOTHING is
guranteed. The move I'm referring to is of course Julia's b+2 (or 2~b).

And the Bait?
-------------
Now that you have gotten your opponent to PLD position its time to bait
your opponent so that he thinks you have messed up and tries to rise
with an attack. Moves that fall into this category are quick moves with
good recovery. Among some of them are:-

f,f+1 (prolly the MOST popular and common choice)
df+4 (another popular choice)
Quick standing pokes like 1, 2 and 4
WS+1 (best One I suppose from WS position)
b+4 etc.

What now?
---------
Should your opponent try to wake up and attack, d+1 or df+4 immediately
I like d+1 more than df+4 but df+4 has good range which your opponent
may undersestimate. Also df+4 puts Julia in STANDING position which is
more useful. Hopefully if you do it correctly your opponent's back will
be facing you ready to eat some painful follow ups. Julia's Follow ups
after OB trap are AMONG the best in the game, next to Jin. Among some
of the follow ups that I bother to use are WS+2,1,1 and WS+2,2 in FC
position and df+4,2,b,f+1 and 4,4,1 to juggle in Standing position.


Confused?!? Okay I will give you a few example of how it works.

OB Trap Situation #1
--------------------
Julia grabs her opponent with 1+3 throw. Her opponent's head is facing
towards Julia, faced up. Julia rushes in with an elbow hoping to catch
her opponent rolling and juggle him. Her opponent was wise to stay on
the ground (since the worst that could happen is he eats a free d+3
which is guranteed anyways) but on seeing that Julia's f,f+1 had wiffed
him, he tries to rise up with an attack. Julia IMMEDIATELY does d+1
after f,f+1 had whiffed, to interrupt her opponents rising kick and her
opponent is backturned. She finishes him off with WS+2,1,1 for some
solid damage.

OB Trap Situation #2
--------------------
After knocking down her opponent with a move, her opponent choose to
lie on the ground. Julia jumps over her opponent. Seeing that Julia
jumped over him, his opponent thinks that Julia has messed up and
immediately rises with an attack. Upon landing, Julia immediately d+1
which will also turn her around and interrupt her opponent's attack. In
FC position, Julia chooses to punish her opponent with WS+2,2.

OB Trap Situation #3
--------------------
Julia managed to grab her opponent with her FC,db,d,db+1+2 throw which
leaves her opponents side towards her. Instead of sweeping her opponent
she instead Sidesteps towards her opponents head (so that her opponent
will now be in PLD position) Now she tries a standing 1 which of course
whiffs her opponent. Seeing the standing 1 whiffs, her opponent tries
to rise with an attack, in which Julia immediately interrupts with
df+4. Now Julia has a choice, she can either finish off with a mountain
crusher or attempt a 4,4,1 and juggle. The mountain crusher is
guranteed but 4,4,1 has a chance of whiffing due to spacing.


These are but just some examples of OB traps. Try to be creative and
set up other OB traps of your own.


********
Movement
********

Movement is a key in any good players game. Most players just do a
move, stand there and block and attack again. Sure against beginners
and average players this will work out fine. However , if you are to
play it as a 2D game in a 3D world, I'm sure you are going to get a
serious trashing against good opponents. DO NOT ADOPT THE MENTALITY OF
"HIT, BLOCK, HIT". Think of this as a boxing match. You don't punch
your opponent and wait for him to react and punch you back right? Come
on, you have so many options available to you. Namco didn't just put
the Sidestep feature into the game for no reason, did they? Just look
at any of the top player's and you will see that they are constantly on
the move, whether it is sidestepping, dashing, backdashing, poking etc.
They are alwasy doing something. By moving around a lot, your opponents
chances of hitting you and landing that major butt-kicking juggle
starter is lower. Moreover, he may wiff and therefore allow you the
chance to counter attack him. There are occasions when blocking will be
more of a disadvantage to you than sidestepping. The best example is
Bryan's b+1~5 which causes such a long guardstun that he is guranteed
at least a 1,2 or 1~4. In such a case, blocking would be very much
hazardous than sidestepping. If you managed to sucessfully sidestep his
b+1 and end up at his back you get a free 4,4,1 and juggle. By
stressing the importance of sidestepping I do not mean just
sidestepping for the sake of sidestepping, because if you do your
opponent can punish you easily. A DEWGF is a reason enough.

Sidestepping
------------
Julia does not have a wide sidestep as compared to the Mishimas or Team
Korea. However, that does not mean her sidestep is not as important.
She makes up for it with her extremely useful 3+4 spin which, when used
in conjunction with SSR enables her to do a double and triple sidestep.

Her double sidestep can be notated as
SSR, 3+4
or
3+4, SSR
SSR, 3+4 is the one most commonly used since SSR has a wider SS
movement than 3+4. Using 3+4 enables her to chain immediately into her
4,4,1  should she be able to get behind her opponent. You can also use
this on a downed opponent to circle strafe them.

Her triple sidestep is notated as
SSR, 3+4, SSR
Her triple SS is not as useful as that of Team korea. It is usually
limited to circle strafing a downed opponent. Best used when you down
an opponent after a KND move like f,f+1 elbow for example since you
will be off axis and hold the advantage.

Those are her basic sidesteps. You should now incoporate other
movements into her sidestep such as dash or backdash, even cancel her
sidestep into another sidestep.
This is a basic one,
f,f,N, SSR,3+4, b,b,N, SSL,

And here is a more complicated one
SSR~f, SSR, 3+4, f,f,N, SSR, 3+4, SSR

If you get unpredictable with your sidesteps you create enough
confusion with your opponent that he is afraid to commit himself to an
attack. Just look at Shafi's Changs. They have awesome SS movement
indeed.
Once you have your sidestep movement down, then its time you add
attacks into your sidestep. Although Julia does not have any Sidestep
moves to come out from Unlike Michelle except for her pathetic SS+2,
she can cancel her SS anytime with moves like 1~1,1, 4,4,1, f+1+2 etc.
This will be discussed further when I go to positioning.

To succesfully sidestep opponent's moves, sidestep in the direction the
move of which he is pulling off. For instance if he is pulling off a
right punch, you would sidestep to your right (your opponents left) Of
course this is just a general formula. Somemoves track well and some
don't. Take Jin for example. EWGF doesn't track well while f,f+2
Demon's Paw has good tracking. EWGF can be sidestepped in both
directions rather easily, but sidestepping to the left (your opponents
right) of f,f+2 is a tad risky because of its tracking. Not to say that
it is not impossible though, with perfect timing, you can sidestep
Jin's f,f+2 to both sides, a technique which RedKing mentions in his
Jin Compendium as interrupted sidestepping. Even if you aren't
interested in playing Jin, do read his FAQ because his sidestep section
is useful for all characters, not only Jin alone.
Succesfully sidestepping an opponent's attack is more of an art which
you will slowly master. Do not give up when, at first you often get hit
even when trying to side step your opponent's move. Another thing to
remember is that some moves have really good tracking and it will hit
you unless you sidestep at the very last second. Other moves have
good radius (example Yoshi's standing 4) and will hit you if you
sidestep too early.


***********
Positioning
***********

Movement of course will lead to positioning. I find it sad that a lot
of players nowadays do not understand positioning. Julia  has great
movement in her game with her double/ triple sidestep game. With that,
she can strafe around her opponent much like what is possible in a game
of Quake. As such you will get to a few common positions. They can be
divided into a few groups: In Close, Dash range, Far, Side, Back

In Close
--------
Well this is the area Julia will be most of the time because she will
be all over her opponent pounding them with poke after poke. Basically
you want quick attacks like standing 1 and stay far far away from slow
attacks like f+1+2 and b+3. b+4 is also an ideal attack to use assuming
your opponent is trying to fight out of this position with pokes of his
own.

Dash Range
----------
Inevitably after pounding your opponent for some time, there is going
to be some space left between you and your opponent. I feel that the
Dash range game for Julia is the most important part of all since it
decides whether you can keep your opponent at bay or get pounded to a
pulp yourself. This may not be Julia's strongest part of the game since
she does not have a CD move or Yoshi's WGF like df+2. In such an
instance, moves like df+4, standing 4 should be very common to play a
keep away game. Her elbows and d,df+1 is going to be used a lot to
close the distance on your opponent. If you are aiming to punish an
opponent, badly then f+1+2 and even b+3 should be used in hope for a
CH.

Far
---
Nothing much really..... run up to your opponent... maybe use WR, 1,2.
You could go for the cross chop or tag slide or best yet cut the run
half way, sidestep and then use moves like her f,f+1 and d,df+1 to get
in close to your opponent.

Side
----
If you are at your opponents side, which is very likely with her double
triple sidestep game, you can attempt f+1+2 or 1~1,1 in hope of a CH. I
noticed that a lot of good players use f+1+2 after a sidestep and I
found that it is excellent. I prefer f+1+2 over 1~1,1 since it has a
longer reach and as such has less chance of wiffing over the shorter
ranged 1~1,1. You could also attempt a side throw on your opponent
though if he is alert he would easily break out of it.

Backturned
----------
You will get into this position after sidestepping an opponents move
like the last hit of Jin's b,f+2,1,2 for example. You could also get
into this position as a result of an OB trap setup. If your opponent is
still recovering from an attack, Backthrow him. It looks cool and you
won't have to worry about missing a juggle. If not just try one of the
follow ups discussed in the OB trap section.


*************************
Poking and Custom Strings
*************************

Poking is an essential part in any characters game, be it a big
character who depends on power hits or a weak character who relies on
many hits. Even at intermediate level of play, you can't depend solely
on doing 10 power hits in a row to win your game, because unless your
opponent is retarded he not going to fall for it. As such poking your
opponent with weak but quick moves will open the opportunity for you to
counter your opponent with that power move or CH move that you have
been waiting for. Which leads us to strings.

I think Ben Cureton (Tragic) best defined what custom strings are in
his Yoshi FAQ and I quote,

" Custom string is a series of quick moves in which, when used
together, make it very difficult for your opponent to do much of
anything besides blocking. This isn't as easy as it sounds though,
because putting a few moves together one after another doesn't make an
effective custom string. You must create your custom strings to be
quick and very unreadable. Most custom strings are more useful than
real strings because of their speed and lack of major delay between
moves. Some people refer to custom strings as "patterns" but this is a
general misconception. Patterns can easily be spotted which in turn can
be easily defended against. A true custom string has many alternatives,
making it very hard to defend against and at the same time they often
force your opponent into making unwise decisions. "

This is NOT a section where I just give pre-canned cookie cutter custom
strings which you use over and over again. Generally, people would
agree that custom string sections in FAQs are useless and Indeed they
are. Some of the pre made custom strings may work against slower
characters but not against the other more pacey ones. Using the same
custom strings over and over again will get you into a lot of trouble
because in any setup there are undoubtedly loophooles which your
opponent can capitalize on.

However in this section, I strive to give you readers a better
understanding of stringing with Julia and how to understand frame
advantage. For beginners, do not be put off or afraid if you do not
understand frames. I will put a lot of the frames in layman's (or
gameplay) terms so that you can see what and what not to do.

Forward Momentum Moves:             Stationary moves:
f,f+1                               1_2
1,2                                 df+4
1~1                                 4
WS+2,1                              WS+1
d,df+1                              FC,df+4
4,4                                 d+1_d+2

Well the above is just some of the examples I can think of. Note there
are others but these are the basic and favourites which everyone uses.
Since the moves have already been discussed in detail in the move
analysis section, I will just get to her strings.


We start off with this, a basic string for Julia.

1, d+1, FC,df+4,3_FC,df+2_WS+1_WS+4_WS+2,x
Well nothing much too it. A standing Jab will give you 0 advantage when
blocked and 6 frames of advantage when hit so d+1 is extremely safe
after that (the worst that could happen is against another opponent
with 8 frame jab is you both get hit). Should your opponent try to hit
you after 1 d+1 will interrupt him and give you a few frames of
advantage. With the advantage, you can try Julia's WS mixups. Try to go
for quick ones initially, WS+1 for example since your opponent may try
to interrupt you with a d+1 of his own, before moving to slower ones
like FC,df+4,3 or WS+2,1,1 when he knows that attacking you after d+1
will get him hit instead. Should d+1 be blocked you are at a frame
advantage, so it is best to remain on the defensive blocking/
interrupting the moves he throws at you.



Got that? Now I will move on to her more popular elbow strings.

f,f+1, f,f+1, 4_1~1,1_1~2,1_Mad Axes or any throw
f,f+1, f,f+1<4
f,f+1, f+1
f,f+1, <block opponents d+1>, FC,db,d,DB+1+2
f,f+1, d+1, FC,db,d,DB+1+2
f,f+1, d+1, WS+1, f,f+1, d+1, WS+1... (infinitely)

When I say f,f+1 I am of course referring to the f,f,N+1 version of it
since that gives her less disadvantage should it be blocked. Her elbow
is used a lot in strings because it helps closes distance very well, is
extremely quick and also is mid hitting (meaning your you are able to
train your opponent to block high) Since Julia ducks slightly during
the elbow animation, she is quick save from high attacks. Okay quit
yapping and on to the meat of the string.
* You are basically using f,f+1 to close a small distance between you
  and your opponent say after blocking Kazuya's WGF for example. After
  blocking the f,f+1, your opponent will prolly try to retaliate with
  quick standing 8 frame pokes in hope of CH'ing you (knowing that you
  are in -2 disadvantage). In this case f+1 or even f,f+1 serve the
  purpose well. If you wish to hit your opponent with f+1 you need to
  be very sure that your opponent is going to poke high, other wise you
  will be doing a slow f+1 which your opponent will easily interrupt.
  If unsure, do not do ANYTHING.
* If he tries to d+1 you (an attack which will fluff out anything you
  try even another elbow) you can either get him with a delayed 4 (why
  why why would you sacrifice recovery of an elbow for delayed 4 I
  don't know) or just duck right after the elbow. Remember when I said
  after blocking the elbow you have the advantage? Now is your chance
  to capitalize on it with a FC,db,d,db+1+2 throw or any of Julia's
  FC/WS mixups.
* Should your opponent decide to turtle after blocking the elbow, you
  can either throw him with a generic throw, buffered Mad Axes or d+1
  setup into a throw. f,f+1 or df+2,1 works well if your opponent ducks
  in anticipation of your throw.
* Should your opponent try to CH you with anything slow (e.g. WGF,
  Deathfist) after an elbow hit 1~1,1 or 1~2,1 immediately to CH him
  for big damage. Congrats, you have just hit jackpot with Julia.
* Er and forget about the infinite string... that only works against
  scrubs and intermediate players. You can prolly use the string during
  the last 2 seconds of a match to waste some time.



Now that we have gotten strings which are in close and personal, I will
discuss briefly strings where there is a bit of distance between you
and your opponent. Its rather hard to give a full account of things
possible because the spacing can vary and there are millions of things
your opponent can do.

df+4, f,f+1, elbow strings
df+4, d,df+1<2_ d,df+1, Mad Axes
df+4, Mad Axes
df+4, b+3_b+4_f+1
df+4, df+1,1
4, f,f+1, elbow strings
4, 4, f+1+2 (note this is two high kicks not 4,4)

These are just some examples to show how spacing can make a difference
from in close. df+4 and 4 are works almost in the same as long ranged
pokes. However, their purpose is the same, as zoning attacks, but their
properties are of course different as discussed earlier.

* If you use df+4, the distance between your opponent is about 1
  characters away. df+4 will keep most bulldogs at bay, and will help
  snuff out a lot of Michelle's elbows. If df+4 is blocked, your
  opponent will be a safe distance away. Should he rush in with high
  pokes, you can attempt b+3 or b+4 in hopes of a CH or f+1 to duck his
  attacks and juggle him. Personally, I would go for b+4 since a lot of
  people underestimate this attack by Julia and it is going to catch a
  lot of people on CH by surprise.
* If your opponent decides to turtle you have an option here, do you
  apply more pressure on him or do you go for a throw? Mix them up
  especially a mad axes with a dash in between. Most of the time your
  opponent will not suspect that you are going to throw him with Mad
  Axes when you dash towards him but stand instead in anticipation of
  an elbow. As an alternative to her elbow you can always try d,df+1
  instead and the mixups ensuing it.
* 4 works in the same way as df+4 only that you have to realize it
  doesn't have as much range and as such your opponent will be nearer
  to you. I like to do a few 4's in a row especially if the first 4
  whiffs my opponent as they will usually carelessly charge into the
  subsequent 4 for CH. You know what to do after that right? Also f+1+2
  works well after 4 (and also df+4) since it will duck under high
  attacks and CH your opponent.


Now that you have at least a basic idea of effective strings, here is
what you should stay far far away from.

d,df+1,2, 1~1,1_d+1
1, d+1, d+3, FC,df+2
4,4, FC,df+4,3

* In the first example above, after d,df+1,2 you are already in a frame
  disadvantage. You should not do ANYTHING at all because anything you
  do will lead to your opponent getting you on CH. If your Opponent is
  fast enough, that would mean an EWGF juggle or at very least a free
  Shining Fists.
* In the second one, d+3 should not be used. You could try using 1 in a
  few matches, but the risk that you are taking is not worth the
  reward. d+3 is slow to initiate and has horrendous recovery when
  blocked. Moreover, even if it does hit (counter or clean), you are
  STILL at a frame disadvantage. Although this strings to a fair level
  against scrubs (since they will just eat the d+3 and then rush into
  the FC,df+2) even semi decent players will punish you badly if you
  try d+3.
* Finally the last example. 4,4 is pretty good at intermediate level to
  get to FC position, and then start her FC/WS mixups. However, 4,4 is
  too risky at higher level of play since the low kick will almost
  always get parried. Besides even if the low kick hits, you will be at
  a frame disadvantage and your opponent can snuff out any attack of
  yours with a d+1.


In conclusion, I would once again want to reiterrate that the poking
and custom strings section should not be used wholesale but only to
give yourself an idea of what should and should not be used in a given
situation. Be creative, try new setups of your own because being
predictable will be your worst enemy.


********
Chickens
********

If you played DOA2 (or Tekken 2 for that matter) you will know how much
it is a blessing to Tekken players that you are able to reverse a
reversal (aka Chicken). This discourages turtling and also prevent you
from taking what would otherwise be unfair, unnecessary damage.
The general formula to chickening is to input f+1+3 for reversal which
invovles a left punch (1) or left kick (3). You can also guess that
f+2+4 are chickens for move that involve right punch (2) and right
kicks (4). However there may be some ambiguity over some moves which
require double button presses, like f+1+2 for example. In those cases,
their chickens are stated in the move analysis, if you haven't noticed
by now.
Unless you have good reflexes, or your opponent reverses every single
move, you will have to buffer chicken selectively. What I mean here is
you buffer moves which have the possibility of being reversed, and not
every single hit in a move. Take for example 1~1,1. Your opponent can
only reverse the first and last hi if 1~1,1 is blocked. Therefore, with
that knowledge, you should only buffer chicken for the first and last
hit. Buffering chicken for the 2nd hit is redundant. With all this in
mind, let us look at moves which are usually reversed.


1~1,1  (first and last hit)
4,4,4  (first and last hit)
4,4,1  (first and last hit)
df+1,1 (both hits)
1,2,4  (first and last hit)
df+4,2,b,f+1 (all hits)
d,df+1,2 (only first hit)
f,f+1,4 (last hit only)
uf+4 (er... well there is only one hit here)
df+2,1 (only the first)
df+2,4 (both hits)
f+1+2
f+1
WS+4
SS+2
f+1+4
etc.

If you already know how to buffer chicken then skip this section. It is
a waste of time. For those who still have no idea of how to buffer a
chicken then read on.
Lets take a basic example of f+1 shall we. First of course press f+1 to
initiate her flash uppercut. Usually you would just release f+1, but if
you want to buffer a chicken into it, don't. Instead keep holding f+1
and then press 3, hence f+1+3. Should your opponent reverse your f+1
Julia will immediately punch him back in the face before he can hurt
her and the announcer will shout "Chicken" If he doesn't the match will
just continue as normal.
Lets move on to a trickier move to chicken, say df+1. After performing
df+1, keep on holding 1. Now roll your joystick (or joypad) from df to
f and when you reach f, press 3.

Chicken baiting
---------------
Some opponents (especially scrubs) just can't help but reverse all day.
You might want to teach them a lesson. This usually involves using
slow, easily chickened moves to make them see how wrong they are that
reversals are king. This is known as chicken baiting. Among the moves
are 1~1,1 (last hit), f+1+2, f+1+4 and SS+2. Do note that if your
opponent wisens up and blocks instead of reversing you could be in
trouble at times like a blocked 1~1,1 for example. Also be aware that
in some cases, some reversals cannot be chickened. They are King's Kick
reversal and Wang's left punch reversal. Any parries (normal or punch
parries) cannot be chickened as well.


Chickening is a vital technique for any player who aspires to be good
in Tekken. If you want to improve your gameplay you have to be able to
buffer chicken into your attacks fluently, while not affecting your
normal gameplay.


***************************
Throwing and Throw Escaping
***************************

Throwing
--------
Duh! Like you need advice on throwing. Just abuse her mad axes. Do not
however use familiar set ups time and time again. f,f+1, Mad axes will
only work 2 or 3 times before your opponent catches on and breaks the
throw on anticipation. Breaking Julia's Mad Axes on reaction is
extremely hard to say the least and even the best players rely on
anticipation rather than reaction to break the throw. Also you should
mix up your throws (double Duh!) Maybe try f,f+1, Mad Axes and the next
time f,f+1, 1+3 instead. Mixing up throws is a battle of psychology of
you and your opponent. I think this section should explain itself
enough and I need not go further into telling you how to throw.

Throw Escaping
--------------
Throw escaping is a completely different matter though. I find that
average players do NOT escape throws enough. Therefore, they deem
throws cheap, when in fact you have a large window of escape for most
throws (bar throws like Mad Axes) Basically,escaping throws is easy if
you know which throw he is going to do and when. In theory it is easier
said than done, but here are some pointers.

1) Watch your opponents hands. If the Left hand extends longer than
   his right, then he is going for a throw with a 1 break. If his
   right hand is longer than his left, then the break for the throw
   is throw. If both hands extend equally, the break is 1+2. Of course
   there are some exceptions but this is the general rule.

2) With most throws, the escape frame is almost one full second. Watch
   for the purple flash whenever a person grabs you. Most opponents
   have a tendency to go for certain throws so it would be wise to
   know before hand which throw he likes to go for.

3) When being thrown, and unsure, just press something (1,2 or 1+2)
   Pressing any of the combinations is better than not doing anything
   because you will have a 33.3% chance of breaking the throw.

4) Look at your opponents hands if possible. This does not apply only
   to Multithrows only. Looking at your opponent hands while playing
   not only tells you what throw he is going to do, but generally
   gives away what he is going to do next.

5) Becareful when looking at your opponent's hands when he does Multis.
   Some Multi windows are pretty large and your opponent has loads of
   time to fake the throw.

6) Although some people suggest the theory of 1~2(hold 2)~1 or 2~1(hold
   1)~2 this theory has not been proven. I think that the escape of the
   throw depends on the frame of input of the escape. In other words,
   the technique suggested by some people worked because it was
   coincidence that they hit the correct escape button at the frame of
   escape.

Remember, everytime you escape a throw, you are avoiding 30+ damage and
the follow up damage from Okizeme. When you think about it, thats
almost the same damage from a CH 4, f,f+1 x3, d,df+1,2 juggle. Learning
to escape throws on reaction, not anticipation, will tremendously
improve your game. If you need practise on throw escaping, I suggest
that you turn your PS2 to Ultra Hard (Ultra cheese) mode and practise
escaping throwing there since the computer does nothing but block and
throw.



********
Tagging
********
Tekken Tag wouldn't be half the game if it weren't for this element -
TAGGING! A lot of players do NOT understand the tagging system of
Tekken Tag Tournament. From what I observe when playing, many players
blindly tag out when they are low on health. Yes, I know that you have
to bring in a fresh new partner because your character can be easily
KO'ed but by foolishly tagging out, they leave the poor tagging in
character open to all kinds of dangers. Worst is if you carelessly tag
out, your tagging out character may be KO'ed in the process. Do this to
me and I will undoubtedly punish you with something nasty.
Think about this, your character is low on health but if you bring a
fresh new character in and say Julia hits you with a Heaven Cannon
Unblockable + Juggle, your partner could be even badly hurt than the
initial fighter that just tagged out. Morever, your opponent is given
the initiative to pound you into oblivion with all kinds of Okizeme
attacks.

As a rule of thumb you should only tag out when
1) Your opponent is on the ground or your opponent is far away and not
   is not able to hit you.
2) You use a tag throw or do a tag combo. 2+5 is a very safe tag throw
   but the damage depends on Julia's partner (ie Bruce = very lil,
   Michelle = qutie a lot) Stay clear of Julia's special tag to
   Michelle. Its USELESS.
3) The worst time to tag out is when your opponent is charging up an
   unblockable or heavy hitting move. More likely than not, your
   partner will come rushing in only to be hit by the said move.
4) If your opponent is all over you and you need to tag out, try to
   knock him down or at least push him away so before making a tag. For
   this reason, Julia's elbow is ideal.
5) When you do tag, try to come in with a cross chop or tag slide (or
   its equivalent), at least once in a while, so that your opponent
   will not get into a habit of always trying to counter you when you
   tag out. Tag slides are useful not only because they can catch your
   opponent unaware but can be used to tag in an extra bit of damage
   at the end of a juggle. Also tag slides may be an excellent counter
   to certain moves (say Yoshi's b,b+1~1) At certain distance, tag in
   cross chop is almost unavoidable.
6) Tag frequently when given the chance to tag out. The small health
   regained may be the difference at the end of the bout. Also, do not
   get predictable with your tagging. A wrong tag will probably result
   in a nice WGF up your shiny noses.
7) If tag slides or cross chops are not your thing, you can always
   cancel the run in by inputting u~ub. This will stop your character
   from running and you can block or input your attack. This technique
   is also useful for doing some of the class 1 launcher juggles where
   you need to position yourself. It is usually much wiser (and safer)
   to use use the tag cancel since you do not need to commit to and
   attack and thus do not lose any initiative.
8) Julia can also tag cancel with her various moves like her taunt and
   command low parry. Like everyone she can cancel her tag in with d+1.
   Don't be stupid however and d+1 all the time, especially when your
   opponent is up your nose because he will almost always CH you. I
   think you should know by now that Julia's CH 1~2,1 is not very nice.

With all said, I also find that a lot of Tekken Tag players do NOT use
tag juggles enough. Come on, the damage lost during tag juggles cannot
be recovered. I can't remember how many close battles I won because of
the 'extra' health I could regain from tagging out. Julia may be a very
good juggler, but I'd sacrifice that extra health for the unrecoverable
health.

*********************
Parry or Not to Parry
*********************

Okay, so you are probably pyschic enough to know that your opponents
next move would be a db+4 by Lei. Question what do you do, what do you
do? With the introduction of Universal Parries as well as the Sweep
Stagger system, there is more than one way to 'counter' Low attacks, so
to speak. With this in mind, players sometimes do not know when may be
the ideal time to parry or block. Both has its pros and cons. Btw when
I speak of parries, I am referring to the universal parry and not
command parries or punch parries.

Blocking
Usually, you want to be blocking SLOW RECOVERING LOW PUNCHES. Of course
there are exceptions. Julia does not have good launchers off her FC/WS
position other than of course her hop kick. Since her hopkick is 14
frames and recovers like ass, you will most of the time rely on
guaranteed damage like FC,df+4,3. A Parried low punch gives you only 9
frames of advantage where you only get a free jab in. It would be
better to block the  9th Hit in Pauls' 1,2,3,1,4,2,1,4,2,1 10 string
since there is a long delay in between and you can get him with CH WS+
2,1,1 or WS+2,1,4,3. However there are some exceptions like a blocked
Julia's b+3 which gives you -33 frames of advantage! You could easily
capitalize on this with a hopkick to wonder juggle.

Parry
The reason you'd wanna use the universal low parry (df) is because it
ALWAYS gives you the initiative no matter what. A parried low punch
would give you get 9 frames advantage and with a parried low kick you
will get 16 frames of advantage. Obviously, the 9 frames after a
parried low punch do not mean much especially since parrying will often
shift your opponent off the axis a bit, so technically after
readjusting yourself, your advantage is less than 9 frames. The parried
low kick will give you a bigger advantage, so much so that you can get
a free df+2,1 into juggle. Generally parry any of your opponents
attacks especially if its a kick. An Example would be Julia's 4,4. By
parrying her Low kick you get a free juggle. If you had blocked the low
kick not only would you gain nothing, but you now have to face her
mixups.

At the end of the day, a correct parry or block could mean defeat or
victory especially in a tight battle.

Character Specific Strategies (Vs Section)
******************************************

Alex/ Roger
Difficulty : Easy
Against Alex and roger watch out for d+1,N+2 which is an essential
King's poke. Both of them have really short arms so unless you let them
get very near you, even Giant Swing will wiff more than often. Remember
Giant Swing can be tech rolled for half. The trick is to hit the button
WHEN you land so timing is of the essence here. You will have to look
out for moves like the Wind up punch, f,N+1 or its variant  which
causes such a long guard stun that Animal Godfist (well its actually
TGF) is guranteed. When you see them wind up for their punch don't just
stand there and look... Hit him with anything... uf+4, CH 1~2,1, CH, 1~
1,1 heck even b+3. Also do look out for SS+4, the low sweep, which you
should have more than enough time to block on reaction. Blocking this
low sweep causes Alex/ Roger to be guard stunned so erm...just follow
up with her Bow and Arrow to MC. The last thing to look out for is the
tail sweep which has small range but comes out so deceptively even good
players may have trouble looking out for it. I don't have any tips
against the tail trip but no opponent would be crazy enough to abuse
this move too much since he is just asking to be CH'ed by Julia.

Angel/ Devil
Difficulty : Easy ~ Hard
It really depends what kinda Angel/ Devil player you are up against, a
WD master or a Laser master. Anyways there are some subtle differences
between both of them which I will mention for those who have no
knowledge whatsoever of Tekken. Angel is a bit shorter, has shorter
arms and netsus with other characters. Devil is taller (so his laser
will wiff against smaller opponents like Ling), has longer arms (so WGF
X3 is easier with him) and does not netsu with other characters.
Anyways the main tool of Angel/Devil is of course df+1,2 Twin pistons.
A lot of Angel/ Devil players abuse this move a lot. If your opponent
is a scrub and abuses df+1,2 the whole day, a well times CH 1~1,1 will
see to it that his bad habits are not repeated. Watch for good players
to WD and mix up with Hell sweeps and Twin Pistons (though this is not
as dangerous as against Kazuya) Be careful of his OB traps (I will
explain more in detail in the vs Jin section since Jin's Ob trap is the
one to be feared) Angel/ Devil also has a Class 1 launcher in his/ her
SS+2 the devil twister. This launches you so high and you come
spiralling down, head first, meaning you can't tech roll. This really
opens the door to some very very sick juggles like Heihachi's d+1+4
unblockable... OUCH! Fortunately this move is easily telegraphed and
has poor recovery time (time for df+2,1 juggle I see) Of course I won't
even bother mentioning WGF which is THE best juggle starter in the
entire history of Tekken.

Anna Williams
Difficulty : Annaquin-like ~ Medium
Against Anna it is a battle of Pokes... her uf+1<3 and d+1,N+4 being
the more feared ones along with df+1,2 and d+4,1. Well uf+1<3 is her
new addition to TTT and a great addition it is. For one if the bad
habit kick connects then Anna gets a free f+1+2. Anna players will look
to delay the bad habit Kick in hope that it gets you on CH (and thus
free juggle)Needless to say, do not try anything stupid ... not even 1~
1,1 when an Anna player does uf+1. Be prepared however with 1+2 in case
they try throwing you with uf+1+2 after uf+1. Most of the time though
the throw comes out of no where so tech roll it and immediately tag out
(if you don't tag out immediately then your opponent gets a GURANTEED
cross chop) d+1,N+4 much like King's d+1,N+2 will be used a lot to
interrupt your poke. Another new move is her QCF+1, the high elbow
which will juggle on CH only. However if it does juggle look out for
chunks of lifebar gone. I would be tempted to say " Duck the QCF+1 and
punish the wiff" but unfortunately good Anna players will delay the
QCF+1 until the very last minute and if they find that you have ducked
in anticipation of the elbow, then they will instead go for her flip
kick which also equals juggle potential.
Then, there is also her sidestep mix up in her SS+2 (low) and SS+1+2
(mid) Off SS+2 she also has a juggle waiting for you. Anyways do know
her multi breaks (which aren't that good in the first place) and also
remember to buffer CHICKEN!

Armor King
Difficulty : Medium ~ Hard
A.King is a tricky customer to deal with, that is because he has so
many tools he can use against you - pokes, throws and a good launcher.
A.King is a very well balanced character, even though he has been
weakened somewhat since Tekken 2. Among the pokes you have to look out
for is of course the classic King d+1,N+2, 1,2, 2,1 and df+1. A lot of
A. King players like to set up throws (Giant Swing and DDT especially)
using a string of those pokes with the concept of "hit them mid until
they can't afford to block) Be wary of Giant Swing since it has great
range. DDT is prolly his best double break throw but doesn't do that
much damage. The last throw you should fear is his Tombstone
piledriver. While you can't perform it ala Mad Axes like you can with
King this throw does a lot of damage and after that it gurantee's him
some free okizeme. You really have to be prepared to break this throw
because it can really mean a great come back for your opponenet. Do not
bother too much with his Multi throw though since it is easily ducked/
telegraphed. My suggestion would be to duck the initial multi throw and
give him a throw of your own (FC, db,d,DB+1+2).
Well so much for pokes, I haven't even talked about his juggle
launchers. In CD+2 A.King has one of the best juggle launchers (bar
EWGF of course) in the game. The Dark Upper as it is called (more like
WGF to me though) has funny properties that it flips your opponent over
(if he is normal sized or to the side of a fattie) so he can do juggles
which end up with a guranteed Okizeme attack.... something like CD+2,
1, CD+1, d+1+2 does shit loads. Fortunately the Dark Upper is a bit on
the slow side (well slower than the WGF that is) but has better range
due to A. King's giant arms and hits sM (can be blocked low or high)
The unfortunate thing though is A.King has a pretty good CD mix up game
with his Knee move... CD+4 which hits mid, so there shall be no
turtling for those of you who think you can just be safe staying
crouched. However I myself prefer CD cancel into hopkick. Hopkicks for
A.King is very VERY safe since with his big size, he can do u+4 and not
commit himself (most characters have to do uf+4 and if its blocked get
punished real bad) u+4 leaves A.King relatively safe though you can
punish it with an elbow (the damage is puny though) Last but not least
he has the lariat kinda move in CD+1 which will leave you back turned
on the ground. Your opponent gets free mounted punches after that or if
he is extremely cheesy do the infamous A.King cuffs trick. For the
uneducated, this is when A.King repeated performs the backmount and
cancels it (without doing the mounted punches) As such he can go on
till time runs out or you beat him up (most preferably) maintaining his
lead for a cheap ass victory. Namco though has kindly removed such
cheese from the PS2 TTT so you don't have to worry about this. Other
not so common mix ups is of course CD into f,f,N+2. On CH you are
stunned. A lot people say this is a useless move without any auto throw
but trust me, the auto throw of King sucks and instead A.King has to do
a harder throw (well timing sense) in the Tombstone. Big damage though
(actually I didn't find it that hard, got it the first time I tried)
Since his multi throws (again) are not in the same league, I won't
bother mentioning them here as his CD mix up.
And in his miscellaneous tools section, A.King has the db+4 low drop
kick which is very deceptive even good players fall for it as LONG as
you don't over abuse it. His unblockable (the jumping smash) is also
worth a mention. Do not (I repeat) DO NOT just run at the back of him
when he is air borne and wait near where he is about to land hoping for
a back throw. A.King will turn in mid air and nail you for being so
dumb. Besides there is a weird recovery animation in that he bends a
bit after he lands so, a back throw is really tricky. Your best bet
would be to side step around him and nail him with 4,4,1 and juggle.

Baek Do San
Difficulty : Easy
Baek Do San is another unpredictable character. He can either be really
hard to fight against or very easy. Baek players will usually go into
their flamingo stance and from there force you to guess whether it they
are going for the Cannonball throw (F+2~3 in flamingo), df+2 uppercut,
more punches or kicks, the kicks notably can stun on CH. So how does he
go into flamingo stance? Well there are a few popular ways like WS+
4,4,3~(F_B), SS, b+3, and of course 1,2,3~(F_B). I'd like to bring your
attention to WS+4,4,3_3~(f_b), Albatross, which has a lot of range in
it and Baek will use it a lot to play a keep away game against you. Do
not try to interrupt even with d+1 after WS+4,4 lest you get stunned by
the 3 kick. I find a lot of good players using WS+4,4 a LOT and most of
them usually do it from CD. If you managed to download those huge
Freebaek movies, you'd be able to see how he just practically ABUSES
WS+4,4. As such, you unfortunately will end up having to play a turtle
game at times so be prepared to break the cannonball throw with 1+2.
The throw does good damage puts some space in between you and him to
set up his keep away game. He can opt to tag out to Hwoarang after this
throw, for one of the coolest tag throws in the game. In this case,
Hwoarang will be next to you and gets to set up some okizeme attacks.
Moreover it can be very hard for Julia players to interrupt the
constant barrage of punches since Baek players can also go into
flamingo and into d+1. It would be easy for me to advice you to play a
bulldog game but lets not forget the good sidestep game Baek players
has with their double/ triple sidestep which allows them to get behind
their opponent with ease. I have warn Julia players here about
excessive elbows and punches because Baek is one of the characters with
a punch parry. His Punch parry, b+1+2 is IMO the BEST in the game (yes
better than Bryan's if you are wondering) because it executes rather
quick (11 frames), gives him 15 frames of advantage if he manages to
parry something (good enough for a df+2 elbow and juggle) and if he
wiffs leaves him vulnerable only for 11 frames. The best thing about
the parry though is that it can be cancelled into flamingo. Oh and one
last thing... don't ever think that Baek is vulnerable when he is in
flamingo because he CAN punch parry out of flamingo. Just a reminder,
Baek does have a class one launcher in the Wing blade (f,n,d,df+3)
which juggles higher than most class 1 launchers. Of course the move is
so slow that you have enough time to go take a break before
interrupting with d+1.

Bruce Irvine
Difficulty : Hard
Two words. Cheese Knees. This is what makes Bruce such a hard opponent
to fight against, scrubs or masters. 3,2,1 has so much length and
decent speed to it that you really have to watch your spacing. Any CH
on 3,2,1 will result in you flying in the air watching those oh so
lovely...... I mean boring Cheese knees tear away at half your life
bar. Also even if its not on CH, if the 2 (or 1) connects you will also
be popped up. Remember that Bruce can only end the string 3,2,1,4
unlike Bryan (who can vary it with 3,2,1,2) so always tap df+4 for a
split second as it won't hurt you. The spacing between you and your
opponent leaves it relatively safe for you to tap df in anticipation
for a low kick. If you manage to parry the low kick follow it with df+
2,1 plus Juggle of course. Unfortunately, staying close to Bruce would
only mean df+2 and df+1,2. df+1,2 in particular is used a lot since it
has good priority and will juggle on CH. Again on CH look for another
cheese.. well you get the idea. A Chang player CANNOT play a total
punch game against Bruce lest you will get Punch reversed (f,f+2 which
is also the mach breaker) For those people who always say that bruce
Punch reversal is too slow to be used in a higher level of play, well
either you aren't using it correctly or you are just too dumb. Watch
Hameko's bruce and its no surprise to see him land countless Mach Punch
reversals. Unless you like hearing the CRUNCH of your bones, you need
to vary your game a lot. Julia has a good Kick game you know (take that
annaquin!) Besides its not only the auto punch reversal that Bruce
could really hurt you with. He has the b+1 back hand which on CH will
stun you and he will juggle you with your favourite juggle finisher.
b,f+4 the Knee launcher is used quite a lot to catch tagging in
opponents. Though slow, this move really does quite a lot on its own
and coupled with you know what does shit loads. And what about his
hopkick? It comes out real fast, and best of all the damage after the
hopkick rivals well Julia (you know what combo right?) Bruce poking
game can really screw you up if you up too. The mix up of (1),2,4_d+4
will keep you guessing. From what I notice, Bruces' (and Bryans to some
extent) game is all about spacing getting your opponent outside range 0
and range 1 so that their long legs will beat the hell out of you. Do
NOT be hasty with your moves, SS+4 and more importantly CH 3,2,1 are
just a tap away. His Okizeme game is rather weak, fortunately for you.

Bryan Fury
Difficulty : Hard
Julia Bryan... ahhh such an evil team. Anyways Bryan is one of the best
all round fighters in terms of power. If you think that Julia's combo
are too easy for the damage they do well think again. Imagine a simple
combo like uf+4, d+2, F+4,3,4 well just EATS away at your life bar. And
lets not forget all those stun combos like WS+3 (CH), b+1, d+2, 1~4,
(3),3 and you will soon get the idea of what is up with Bryan. You just
can't afford to make a mistake against bryan just like against Julia,
Jin or Bruce since he will make you pay very very dearly.
Anyways Bryan has a very good CD or in his case rolldash mixup game.
Off his Roll dash he can perform his Knee (WS+3_QCF+3) Uppercut which
seems more like a class 1 launcher even if it is a class 2 launcher
(WS+1_QCF+1), gut punch into fisherman slam (WS+2,F_B+2 or QCF+2,F_B+2)
or every one's favourite throw C.O.M (chains of Misery) Be prepared to
break COM with 1+2. Also his new move b+1 can be tag buffered. If
blocked Bryan gets a huge frame advantage, long enough for him to get a
free 1~4 or 1,2 punch. If it hits, you will be sent bouncing on the
floor and cannot tech roll. Just think of the possible damage he could
do b+1~5 to P.Jack tag in Stomp. Not necessarily guranteed but... OUCH!
You can of course sidestep this move and punish him because this move
comes out a bit on the slow side. d+2, the gut uppercut, is another new
move of his and is used to set up a lot of things, namely C.O.M., his
WS moves, uf+4 or continue with his other pokes. Speaking of Pokes,
bryan has a very heavy arsenal of it in 1,2,1,2_3 , 3,2,1,4_2 mixups.
Occasionally he may use b+3 since it does have good reach but if he
continues the other part of the b+3 string (b+3,2,1) remember to duck
and punish him. As mentioned against Bruce it is vital that Julia does
not just rush into him like pitbulls always do and pepper him with
punches because he too has a punch reversal, and unlike Bruces, I feel
that His is more effective. Left punch reverses into Mach punch and
right punch reverses into the Vulcan Punch which gurantees f,f+4 snap
kick into df+3. He also has moves like the QCB+2 (backsway into
uppercut) which is good to punish people and 1+2 which has evasive
properties. Though Bryan lacks low attacks, he does have df+3, a low
sweep which JUGGLES. This move is highly telegraphed and can be blocked
easily as long as you keep half your mind on the game. Block or parry
it (doesn't matter really but I always like to parry it) and punish him
accordingly. Problem is good players like to move around and suddenly
come out with the sweep. Do remember that even when Bryan ducks so low,
he still CAN be hit by mid moves so df+2,1 or uf+4 is a good counter
tactic. And what bout his overhead kick, uf+4? This move really rocked
in Tekken 3 and though toned down a bit now in TTT (doesn't seem that
toned down to me since the damage is just way too high) it is still the
perfect move to catch people who like to do d+1 the whole day. Well all
these moves actually fail in comparison to Bryans power game. He just
oozes in power with moves like the snap kick f,f+4, elbows b+2,1,2_4,
f,f+3 and of course every scrubs favourite... the mach punch.  My
advice against Bryan is play a good Kick game with Julia if you want to
dominate.

Eddy Gordo/ Tiger Jackson
Difficulty : Easy ~ Medium
To be very honest with you readers, I have not played against an Eddy
master so I can't really talk about how to play against good Eddy
players. However I do have some general ideas on how an Eddy player
would go about playing a good Eddy. If you are facing a masher, just
ignore this section and abuse 4,4,1 and f+1+4 like crazy. Low parry to
df+2,1 will work like a charm. If however he knows anything decent
about TTT, then he will use launchers such as df+3+4 which leaves him
relatively safe. Also do be careful because good Eddy players are able
to to half the recovery time of some of their moves and if you are too
hasty you will be caught on CH. One example is after Eddy's Headbutt,
he can do another one almost immediately. Be aware of Eddy's command
throw (argh... can't even remember the command off hand) but it is the
one where he climbs on top of you and spins around before throwing you
much like the arm drag in Wrestling. This throw does quite a lot and is
double break so be ready with 1+2. Also another launcher for Eddy is
one where he falls to the ground and kicks you. Well just be careful
with Eddy because the last thing you want him to do is Sidestep around
you and get a whole lot free slippery kicks.

Forest Law
Difficulty : Hard
Law when played right can be a total headache. However half the Law
players out there are stupid flip kick scrubs. Anyways for players who
do nothing but flip kicks the whole round, punish the recovery
(assuming they recover low) with df+2,1 plus juggle. It is a bit
trickier with a Law player who knows his stuff. Law is IMO the best
turtler in the game since he can just sit there and parry everything
you throw at him. Above the normal parries, low and high, he also has a
punch parry. Although the follow ups after the punch parry has been
changed quite a bit in TTT, the fact that he has a punch parry can
really mess up a Changs game based solely on elbows. Law can and will
match you poke for poke since he has equal speed and priority as you
do. I also have to bring to your attention one of Forest Law's BEST
move in d+2,3. Darn.. d+2 has so much priority speed and on CH, the
flip kick is guranteed. Law players will look to interrupt you a lot
with d+2 so watch your frame advantage and if you are at a disadvantage
its best to back off for the mean time. His hopkick is pretty decent
too (comes out fast and has a good combo after it connects) and so too
is his df+2 uppercut. Prolly the intermediates favourite move with Law
would be his b+2,3,4 and b+1,2,1 mix up. Of course they are both so
easily seen and countered that it should not be a problem. for b+2,3,4
its best to parry the low kick (duh!) rather than block it. For b+1<2<
1, watch out for Law players to delay the hits to try and catch you on
CH. They may even stop half way and throw, sweep you or try another
poke so I feel that b+1<2<1 is a decent set up move for Law. The sweep
move that I mentioned is db+4 which is highly telegraphed so block it
(he gets guard stuned) and punish him. Law players like to use db+4 in
Okizeme too, but it only hits rolling opponent and can't reach low
enough to hit a grounded non moving player. His SS moves are a mixture.
The double kick move, is pretty decent because it has speed but the SS
gut punches into the power punch isn't that effective IMHO. Law has
very good movement. While intermediate players will prolly use
FC,df,d,DF to initiate the slide, more experienced players will use it
for mobility as well as to mix up the slide with a WS+2 (or WS flip
kick) My advice? d+1 and hope that it floats him (Bow arrow kick into
MC) If he ever uses the Poison arrow f+1~2 and manages to hit it on CH,
you can (and should) tag out. However if Law is teamed with Paul, I
think that Paul can delay the run in 2,2 (actually his FC,df+2,2) and
still snag you but always try to escape the stun. Throw wise Law comes
up a bit short, his command throw f,f+3+4 (the knee to the gut) is a
double break throw and he also has a move where he uses your body as
stairs before splashing on you. This throw is escaped uniquely with df.
A battle between Law and Julia will be a close one since it is going to
be poke vs poke, hopkick vs hopkick, and juggle vs juggle....
fortunately he doesn't have Mad Asses. :P

Ganryu
Difficulty : Medium
In most cases, a big character would be a very easy kill for Julia
because of her sheer speed which just pounds slower characters to the
ground. Not Ganny though because he has the right tools (and advantage)
to beat Julia. However, Ganny is sort of the special Big characters
since he does not float with some juggle starters (like 1~1,1) much
like the other fatties YET you cannot do those long insane juggles that
you could do on like the other fatties. First off, as everyone may or
may not know, if Julia tries 3~2,1,4,3 or 1~1,4,3 the low kick in the
bow and arrow with wiff and thus leave Julia begging to be punished.
Sure not many will be using this face to face with any decent player
but imagine if you got your opponent back turned, and tried WS+2,1,4,3
only to see it wiff. Argh! Ganny also has a punch parry which again
will screw up a Changs game if she depends alot on elbows and 1~1,1's.
His punch parry is a weird one in that he will hop to your back (for
someone that fat its AMAZING) and give you either a back push or a not
guranteed back throw. However after chatting with ChinkyEye, he has
convinced me that Ganny depends too much on his WS+1+2, 1+2 and df+2+3.
Be very afraid of the guard stun if the second hit of WS+1+2,1+2 hits
since it gives him a whopping +23 frames advantage ... can you say free
throw/ juggle? I find that my opponents like to delay the second hit.
The guard stun opens up a huge mix up game for him. If you watched the
Jurio Cup matches where Mr. Wizard played, you will see why since wiz
practically went crazy on this one move. Also his df+2+3 the low
juggling punch is rather dangerous. It comes out rather deceptively and
is hard to see. If it connects your opponent can get a free juggle in.
Something from a simple uf+3+4 to df+2 juggles. And when it comes to
decent low pokes, he has one in the stature kick like df+3. Great for
okizeme as well as chipping away the life bar. Among his pokes, he has
the classic Sumo punches in 2,1,2,1 etc which is dangerous. On CH, the
2nd punch will give him a +12 frame advantage so that he can get in a
free throw or set up his other attacks. Also one of his new moves, df+
2, is a great poke and juggle starter since it has evasive properties.
Fortunately the juggles off the df+2 are rather tricky and don't do
much damage. His other moves are basically Jack moves like the jump in
sitdown (great for opponents who refuse to get up), sumo stomp (used
solely in combos Im afraid) f+1+2 the clap in as well as numerous
others. To top things up Ganny has a class 1 launcher which players
will use prolly to catch you tagging in more than anything. I evn
forgot to give mention to his wicked unblockable. Ganny ducks down real
low that high attacks and some mid attacks will wiff. More importantly
the unblockable comes out very fast, CAN be cancelled into an uppercut
and more frighteningly does a LOT of damage. Either poke him out of it
d+1, d+2, whatever, or sidestep the unblockable. Played right, Ganny is
a force to be feared.

Gun Jack
Difficulty : Easy
Although I have not played Gun Jack extensively (I personally like
P.Jack and Jack 2 more) Gun Jack can be dangerous in the right hands
even if he is at a severe speed disadvantage. If you are constantly
poking away with 1 and 4 you have to be very very ready to interrupt
his d+1+2 Bravo Knuckle. Although this move is very slow to say the
least, it ducks under high attacks and launches you very very high. If
Bryan is teamed with Gun Jack, then he gets a fisherman slam into
juggle.... can you say *ouCH* ? Also to watch out for is his uppercuts
which will cut through most of your standing pokes. On CH he can juggle
you and anything that Gun Jack deals is needless to say very very
damaging. But for pure CH damage, his 1,1,1 does shitloads and gives
him the spacing he needs to set up his other attacks. Remember though
that unlike most characters, his 1 is not his normal poke. Instead
Gunjack will poke with 2,(1) and occasionally when you get into the
habit of rushing in throw in the another 2 (making it 2,1,2). Also used
for poking is his df+3 which though slow is good for spacing reasons.
Again remember he is a Jack so anything that hits is bound to be high
damage. His Machine gun Knuckle (FC,db+2,2,2....) is an above average
poke (although I feel Jack2's version is much better) which is very
good to punish people who always duck low. Oh and before I forget, Gun
Jack has tons of throws which has very very good range (rivals King I
should add) which does tones of damage. You will prolly see the
Punishment drop the most (uf+1+2, d,df+2) If you fail the break the
initial throw you have the opportunity to block the follow up punch
(assuming he follows up with the punch) But with 1 frame to tap f to
block the punch, and if you fail it would count as CH, I suggest that
you very much take the damage. Other throws worth noting is his
Tombstone Piledriver (db,f+1+2) which is his most damaging throw of all
and gurantees him some okizeme and of course his modified catapult
which is a good juggle setup. His unblockables are nothing to sneeze
about too... well his wind up punch at least. Good players will use
this move occasionally only they will prolly make only one wind up
before punching you. The Wind up punch will be used often as to catch
tagging in opponents or attack immediately when you wake up. His low
sweep punch to deathfist (well looks like a deathfist to me) is used
occasionally. His trip punch (df+2+3) much like Ganny is another move
you should look out for a lot since it comes out deceptively (but slow
enough for you to block on reaction) and worst gives him good
opportunity for a juggle. Personally against the Gunjack, Julia should
play a very aggresive elbow/punch game and not let up any space for him
to set up his slower moves.

Heihachi Mishima
Difficulty : Hard ~ Very Hard
Erm... he is hard cuz he is a Mishima, `nuff said. Actually need I go
on about how his EWGF cuts through a lot of Julias move like a hot
knife through butter. Need I tell you that his df+1,2 twin piswon will
punish any blocked 1~1,1 , 1~2 even though there is a lag. Need I tell
you about his Wavedash into WS+2. Need I even explain why his Hell
sweeps are to be feared? *sIGhz* Heihachi is really REALLY tough
opponent to say the least. For the uneducated first off we have his
1,1,2 shining fist. Although the jab is 10 frames, and slower than
yours, it is very useful because should the 2 jabs hit the last punch
is guranteed. Not to mention that the last punch is delayable very
much. Of course if your opponent is a 1,1 scrub CH him with 1~2,1 and
teach him a good lesson. Good thing Heihachi's stamina is poor so 1~2,1
will prolly cut off around 65% of his life. Heihachi's EWGF is IMO the
best because it hits sM (so it cannot be crouched like Jins) and when
blocked gives him such a huge frame advantage he can prolly set up the
next attack. Besides you are knocked far away that you cannot punish
him (unlike Kazuya's WGF for example) More unfortunately yet, his EWGF
sets up some really evil juggles like EWGF, EWGF, f+1,b+2,1 which is
plain evil not to mention DAMAGING. Also Heihachi is has tools of his
own like 1+2 which is damn useful though lacking in range. It is vital
you becareful with your pokes especially 4 and 1~1 since Heihachi will
be able to duck under those high attacks (from his CD) and pop you up.
Since EWGF does not track well though (well not DEWGF that is) you
should emphasize your sidestep game and punish him with 4,4,1 plus
juggle should your opponent get really predictable with his EWGF
setups. Btw do not be too hasty about ducking once you see your
opponent goes into CD because he can do the tsunami Kicks or even f,f+2
demon uppercut to juggle for more damage. His hell sweeps though toned
down a bit from T3 is still evil. After the initial sweep you still
have to guess whether he will continue with more sweeps or the rising
kicks failing to do so will result in at least 50 pts gone. Since
Heihachi is after all a Mishima, all the Mishima techniques like WD,
LD, snake dash, whatever dash is available to him. It is best to stay
on top of Heihachi with loads of pokes, elbows etc and not let him get
into CD. However should he inevitably get into his CD (and thus CD mix
up) it is vital to stay cool. Simple things like d+1 to a hopkick can
interrupt the WD as long as you keep your cool. I will cover more of
this when I go to Jin's vs strats. The new addition to Heihachi's
arsenal is his wonderful WS+2 which though slightly slow, has good
range and built in sidestep. It stuns on CH and gives him good
opportunity for juggle. Beware of this move especially the iWS and CD
cancel ones. Should heihachi try d+1,2 you can interrupt after blocking
the initial falling leaf with 1~1,1 for kick ass damage.

p/s I don't hate Heihachi as much now... I HATE JIN.

Hwoarang (aka Bob)
Difficulty: Hard
Since I do not play Bob and have trouble describing his moves (RFF,
LFF, whatever) I have requested people on TZ to write in with their
comments on him.

Night Sez:
----------

Vs A stringing Bob:
This can be annoying. At first it may seem impossible to get out of his
strings, i.e 3,3,3,4,2, f+3,1, f+4,2, RFF 2, d+3,4,3, f+3,3,3,4,4, f+
3,1, f+4,2 etc etc..
However, you can counter this tactic effectively if you know how. It's
easy to recognise the string happy bob. He/she will be happily chaining
kick after kick, using jabs to go out of Flamingo, and abusing RFF 2.
Most of these hits will give him frame advantage, so don't even think
about CH 1~1,1 to stop him... that's just what he wants you to try. The
trick is to know what is high and what is mid. I.E - d+3,4 - a good
player can duck automatically after they see the Sm d+3, thus avoiding
the 4 and being able to hit Bob with WS moves. A good bob stringer will
mix mid moves finishers into his strings, the most common being LFS 2,
RFS 1, df+2, RFS 4, df+3,4, LFS b+4 and RFS b+3. Even with these moves
mixed in, it's still quite easy to duck a Bob string and WS+4/FC,df+4,3
him with Julia. Generally the safest time to duck a Bob string is when
he has finished in RFF, because he will most likely use RFF 2 or RFF 3~
4 at that point, both of which are high. RFF 2,4~f,f+4 is also
excellent, but the first 2 hits are high, and can easily be ducked and
WS'd before he gets the RFF f+4 in. He can of course, use RFF f+4~4 to
pop you up, but a d+1 can stop this kind of business, and RFF f+4~4 is
also quite risky (if blocked standing). Of course, the safest mid
option for a RFF Bob is probably df+3,4 (mid) but getting hit with this
while ducking isn't as bad as being caught in a string. Ducking while
Bob is still in the flamingo part of a string is dangerous, as he could
use a heel lance (RFS b+3 or LFS b+4) to launch you.
This kind of bob will also love using the Flamingo sweeps followed by
okizeme - i.e RFS d+3, ws+4,4, db+4... if you're fast, df parry the
sweep and df+2,1 him.
Another option to kill a string happy Bob is to back dash out of his
string range, and then CH 1~1,1 or CH 4 him while he doesn't have the
block advantage from his strings. This doesn't work vs a good bob
often, but against infinite stringers, they won't seem to understand
that you just popped out of their string range and your next hit will
be faster than their 3,3,3,4,3 etc...

Vs a freestyling, 3xssing Bob:
This is difficult, I can't really help much with this. I'm not sure if
Julia has any moves which track SS well, especially a bob 3xss (which
certainly beats Julia's 3xss). (ILuvMomo: 4,4 is pretty good against SS
as long as they are within range. 4,4, can track pretty well)

Jack 2
Difficulty : Easy
The rating here can be very misleading. The reason I rated Jack 2 as
easy is because Julia has more advantage over him due to her speed and
his size. However do not assume that Jack 2 is a walk in a park. In
fact he is anything but that. Jack2 has of course 10 frame pokes in his
2,1,(2). Usually these pokes are used for him to play keep away games
since they have good range. f+1+2, df+2 is also another move which
knocks you far away even when blocked. His foot stomp, f,f+3 is used a
lot! When blocked it causes a huge guard stun so that he is able to set
up his next move. As an okizeme attack, it is great too not to mention
a great tag juggle finisher for class 4 launchers. His Windup punch
hcf+2, equally is great to set up his throws because of the INSANE
guard stun. Throws? He has a multitude of them. However I will just
mentioned the most common ones = db,F+1+2 tombstone piledriver and
df,df+1 modified catapult. Tombstone does insane damage on its own but
he also has okizeme opportunity. Modified catapult does very lil damage
on its own (30 points) but the ability to juggle of it speaks volumes.
He can do a simple d+1+2 Bravo Knuckle and tag out for a tag dive, f+3+
4 ram  or the deathfist like move, Megaton Punch for oodles of damage.
Oh yeah, his f+3+4 shoulder ram, although not as good as King's (due to
poorer range) does insane damage plus leaves him safe. Since I have
already covered his Bravo knuckle when discussing GunJack, I won't
repeat it here again. Due to his size and difficulty to juggle, use 1~
2,1 most if not all of the time. SS f+1+2 works wonders against Jack 2
(and other big characters) since you get get huge juggles off it. Use
b+4 a LOT to interrupt his slower power moves. Overall though, fighting
Jack 2 is a matter of spacing. If you manage to keep the pressure on
your opponent in close without allowing space, you would be able to
take the match easily.

Jin Kazama
Difficulty : Godlike
I think I will be wasting time telling you about all his moves, when he
actually needs like 5 moves to win. 1. EWGF 2. Hell sweep 3. WS+2 4.
b,f+2,1,2 5. b+4. Thats ALL Jin really needs to win. All the other
moves are just nice additions to his arsenal. Jin is deadly because he
has the ultra cheap, ultra effective and ultra boring wave dash into
WS+2/hell sweeps mixup. Problem isn't just in the guessing game - the
damage he can deal out in juggles is extremely high and ridiculously
simple. Moreover, you can't really do anything when he wave/lightdash
towards you since EWGF will interrupt almost everything. Forget it, I
won't waste time giving strats on how to defeat Mishima wave dash
because if I could I would easily be the best player around. Just hope
you get lucky during his guessing game and of course punish him
severely when he pokes carelessly when at a frame disadvantage. Chances
to punish Mishimas are few and far between so capitalize on that.

Although at the surface Jin may seem to have the same okizeme options
as his dad, it is completely different because of his WS+2... yes the
rising uppercut. It is with this move that Jin is able to use OB trap
to such effectiveness. For those who do not know what it is, OB trap is
basically stands for Okizeme Back trap. Basically your opponent tempts
you to rise and then interrupts your rising animation with a d+1 which
backturns you. To get a better idea do download Tommy vs Shauno 2
semifinal match at Electriccancel.com and see how he uses it to great
effect. Jin players will usually trip you using a single hell sweep. He
will then wiff a df+4 and knowing sensing that you are going to rise
with an attack, immediately do d+1. Since d+1 is but 8 frames, it will
interrupt the animation of your attack hence backturning you and giving
him a free WS+2 and juggle. Of course Kazuya has the this trick too,
but what makes Jin more formidable is again his juggling capabilities
as well as the good range of WS+2 (Kaz's twin pistons has the tendency
to wiff at maximum distance so that will be a Ling BK 4 + juggle to
you) Other ways a good player might set up the OB trap is jumping over
you while you are down and do d+1. All I can say is be very careful and
do not stupidly rise and attack if your opponent wiffs a move because
most of the time (assuming he is a good player) wiffs it on purpose to
bait you into his trap.

*note* If Jin is teamed up with Heihachi, he will have the opportunity
to turn into Devil Jin after a force block (b+1+2) In this form, Jin's
body is surrounded with electric. Along with a new string, Jin's WGF
will now hit Medium and juggles you higher.

Julia Chang
Difficulty : not rated
If you don't know by now what to expect from Julia Chang, you are
wasting your time reading this FAQ. Forget it. Go do something else
instead like play DOA2.

Jun Kazama
Difficulty : Easy
Scrubs think they are invincible when using Jun's infinite strings
which are definitely gay. Not only are they slow (like her leg cutters)
but also they have soooooooo many loopholes and most of the time hit
high. Duh! Crouch, CH WS+2,4,1 do the rest yourself. In the hands of
skillful players watch for Julia's b+2, 1+2 a LOT. Look for them to
delay the 1+2 to catch you on CH. b+2 is by far her BEST poke in the
game and has great range too. It is also great in Okizeme games to
juggle rolling opponents and can be initiated from SS. 1+2 looks a lot
like Heihachi's sanchin palm, only it stuns on any hit. On its own, it
is a slow crappy move with almost no range.However, Jun players use
this a lot especially since the stun cannot be escaped. There are many
ways of setting up it such as  1,2, 1+2, blocked f,f+2, 1+2 (thanks
MIC)and 1,1,3, 1+2 (thanks Shinjin) just to name a few. f,f+2 is prolly
her best move with its built in sidestep. It works much like Jin's f,f+
2 only better IMO. SS+4 of Jun is an equally ideal poke. On CH her
opponent is placed on their stomach. Jun can get a free 3+4 cartwheel
flip or look to set up OB trap with WS+3+4, 3+4. Her standing 4 will be
used a lot much like Julia's standing 4. On CH jun gets free 1+4, 2,4
juggle. Her df+4 will be used a lot for keep away games, a must in
Jun's case. A  things to note too is that Jun has b+1 sparrow trap. It
looks like a slow gay low hit, but it ducks real low and should it CH
it auto reverses. If players abuse it too much, just double/ triple SS
behind her and 4,4,1 her juggle. Her standing 2 juggles everyone
(including fatties) and will be her main launcher. Good Jun players
stray from F+2 since that move has poor recovery and overall poor range
(it sometimes wiffs an opponent who stands next to her for inexplicable
reasons) F+2 does duck under high pokes though so becareful about
throwing out too many standing 4s. Jun's main downfall is her lack of
damaging juggles coupled with poor stamina which sums up to her quick
downfall.

Kazuya Mishima
Difficulty : Almost as Godlike like Jin
I'm not going to waste time with him either. Kazuya has the same stupid
CD mixup game as Jin which ultimately makes him one of THE best players
of the game. Instead of WS+2, Kazuya has WS+1,2 twin pistons which is
IMO is better since its faster. One thing about Kazuya though is that
he just doesn't have the power in the juggles unlike Jin. Kazuya's
damaging juggles are extremely hard to do compared to Jin's cheap
combos. However, WGF/WS+1,2, 4 is extremely damaging and cheap, not to
mention it positions Kazuya so well that he can continue putting
pressure on you with his Wave dash.
Well if you are actually looking for other things, then Kazuya has df+2
gut punch which does solid damage on its own and insane on CH + clean.
After the stun Kazuya can do some cheap juggles like u+4,4,4,4 or
extremely hard ones like WGF, WGF, df+4,4. By now you should know that
Kazuya's WS+2 has already been severely weakened so much so that it can
be escaped either by tagging out or tapping f. His f+1+2 is slow but
has good range and delivers the same stun too. Guess you are going to
be bored with the same ol combos real soon. Also since Tekken 2, Kazuya
has his mist step (f,n) which adds more dimension to his game. Besides
he can perform WGF faster than other mishima's by using Mist step
cancel. His WGF comes out at the speed of EWGF, though without the EWGF
guard stun, his is susceptible to quick pokes should WGF be blocked in
close. If WGF is blocked in close, you can get a free standing 4.
Overall though, Kazuya is going to be a tough nut to crack so just hope
you get lucky and manage to guess right when he mixes up.

King
Difficulty : Medium
Moves to watch out for with King is his d+1,N+2 poke. Most if not ALL
of the time, should you attempt an elbow he will reply with d+1,N+2. If
you do ANYTHING other than block you will get out poked. Also you have
to be very familiar with his throw set ups. Fortunately, his G.Swing is
not as good as your Mad Axes, though it is still very bufferable into
anything. Some of the setups are 2,1, G. Swing, WS+4, G. Swing, Jump
in, G. Swing, fake low parry, G. Swing etc. Fortunately the throw is a
1 break throw and the damage isn't too great...... if you know how to
tech roll out of it. Teching Giant swing will reduce the damage from
half (35 from original 70) plus it is very easy once you get the timing
down (tech it like you would tech normally) Even if you don't have the
timing down, just mash and more than likely you will get lucky and tech
the throw. His most damaging throw will be the dreaded Tomb Stone
piledriver (db,F+2). King has the luxury of being able to do it ala Mad
Axes and throw in a sidestep in between (QCB,SS,f+2) If it hits, King
gets a free ground throw attempt (1+2 break) but most of the time if
not all you would consider yourself lucky to be able to break the
ground throw since it has only 4 frames to input the break! Even so,
King is at least guranteed an elbow drop (d+1+2) Big damage. And lets
not forget the 3rd throw King has, his Muscle buster (QCB+1+2). One
good thing though is that King's BK 3 is not guranteed after QCB+1+2
since Julia is relatively small sized. Do not lie there too long though
since King can punish you with the Moon sault. His Moon sault is prolly
one of the most effective unblockables in the game, since a lot of
people will just FREEZE and look at it land. Don't. Poke him out of it,
whether standing 1, 4, hopkick whatever... even SS it. Also be very
familiar with his multithrows. At intermediate level a lot of players
like his RDC, but IMO its pretty useless at higher level of play since
people will break the Chicken wing. At a higher level, they usually go
for his Leg Hold (f,n,d,df+2+3) Unless you really are good at guessing
throw breaks, you have to break the Leg Hold at the start. If you
should get into the Leg Hold and are not sure, just mash 1+2 to
exercise damage limitations (your opponent won't be able to get the
indian deathlock which is by far the most damaging link) Lastly for
Power moves, King has many, f,f+2+3 body splash, f+2+3 shoulder ram, 1+
2,2 the backhand combo. If body splash is blocked, you get free d+3. I
strongly advice against sidestepping the shoulder ram unless you are
very sure. This is because King being large, is hard to sidestep. Its
not worth risking to sidestep unless you are sure about it. Besides
after blocking the shoulder ram you get a free WS+1 (the shoulder ram
forces you into FC). There is also a very famous set up, for the
shoulder ram. Irish whip. You can escape the shoulder ram by tagging
out (which you should do..DUH!) As for 1+2,2 King players usually use
it off a SS, so if you are expecting that, SS it for most of the time,
a backthrow. If it is blocked you are pushed far away. As for juggling,
King doesn't have much juggling options. He has u+4 which is very very
safe. His other launchers like FC,df+2, FC,df+1, are unsafe so you will
rarely see them used unless you wiffed a move.

Kuma/Panda
Difficulty : Easy
Kuma is IMO, much better than the Jacks (though most players say that
Jack 2 is the best of the bunch). He is a big target and slow to boot
which makes poking and juggling so much more fun. However, as I said,
he makes up for that somewhat with excellent pokes because he has the
G-clef Cannon move of the Changs (performed f+1~1,1) which could juggle
you for some huge damage. The first punch of his G-Clef is 8 frames so
you should be very careful with your jabs. Kuma will try to play keep
away game with you with the long jabs, so attempt to close the distance
with elbows, d,df+1 or SS f+1+2s. Also another noteworthy move is his
f,f+2 which is the demon uppercut of Heihachi. It ducks under high
attacks and with his long paws has extra added lenght. Best yet it is a
class 1 launcher. However other than that, Kuma won't be a huge threat
to you.

Kunimitsu
Difficulty : Easy
Again, there aren't any good Kuni players in my arcades and I am still
in the process of learning how to play Kuni so I can't write much about
this. Basically Kuni is a Yoshimitsu clone with some moves to call her
own. Her d/f+2 uppercut isn't as good as Yoshimitsu due to its leser
range, but you should not underestimate it because she can do some mean
juggles off a single uppercut. You should have realized by now that if
you try 1~1,1 her uppercut will beat you anytime. Kuni has a move where
she disappears into the ground and comes flying out of the air with an
unblockable Sai attack (u+1+2) which she can mix up with the fake.
Though this unblockable can be easily seen a mile away, if you actually
get caught in it you will be juggled. Her fake is more important to her
game though and is great as evasive tactics.  Again becareful with your
moves since she can just disappear into the ground. Most Kuni players
use only her 2+4 throw (sword... i mean sickle bash) and db+1+3, Judo
toss which is prolly the most useful throws and sets up her Okizeme
game. Kuni's most dangerous weapon however, is her okizeme tactics. She
can keep you on the floor all day with moves such as her D,df+3,3,3,f+
4, poison wind (uf+3+4) and if you move she can nail you with an
unblockable (b+2 or f,f,(N)+2. Her unblockables are used a lot to
especially when you begin to turtle. Although she may not have as much
range as T.Ogre when it comes to the unblockables, it is still lethal.
I find Kuni very weak defensively even with her Earth Divide (d+1+2)
and her lack of versatile moves like Yoshi puts her a grade further
below. Do not underestimate Kuni even though she is said to be inferior
than you are.

Lee Chaolan
Difficulty : Easy ~ Medium
Finally, after playing Lee for sometime (and funny I took so long to
choose him since my surname too is Lee) I have got some ideas of how to
face at least an intermediate Lee opponent. Mind you, my Lee isn't
really that good, and I would welcome anyone out there to send in vs
Lee strats to me. One thing is for sure though, Lee is not Law even
though he has a lot of his moves.
Most Lee mashers like to do the stupid Inifinite Kick string. Block the
first few kicks and then punish them when you have the space. Parry,
df+2,1 and juggle. Simple as that. If you aren't confident, you can
always d+1 instead to interrupt Lee has a Class 1 tag launcher (d,db+4)
which, like all Class 1 launchers, you should be extra careful of. A
thing to note is that it does NOT juggle big characters. However it
comes out quick and ducks very low to avoid high and even some mid
attacks. Goodplayers though will not rely too much on d,db+4 since it
comes out on the slow side and will only use it to punish a slow
recovering move, high pokes or a stupid tag in. They will rely more on
Lee's Hop Kick and df+2. The thing with Lee though is the fact that a
lot of people underestimate his juggling prowess. This may be true as
most of his intermediate combos do very minimal damage, but if your
opponent is the master of f,f,N+3,4,4, then you could be in a bit of
trouble. Lee does have a very good, no-damage move in his Mist step.
Done by inputting f,N, his version of a Mist step moves him forward,
all the while, while keeping his guard up. Of course a low attack will
break up his intentions. At intermediate level, players try to mix up
f,f,N+3,4,4with f,f,N+3+4 for a 'guess high or low' game, since both
start off exactly the same. Once you get familiar with it though,
f,f,N+3+4 the Chaolan Slide can easily be seen and blocked. Follow up a
blocked slide with FC,df+4,3 and MC (which I must say is height
dependent) Poking with Lee usually involves his 4,4... kicks which has
good range and speed. I feel that 4,4 gives Lee as much frontal
advantage as your standing 4 will and will juggle on CH. Treat it as
you would with your own standing 4. d+3,3... is rather
cheesy since if the d+3 hits on CH, the rest of it is guranteed, and
you'd be surprised how often that will get you if you aren't careful.
If scrubs abuse it though.. LOL... the second low hit can be parried
even if the first hit... df+2,1 juggle time again. When Lee does his
FC,df+4 and wiffs, remember not to blindly rush in if he is partnered
with Kazuya since he can follow up with 2~2~1 unblockable and a
subsequent free hit.
Although Lee may seem a weak opponent at first, he has the right moves
for the right situation to counter anything that you can dish to him.
So do not always underestimate your opponent if he chooses Lee.

Lei Wulong
Difficulty : Medium / V.Hard
I don't think Lei is that difficult if you have enough experience
playing against Lei players. Lei is the master of stances and you must
know each and everyone of them as well as the moves from which they can
perform from the stance. Lei has some rather powerful moves but most of
his moves come out slow and easily interrupted. Also, from his stances,
most of his moves either hit High or Medium bar a few moves. Even then,
those moves are slow enough for you to block on reaction (acception is
PAN 1). Lei also has some moves and stances which will evade/parry
attacks. Take for instance his drunken headbutt (b+1+2) where he will
take a step back before delivering a headbutt. You have to becareful
when charging in because he could easily evade the attack you were
trying to dish to him and land you a blow on a CH. db+4 the low hitting
razor sweep has been toned down some what but it still is very very
dangerous when used since it is hard to see coming.

A lot of intermediate players abuse his PLD (d+3+4) like a football
player on drugs. This is prolly because a lot of people do not know how
to counter PLD position effectively. They think that PLD, roll forward
to Sweep/ Mule Kick mix up is good. Yeah right.... if they start this
nonsense from afar, charge up f+1+4 immediately and it will hit them
when they roll forward. However if they do it from dash distance, 4,4
is great at stopping their roll forward. Good players use PLD in
moderation only to duck attacks and not simply abuse it.

If you have even played an average Lei player you know what his game is
mostly about.... punch rush to Animal stance and mixups. Well here they
are in the order of Punch rush (ie after first punch in punch rush he
goes to snake, 2nd punch to dragon and so forth)

1) Snake :
He has 2 noteworthy moves here, 1,1,1,1,1 (the quick jabs) and 2,2,2
which is 2 mid swipes into a low swipe. Lei players will prolly use
2,2,2 a lot after db+4 sweep but watch for them to use 2,2 to induce
you to retaliate, after which they will follow up with f,n,4,1,2,3
or b+1+2,drunken headbutt for massive damage. Lei can go into DRG after
2,2 and PAN after 2,2,2.
2) Dragon :
If any Lei player goes ino Dragon and tries the grab, Duck and punish
him with FC,df+4,3 or any WS move. The grab can be escaped so easily so
if you get caught in it you DESERVE the guranteed elbow drop If he
tries 1+2 and you block it, your best bet is to continue blocking
because he will most likely follow up with a drunken headbutt. Also he
can go into TGR after a blocked 1+2 to mix things up. In DRG, Lei has
4,1,2,3. If 4 connects in CH, then the rest is guranteed. Look for Lei
players to bait you and then go for the CH. One particular example
would be blocked SNK 2,2 which then goes to DRG. From there, if you
even attempt anything stupid, he will CH you and that does shit loads
of damage.
3) Panther
This is where Lei starts to get really frightening. In panther he has
a mix up of low (in 1) or mid (in 2) I really have no advice as to tell
you where to block but lets just say I hope you get lucky. If 1 hits
then Lei is guranteed a WS+3_4 and if 2 hits he is guranteed any normal
juggle like he would off a hopkick. The fortunate thing is that 1 will
only trip in close. If it connects far away on a standing opponent, it
will be blocked. It sorta has a semi sM property. Don't get into a
habit of trying to d+1 or CH him with 1~1,1 everytime he goes into an
animal stance, since he can SS again and you will be wide open. Besides
he can low parry you in Panther (hold F). Take your time and watch him
carefully.
4) Tiger
Another dangerous position for you. In Tiger, Lei has another guessing
game. Duck and he will give you an overhead swipe and stun you which
then screams HOPKICK. On CH you will be bounced on the ground for a
juggle. Stand and block and Lei will give you a sweep in the forms of 4
and follow that up with a 4~4,3,3. The sweep is slow enough for you to
block on reaction and he will be guard stunned should it be blocked.
Also trying to out poke him in this situation is very dangerous since
he has tiger parry (hold F)
5) Phoenix
Neither is this a good stance for you. Watch for the low kick (4) to
catch you tagging in. This move has really good range. The phoenix
power punch is prolly another good move since it disorientates both
characters and is a good set up for a BK d+1 low backhand swipe and
juggle. The Phoenix dance (3,4,2,3) will prolly be used occasionally as
an Okizeme attack.

More advanced players employ a technique which is known as the 'Haha'
step. Basically, Lei dashes back by cancelling the backturn. (b~3~4, b,
b~3~4, b and so on) I must highlight how important it is to not dash
blindly into a backturned Lei because he can easily come out from it
with some razor punches. Go download the Tekken Tag Championship Finals
movie and watch how Seok makes full use of the Haha Steps. If you have
a partner like Jin and can light dash, then this is not a problem.
However if you can't then you might have some problems since he can
fustrate you. You could use tag slides or cross chops though it is NOT
a guranteed by any means. At a certain distance though, the tag slide/
cross chop is unavoidable so if you learn your spacing, use it often.
Other than that, your best bet is to play it save and back away. The
HaHa step technique pratically tranforms Lei from an averagefighter to
one that should be feared.

Ling Xiaoyu
Difficulty : Medium
If Ling and Julia had equal amount of Stamina, this match would have
been much harder. Instead, Julia holds the small upperhands in the
stamina department. Anyways what should you be looking out for with
Ling? BT 4 of course. Duh! Everyone knows about BT 4 but its the setups
which your opponent will use to make you eat it. One of the more
popular string is df+2, 1,2, df+1,2,4_throw. There are of course other
ways to get into BT position like f,f+3 Racoon swing which is an
excellent okizeme Move on its own, D+3,2,(1,4) and more. Be familiar
with them all. For Pokes, Ling players use 1,2 and f,f+1+2, 1+2 a lot.
Blocking f,f+1+2, 1+2 causes guard stun. On CH the last hit will bounce
you. A good advice is to sidestep it since it doesn't track well. Be
careful of your pokes because she can easily get into AOP. From AOP
Ling players usually go for 1+2 (hits mid) or 3 which trips. The
recovery for the low kick isn't all that cool though should it wiff.
Also she can hopkick off her AOP, and mix up when she wants to kick to
boot.  Against Ling, you will be eating as many pokes as you will deal
out to her. However just keep cool. Bear in mind that she is a lil
girl and as such takes damage like one so be patient and wait for the
opening. Nothing is worst than getting fustrated and just hitting 1~
1,1. A few spanks to her will probably end the round in a jiffy. Funny
thing though is Ling has been tonned down quite a bit from Tekken 3
(she was among the top 5 fighters IMO in Tekken 3) but yet, she still
holds her own.

Michelle
Difficulty : Hard
She plays the same as Julia, but she has a few moves to call her own.
Namely the df+3+4 and SS+3~4, both juggle starters. Her SS+3~4 puts her
sidestepping game leagues better than Julia's even though the SS+3~4
may miss at times (it has to be near to be sure of connecting). Her df+
3+4 ducks under high attacks and she will use it if you are not careful
with your pokes. A correctly timed df+3+4 can interrupt your high
pokes. The drawback about Mich's df+3+4 is its unpredictability though.
Sometimes the first kick will hit while the second will wiff
inexplicably... hopkick time! She too has 1~1,1, 1~2,1 which you should
be familiar by now. Therefore, be verycareful when using your strings.
Keep the pressure on her and do NOT let her get into her WS game. But
if the battle gets too intense and you find that she is getting the
upperhand, it is sometimes best to retreat and play on the defense. She
can be extremely dangerous if you allow her to get into a Crouched
position. One of her new moves, SS+2 is an excellent move for her to
get into FC position without any disadvantage to her. Like Jules, she
has loads of option from FC position. Worse though is if SS+2 hits you
(which happens often if you aren't too careful with pitbulling) then
WS+4 is guranteed. Speaking of WS+4 it will gurantee d+4 and sether up
in prime okizeme position. Besides her elbows are very different unlike
Julia since they do not knock away on CH and thus gurantee the Sky
Scrapper kick ---> Juggle. Look for a good Michelle player to
incorporate LOADS of elbows into his poking strategy. While I need not
discuss more on her FC,df+2 elbow on CH. Punish a blocked bow and arrow
kick (FC, df+4,3 or any of its variants) with a Shining fist or WGF
(though remember that good players will never ever use follow up with
the 3 unless the 4 connects). Julia can't rely fully on pitbulling
because Michelle herself can punish you in many ways. Michelle in fact
is equally good if not better at pitbulling than Julia. Michelle's is
rated Hard instead of V.Hard because Mich has very poor stamina so if
you just keep on top of her and do not allow her breathing space, she
will be out in no time.... though hitting her may pose to be the
biggest problem. I'd say play her like you would play Julia but keep in
mind their differences.

Mokujin / Tetsujin
Difficulty : -variable-
Can you tell which character your opponent is playing from the start by
just looking at the entrance animation or the way they move? If you can
that is a good start. Mokujin / Tetsujin is as good as the character
being used but in some cases the size factor makes it a bit different
(Mokujin is bigger than Ling but smaller than the Jacks for example).
You'd better be prepared to learn stances if you are to defeat an
expert Mokujin player.

Nina Williams
Difficulty : Easy
Nina has toned down to such a Gay level in TTT that she cannot be
considered one of the best characters anymore. In fact, many would
consider one of the worser characters. Her d+4,1 no longer hits low but
sM now which makes it practically useless except in juggles. This
really hurt her overall poking game though d+1,N+4 is still a useful
poke. Her Divine Cannon is 20 frames *eep!* and recovers very badly if
blocked. Near useless ness now if you ask me. Her CD game is gay since
she can't come out of it which much, unless you consider Bad Habit
Kick/ Multithrow mixups good. And btw whats with the Bad Habit kick on
girl fighters anyways? On CH it will stun so she gets to juggle. But
the Bad Habit kick is so easy to SS and you can punish her severely.
Note she doesn't take damage very well also. DC weakened, bad habit
Kick being easily SS'ed, Nina has to rely on small juggles from d+3,2.
She also can mix it up with d+3,d+4 so parry, df+2,1 and juggle. Same
goes with her 4,3,d+4_2 mixups. With so many new stuff, what has Nina
gained instead? Nothing much... SS+1 is okay if you ask me though the
lacck of range hurts her badly. SS+1+2 is bad. Also FC,df+4 or D,df+4
works somewhat like Law's db+4 only the range is much worst. It won't
trip unless it clean hits, and will leave Nina open for more
punishment. All in all, Nina has been weakened so severely that she has
to get lukcy if she has any hope of beating Julia.

Ogre
Difficulty : Medium
Ogre has moves stolen from a lot of Tekken 2 characters. Among some of
his moves is Kaz's DGP. Watch out for it because he will most likely
follow that up with a Waning Moon throw (break : 1+2 and can be tag
escaped) or a Hopkick juggle or a simple 4. He also has Lee Chaolan's
d~db+4 which is a great Tag launcher (not Class 1 though). Ogre has
probably one of the meanest Okizeme games with the inclusion of Kuni's
Unblockables (b+2 and f,f,N+2). Watch out for Lee's Infinite Kicks
which is a favourite among scrubs. Block the first four hits at most
and then retaliate. If Ogre uses his f,f+2, sidestep after the initial
punch to avoid the unblockable and then counter appropriately. Ogre can
poke too since he has your 1,1<2 and Bruce's df+1,2 (which sadly
doesn't juggle). Most of Ogre's moves are slow, powerful and if they
should connect, will almost always give him a frame advantage. Watch
out for his other unblockables (he has loads of them) and poke him out
of the act. As long as your keep the pressure on Ogre with tonnes of
pokes you should do fine.

Paul
Difficulty : Easy / Medium
At a Higher Level of Play, Paul is quite limited. His Mix up game is
severely weakened to the point of near uselessness since d+4 in the
falling leaf will only trip on Clean hit and the range for a Clean hit
is extremely small. Therefore, Paul has to rely on quick pokes like df+
1, 1,2, and standing 4. His Standing 4 has more range than Julia, comes
out just as quick and he gets a free Deathfist (or 1,1,1, Deathfist) on
CH. For Juggles, Paul usually relies on WS+2, df+2 and uf+4. QCF+1 for
the most part is not used at a higher level of play, since it hits high
and has poor recovery (no where near Anna's QCF+1 elbow). His weak
juggle starters is made up for with his power moves. Duh! Don't tell me
you haven't heard oOoooooooowaghhh at least once. His Deathfist does
LOADS of damage especially on CH+ clean hit. On netsu, it destroys 70%
of your life bar on ONE single hit. Other power moves are f+1+2 his new
over head punch which bounces you on CH and QCB,2. Another thing I like
to speak about is Paul's movement. At a higher level of play, Paul
playes like to use the Hayashida step. This queer looking step
(qcb~ub~u) has Paul backswaying and cancelling it into a SS. Again,
against SS moves, punish them during the SS animation with 4,4. I find
fighting Paul rather easy as long as you keep the pressure on him and
do not make silly mistakes which will allow him the opportunity to
deathfist you.

Prototype Jack
Difficulty : Easy
I have been playing P Jack a lot lately and after extensive play with
him I must say he has to be one of the weaker character in the game.
However thats not to say he is useless, far from it since he can
actually hold his own. 2+4 throw is prolly the only throw a PJack
player will use along with db+2+3 since 1+3 throw is pathetically
slow (Pjack Press) Anyways back to 2+4 throw. It has one of the
biggest range and can (and will be) linked into b,d,db,d,df,F+2
gigaton punch. You can actually block the punch, but since you only
have 1 frame to do so and failing to do so would mean the punch counts
on CH, my recommendation is that you just take the damage unless you
really must take the risk (say the blow would kill you otherwise) or
are very sure of your timing. Most of Pjacks moves are rather slow, but
have good range. SS moves like SS+1+2 is a perfect example. The range
is extremely good but the startup time is poor. You should be
pressuring him continuously with elbows and pokes in close while
closing distance well with moves such as f+1+2. I find f+1+2 is very
useful against Jacks since his long range moves is slower than yours.
Again just to remind you, off SS CH f+1+2 you can do meaty juggles.
However Pjack does have a rememdy for that in his Glock Up. Thanks to
Brahma for this nice tip (dood when is you and Trekk's PJack FAQ coming
out?), Pjack can continously do his Glock Up (b+1+2) and cancel that
with b infinitely to do a weird dance. If you should get caught by the
force block, f+1+2 is guranteed. When we talk about PJack, anything
guranteed is big damage. Other abused stuff are 1+2<1+2 where Pjack
players will delay the second hit to hope to catch you on CH. Should a
PJack player do Torpedo Jack f+3+4 to end a round and fail to do so,
punish him properly for that since the recovery for the move is
horrible. (Blocking/wiffing that moves gurantee's you an unblockable if
timed right) However this move is great to catch people tagging out for
that last sliver of life. Lastly, when Pjack comes tagging in, be
cautious since he can cancel his tag run in into the Stomp unblockable.
If you are too eager to attack, you will be caught out and *Crunch*
there goes a chunk of your life.

True Ogre
Difficulty : Medium
Refer to Ogre to get a basic idea of what True Ogre has in store for
you. The difference between True Ogre is he is way bigger (so most of
his attacks have added range), has that irritating flame attack (which
scrubs abuse), can't be juggled (or at least you have to get used to
the change in timing should he try to fly away) and has an unblockable
horn attack (3+4 when KND). With his added range, T.Ogre's DGP will
have more range, therefore, scoring a hit will be a little bit easier.
Not only that. Because of the added range, should T.Ogre's DGP get
blocked at the maximum distance, he is relatively safe from anything
but a quick poke. Moreover True ogre has a good WS game as he has the
FC, df+2 which hits low (the low backhand swipe which was stolen from
Anna) True ogre has moves like df+1+2 the horn uppercut which ogre does
not have. Good players will use df+1+2 a lot both as an okizeme attack
to catch players back rolling, tagging in/out and as a juggle starter.
Even though it is rather slow, the horn uppercut ducks under high
attacks, so be very careful with your poking strings. A df+1+2 juggle
takes off ass loads of damage. Also the horn unblockable has VERY good
range, and unless you time it perfectly, the horn unblockable will hit
you when tagging in even if you tag cancel. If T. Ogre is partnered
with Lei, then after Lei's 1+3~5 throw, T. Ogre is guranteed a df+1+2 I
think. Anyways, other not so common moves to watch out for is f,f,N+3+4
which is the same as Lee's slide, SS+4 (pure crap) Watch out for his
flame attack and remember to punish those scrubs for abusing it. Good
players do use the flame too... suprisingly... but they do so to waste
time especially when you are a full screen's distance from them. Also,
the flame attack is a very good to bait opponent. Don't go carelessly
running in because you could be at the end of df+1+2. Personally, I
like double flame at full range before bashing the rushing in opponent
with f+2. Again remember the unblockables. More unfair is you can't
juggle him properly since he can easily fly backwards to avoid
subsequent hits.DARN! For example if you try an elbow combo on him, he
could escape the combo by flying after eating the first elbow. Of
course if he times it wrong, he is subject to even MORE elbows. I
strongly suggest going for strong moves (like d,df+1,2) after launching
him. If he is flipped over, then of course he cannot escape. However,
T. Ogre's size is his main downfall since he is slow and should be
played much like you would play Ogre - all out offense. If you manage
to hit T.Ogre down, okizeme him to death. T.Ogres fat size is sooooooo
okizeme encouraging. Oh one last thing, remember that you can always SS
after blocking f,f+2 (the semi unblockable twister attack) That move is
the ultimate scrub killer. Do what you do best.... get in close and
deny him the space that he needs. Elbows, 1's 4's df+4s whatever... do
NOT give him any space.

Wang Jinrei
Difficulty : Easy
Hmmm... if you thought that Heihachi being alive was impossible , this
fella is a greater exagerration. Anyways though, I think that Wang
should just be put to rest because his stamina is attrocious. Moreover,
he has poor frame data. His moves are slow to recover and even slower
to come out. Be careful though of his db+4,2 combo on CH because if the
db+4 connects on CH, the 2 is guranteed and leads to a very damaging
(and easily done combo) Nothing much to worry about though since the
punch recovers like er....does it actually recover? The recovery time
is so slow you prolly can go make yourself a cup of coffee before
coming back to df+2,1 the scrub for abusing the move. Wang has a
deathfisttoo but it is no where as cheap as Paul's. Becareful when
poking with 1,1,>2 (Shining fist) as Wang has an Unchickenable Left
Punch reversal (he can reverse other moves too but only left punches
are unchickenable) Wang may be disadvantaged with his poor frame data
BUT he has enough tricks to pull out of the hat to defeat you if you
take him on lightly. Look for him to abuse SS+1+2 the heatbutt move
sincethat is one of the rare moves where he isn't at a frame
disadvantage. If you get caught by it, you are in DEEP shit I tell you.
The Frame advantage he gets allow him to get in with his mixups/
throws. You know by now that his most dangerous throw is his Waning
Moon (df, df+2+4) which offers LOADs of damaging follow ups. Most
follow ups however can be escaped be it tagging out or d+1. Oh another
thing, don't worry about Wang's FC,df+4,3.... the 3 isn't even
guranteed if the 4 hits. Keep the heat on him and he will be done.

Yoshimitsu
Difficulty : Hard
Yoshi is very dangerous for many reasons. First off, he has the
infamous df+2 uppercut which is the best basic uppercut in the game
(what uppercut?!? Like DJ sez, its more like a WGF damnit!). It
comes out fast, has good range, ducks under high attacks and has insane
priority. Off a single df+2 uppercut, Yoshi can do a juggle which will
take more than 40+ life off of ya. Worse yet, Yoshi can tag buffer his
df+2 in TTT which means that there is 0 badv for you since there is a
small guard stun and worse still, df+2 will juggle you even when
crouched whether on CH or not. (normally df+2 on crouching opponents
require it to be on CH for it to launch) A lot of Yoshi players use
this in conjunction with his sidestep b+3+4. In TTT, Yoshi has also
gained the benefit a SS moves in SS+1 and SS+2. SS+1 will be used the
most by good players since it has good range, does decent amounts of
damage and juggles on CH. Not to forget his unorthodox starter in the
forms of a head/shoulder charge off his pogo stick stance. Yoshi
players will go into pogo stance when you are on the ground hoping for
two things i) you tag out and they nail you with the pogo headbutt
hoping for CH or 2) you move (or lie around) in which he runs you over
with the pogo stick. Although the Roo Kick (4~3) isn't used much by
good players, be warned that IF it does connect, you are in a major
world of hurting. Yoshi has loads of unblockables some of which are
very useful. Yoshi's QCF+1 (flip in air with sword) is used a lot even
by good players. Be prepared to sidestep it. If the match is running
out of time, you can be sure Yoshi players will use the spinning sword
attack to waste time should he be winning or do a jump-in suicide move
as a last attempt to get a Double KO if he is low on life anyways. I
don't know how many times this has happened but players will freeze
when Yoshi jumps in.... a simple d+1 or 1 would the the trick. Yoshi's
jump in Knee or Fubuki (f,f+4) which has exceptional speed and priority
and is mostly used to punished wiffed or slow recovering attacks. If
you do block the Fubuki though, make sure to punish Yoshi to the
fullest because it has a long recovery time. Good Yoshi players also
make use of the Bad Breath attack so when you do see Yoshi turning back
ready to blow, CROUCH, and FC,df+4,3 him. Beware of Yoshi when he goes
into FC position because he can come out of it with a FC, df+3 which
hits low and sets up a juggle. Speaking of going into FC position, a
lot of Yoshi players like to make use of his low thrust (d+1+3) to
deceptively get into Crouched position. Be aware of the options that
Yoshi has off his FC (like FC,df+3 and sword sweep) One last thing,
Yoshi has the infamous b+1+4 yoshi's flash which I reckon is the
FASTEST move in the game.... so think twice about barraging in with a
whole arsenal of attacks. This move is has the fastest startup at a
minimal 4 frames...THATS faster than any jab you know! Yoshi players
will use the flash to punish aggresive pitbull players. Also he may set
it up in many ways. An example would be a wiffed roo kick when you are
on the ground. Play smartly against Yoshi because he has a lot of
"useless" moves which he can utilize at the right situation to turn the
tide in his favour.

DayFul's favorite partners
--------------------------

1) Yoshi
Where do I start there are so many reasons why you should use Yoshi
with Julia. If I was going to rank ideal Julia partners Yoshi would be
a very close second to Jin but I hate Jin (As does 90% of the tekken
community). His d/f+2 is very good it even launches fat characters and
it's garunteed off a parried low kick when a tag is buffered sick. Also
his SS+2 will lauch for the wonder juggle also, his SS+1 is excellent
and safe when blocked but with Julia as his partner i'd be more
inclined to use SS+2. Yoshi compliments Julia well in that he doesn't
need to rely on CH to get damage. He has plenty of poking cheese like
his 1,2,1 which is a true combo, yea the damage is sad compared to
Julia's CH 1~2~1 but it's easy to connect with an 8 frame jab. His f,f+
4 is very fast and can interupt pretty much everything as it's only 7
frames it does plenty of damage as well. Prob with Yoshi his d/f+4 has
been raped, his d/f+4 rocked in T3 and I used it a hell of a lot it's
now almost wiped out of my Yoshi gameplay as it's has been slowed down
and it doesn't even seem to have as much range even though the
animation is the same. That problem aside Yoshi is a top notch Julia
partner who I would recommend to anyone.

2) Armor King
Ok his black upper isn't anywhere near as good as a WGF but it's still
awesome. He is LOADED with power shots that as you know Julia lacks
also he has good reach as iLuvMomo said his hopkick is one of the best
due to the excellent recovery and reach it has. He is an excellent
poker with his d+1,N+2 2,1 1,2 ect, he's got plenty of painful throws
and a ground throw, his handcuff clitch has been removed from the PS2
but it was gay anyway. He is a fairly good juggler himself but nothing
special. I could just as easily put King here instead they're both
excellent as stand alone characters and compliment Julia well.

3) True Ogre
He was rated as a 6 well that was a major comprimise I would have rated
him as a 9. As far as teaming up with Julia is concerned all *it* lacks
is a reliable launcher but realy you don't need one as True Ogre does
such huge damage anyway. It has excellent reach and fast power shots
and it has EASILY the best okizemie in TTT once your on the floor it's
very difficult to get up safely and often the round is over. Just check
out Shafi Vs Shauno round 5 at electriccancel to see what can happen.
The only problem here is that it's so huge a fellow Chang or Mishima
can kill True Ogre very quickly once it's down. Learn to control your
spacing and true Ogre can be a very good partner and there is always
huge comeback potential with it.

4) Bruce
Duhh did you think Bruce would not be on this list he's just so cheap.
You can stick cheese knees on the end of 1~1,1 and elbows on the end of
his d/f+2 (Which connects frighteningly often for a quick safe move
that tracks well). He's got plenty of good pokes like F+2,4 which is a
true combo an 8 frame jab with very good reach and on CH he can go
damage comparable to 1~2~1. He has very few low attacks and throws
Julia covers that problem up perfectly though, while Bruce has a
reliable instant juggle starter and poking cheese. Sadly his b,f+4
isn't taggable as it launches very high but he can just use an u/f,N+4
in to cheese knees anyway. O and he has 3,2,1 nuff said there.

5) Hwoarang
I think all that is lacking here is an instant class 2 juggle starter,
however he does have a 16 frame class 1 juggle starter so have fun tag
jugling. He has an easy 3,3,4,3 off Julia's 1~1,1 for plenty of red bar
damage. Bob's overall style compliments Julia's well as he plays a more
standing non CH orientated game and his 3xSS is excellent so both of
them can play an equally confusing SS game. Last but not least Bob is
probobly the only character who has anything in common with Julia there
4 outfits.


iLuvmomo's favourite partners
-----------------------------

1) Jin
Don't think I will say much. Jin alone can win the game for you. WD,
EWGF, b+4, Hell Sweeps, WS+2. End of story.

2) Bryan
Bad ass team. Bryan can do whoopass damage with his stuns, plus having
2 of the coolest throws in the game doesn't hurt. Also Bryan's WS+1 is
very very useful since it launches to near Class 1 height. Sadly it
lacks range though. His new b+1~5 is sooooooooo abusable plus Julia has
very good ability to juggle off it. Plus Bryan covers what Julia lacks
- power hits, good launches and adds to that even more bad ass juggles.

3) Lei
Duno... mixups are good. Lei's mixups is the best. Stance are cool. Lei
has the coolest stance. Too bad he doesn't have any good generic
launchers or he would rate even higher. But Lei is really fun to use
especially if you want to impress your opponents with your stance
changing ability.

I'd like to thank the following people.

My sister you're hardly ever home these days but your cool as hell and
have a talent for going out with people I actualy like. Dave hopefully
this can help you get a clue of how to beat my Julia ;p. All the guys
who play me at Casears thanks for giving me the encouragement to keep
getting better. The people who always pick the Bob Eddy team funny as
hell and good class 1 juggle practice LOL. All the guys on TZ Rev,
Night bluu, Devil_Jin and of course iLuvMomo who without I'd prolly
have made a mess of this FAQ. You guys are funny as hell and make TZ
far more entertaining and useful. All the people who are actually
interesting in CCC DK, Tapion and Ultros for your ridiculous post rate,
and KenshiChan thanks for the Julia pic and keep up the good work you
do. And Castel for making such an awesome site that I spend too much
time on shame there's only 1 Julia combo vid still. And I apologise to
anyone who was expecting to see me at Euro3 sadly I can't make it this
year but hopefully I'll have the time and money to get there next year
for T4.

And lastly the following bands need credit for saving me from having to
listen to the atrocious music on the PS2 TTT. Alice in chains, Pearl
Jam, Nirvana, Metallica (Please don't hit me), Cold, Limp Bizkit, Korn,
Deftones Nine inch nails and many more.


iLuvMomo Likes to Thank
***********************

Well thats all for now, and these are the people I would like to show my
gratitude to.

1) Momo
Well, she is no more a part of my life any more since we broke up this
past new year, but she still lives within me and still is the
inspiration of which this work would never have been completed.

2) Dayful
Duh! Isn't this obvious? For helping co-write this damn long FAQ which
is wayyyyy wayyyyy past its sell by date. LOL

3) Castel
For his great work at TZ. It is always updated (though the movelist for
Julia still has errors) Of course I pulled off the movelist and
referred to the frame data from TZ throughout the course of the work.

4) Redfoot, Catlord, Priz, MIC, Tragic
These doods are cool. Unlike the pros here, these guys are very
friendly and would gladly share info with me (except for Priz who on
countless occasions flames my ass for making retarded statements) Extra
thanks go to Cat for his movelist and Redfoot for giving me the idea of
the Mad Axes buffering madness. And of course Priz, for flaming me
countless times so that I know where I am going wrong.

5) RevC, bluu, Night, Jonman_Mishima, Lomber, Carnage etc.
All those TZ and/or #tekken people who were able and willing to look
through my initial FAQ and comment on it. It was because of Night's
comments about the FAQ saying that most of the info contained were
already knowned info that I strived my best to add more info which even
the advanced players may not know. Night, I hope you like the Secret
info I learnt from Shafi. Rev for his excellent Layout of FAQ which I
have used. Rev... I'm still awaiting your response.

6) Blacksmith, Chinky-Eye
For being really interesting to chat with on ICQ and also sharing with
me the latest in Tekken.

7) Han Tzen, Han Shin, Ken, Ah Foong,Ah Seng, Chandra
For beating my ass up constantly so that I always am reminded how much
practise I need. Han Shin (my sinsei) is the reason why I actually
started playing Julia in the first place, and I still get owned by his
Julia. Most of them just OWN me and give me a real bad trashing.

8) Anyone else
