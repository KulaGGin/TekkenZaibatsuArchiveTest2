//-------------------//
//  1.2. Stick Tips  //
//-------------------//

Below are tips on some of the stick motions required by some of the
Changs' important moves.  If you have trouble doing moves like the
Changs' Rapid Counters or Julia's Cross Arm Suplex (or even other
characters' moves such as Lee's Blazing Kick), or have trouble
doing five or more elbows in a juggle, look here.

* f,F (or f,F#) -- "dash buffering"
-----------------------------------
All moves with the stick input f,f, such as the Changs' f,f+1, can be
done with f,F.  In addition, you can hold the stick after the second
forward tap for a fraction of a second before you need to press the
button(s).  This will cause your character to run a short distance
before the move execution.  Obviously, the distance this short run
covers effectively increases the range of the move.  In this guide,
this technique will be referred to as "dash buffering".  For the
Changs, dash buffering is important because it gives their Party
Crasher more reach, which is necessary in some juggles.

* d,DF (or DF)
--------------
This is used by the Changs' d,DF+1 and Michelle's d,DF+2.  To execute
such moves, tap down then quickly roll the stick to the appropriate
diagonal and hold the stick there.  As soon as your character begins
to crouch, press the appropriate button(s).

One note, you do not need to tap down.  In fact, all you need to do
is hold DF, then press the appropriate button(s) as soon as your
character begins to crouch.  The execution of the Changs' d,DF+1
is not unlike that of Bruce or Bryan's DF+3 (Snake Edge).

* FC,DF
-------
This is used by the Changs' FC,DF+2.  To do it, your character must
be in a full crouch first.  Once your character is fully crouched,
move the stick to the appropriate diagonal and hold it there.  As
soon as your character begins to crouch walk, press the appropriate
button(s).

There is an alternative to the above.  If you are standing, you can
simply hold the diagonal.  As soon as your character is crouched
fully and begins to crouch walk, press the appropriate button(s).

* FC,db,d,DB
------------
This is the stick motion for Julia's Cross Arm Suplex.  It can be
tricky to do.  Your character must be in a full crouch first.  Once
your character is fully crouched, you need to roll the stick quickly
to the first diagonal, then down, then back to the first diagonal in
one continuous motion, and hold the stick at the diagonal.  While
holding the stick, quickly press the appropriate button(s).

If you not familiar with this motion, I recommend you pick Law (or Lee)
and practice the motion for his Dragon Slide (FC,df,d,DF+3) because if
you do the stick motion alone correctly, Law will crouch slide forward
a small distance.  If you press 3 while Law is crouch sliding, he will
attack with the dragon slide.  Once you can do Law's slide consistently,
pick Bryan and try his Chains of Misery (C.O.M.) throw, which is
FC,df,d,DF+1+2.  Do the same stick motion as you did for Law's slide.
Unlike Law, Bryan will NOT crouch slide after the stick is done
correctly (and neither will Bruce, Julia, nor King).  After you
complete the stick motion (make sure you are holding the stick at
the diagonal), press both punch buttons.  If done correctly, Bryan
will throw.  Once you can do Bryan's C.O.M., you should be able to do
Julia's Cross Arm Suplex (or King's DDT).  The motion is the same as
Bryan's C.O.M. except you roll the stick backward instead of forward.

2.1.1. About Julia

Julia is an offensive character who relies on speed, counterhits,
mixups, and juggles to win.  Julia does not have fast power shots
like Paul or Ogre, she does not have many defensive turtle-friendly
moves (i.e., reversals) like Law or Nina, she does not have any special
stances like Lei or Yoshimitsu, she does not have multipart throws
like King or Nina, and she is not very easy to use like Law or Paul.
Why play her?  Aside from pretty looks and sex appeal to male players,
Julia has fast jabs that can lead into damaging combos that launch
if they counterhit, and she has strong juggles that can remove almost
half a life bar from an opponent.  Julia also has nasty mixups that
will frustrate an opponent who cannot defend against them properly.
Julia even has a few powerful and flashy throws, so she can grapple
when necessary.

----------------
2.1.2. Strengths

I will explain briefly on Julia's strengths.

Combos:  This is how Julia inflicts heavy damage, whether the combo
is a canned string guaranteed on counterhit, a high damage juggle,
or a combination of both.  Julia has several strings that are true
combos if the first attack connects as a counterhit (i.e., hit the
opponent during his or her move execution), and these alone often
remove 25-40% life.  Julia is also a very good juggler.  Her strongest
juggles are among the most damaging in the game.  In fact, she is
perhaps THE strongest class 2 juggler in the game with the possible
exception of Jin.  She is even capable of class 3 juggles.

Mixups:  I am not talking about the various canned strings and their
relatives (e.g., Tequila Sunrise) mind you, though they are effective
against beginners and intermediates.  What I really mean is the powerful
options Julia can do after a fast poking move or custom string, and a
mistake on the opponent's part can cost him or her up to half a life bar.
For example, after a blocked elbow, opponent stands and is grabbed by
Julia's Mad Axes.  Later, after another blocked elbow, opponent crouches,
hoping to avoid the throw.  Julia hopkicks instead and it connects.
Julia can then juggle for 45+ more damage.

Sidestep:  Julia has good sidestepping range.  While her sidestep is not
as wide as Law, Lee, or Ogre, she can evade attacks fairly well with her
sidestep alone.  In addition to her sidestep, she also has a special
move that lets her spin to her right side.  When used in conjuction
with her normal sidestep, she can strafe very well, and she can move
behind an attacker quickly.

Speed:  Julia has very fast moves that are useful for poking or
interrupting.  In the Changs' case, speed and combos go hand-in-hand.
Her basic standing left jab or right kick are fast and can start
damaging combos if either counterhit.  Her quick elbows can also
stop many of her opponents' attacks.

Throwing:  Julia has a fair selection of powerful throws.  However,
her Mad Axes makes Julia the semi-grappler that she is.  Any fast
poke can set up Mad Axes; and Mad Axes has damage, speed, and reach.


-----------------
2.1.3. Weaknesses

I will explain briefly on Julia's weaknesses.

Defense:  First, Julia has no high/mid reversal or parry.  While such
a move by itself is not great defense, it does mean that the opponent
can use high/mid attacks without fear of them getting caught, and
is not restricted by either inputting chickens frequently or using
only moves that cannot be parried.  However, the main reason I think
Julia does not have good defense is because she is not a very good
minor counter mistake punisher.  Her best damage dealing moves either
require a major counter or do not have enough reach or speed to
connect during a small opening.  For example, if the opponent whiffs
a jab in front of Julia, Julia can probably hit with an elbow or
something similar, but this results in minor damage.  Compare that
to what Heihachi or Jin can do, who can punish the opponent with an
(E)WGF followed by 35-45 damage juggle, which totals to about half
a life bar.  In short, Julia cannot turtle very well.

Lag:  Many of Julia's moves have long execution and/or recovery time.
Also, some of her sweeps can be low parried on reaction, even more so
if anticipated.

Reach:  Julia's arm and leg reach is relatively short, and the majority
of the Tekken cast have arms and/or legs longer than Julia's.  Although
some of Julia's attacks have good range, her best attacks are most
effective up close to the opponent, within her jab range.  Opponents
who can keep Julia at bay deny her of her most powerful attacks.

Tag Launchers:  Julia has limited tag launchers.  In fact, her only
useful tag launcher, as far as useful tag juggling is concerned, is
her 1~1,1~5 (G-Clef Cannon), which usually requires a counterhit.
Her other tag launchers are too slow, do not launch high enough (unless
her partner is capable of class 3 juggles), or launch the opponent
too far away.  In addition, 1~1,1~5 does not launch heavy opponents
very high.

Compared to the left jab, the right jab has more reach and does more
damage, but it is slower.  If it connects, Julia will have a nice
frame advantage.  In my experience, I found that a throw, especially
Mad Axes, is a great followup to use during the frame advantage.
The right jab is also the start of Julia's (useless) tenstrings.

This is Julia's fastest attack that can hit grounded opponents.  Use

By itself, this sweep has relatively slow execution, and the recovery
is not too good even if it hits (but better than d+3 if blocked).
Still, the sweep is useful and relatively safe because it hits low and
grounded opponents, and since this is the start of Razor's Edge and a
couple other sweep strings, Julia can followup with one of the enders.
After the sweep, Julia recovers crouching.  Also, this sweep recovers
faster than d+3 when used in okizeme.

By itself, the uppercut is useless because it is slow in execution and
recovery.  However, it is the start of several powerful strings Julia
has.  Each Tequila Sunrise string consists of strikes of varying hit
levels and can provide a mean guessing game to the opponent if used
unpredictably.  Also, if the uppercut connects on a counterhit, then
all the hits in the rest of the Tequila Sunrise strings are guaranteed.

Think of this as the WS version of 3.  This is almost useless because
there are better moves that are safer and can inflict more damage

Perhaps the only time this could be of any use is if the time is down

Unlike most characters, Julia does not have a basic juggling uppercut.
Instead, she does a straight punch to the gut.  By itself, this punch
is not very useful because has some execution lag and lousy range, and
the damage is low.  The punch is the start of the Slow Power Punch

In TTT, anyone can low parry by tapping df within 9 frames of impact
from an incoming low attack.  It does not matter if the defender is
crouching or standing.  The universal low parry has no execution
or recovery animation -- your character will automatically parry
the attack if possible.  What the low parry does is catch and push
aside most of your opponents' moves that hit low and the basic low
jabs that hit special mid.  The opponent loses balance for a moment
which gives Julia an attack advantage -- 9 frames after a low punch
parry or 16 frames after a low kick parry.  A few specific attacks,
such as slides, will put the opponent down to the ground if parried.
In the case of a parried low kick, a hop kick can connect, and a hop
kick plus juggle is the most damaging follow up after a low parry.
However, the hop kick is not necessarily guaranteed, because it can
miss.  Whether or not the hop kick can hit depends on how close the
attacker is and the attacker's size.  If you think a hop kick will
miss, you can use other attacks such as the Party Crasher that will
hit for minor damage.  The low parry is very useful because it stops
your opponent's attack, and any guaranteed damage is better than none.

The hop kick is one of Julia's best launchers.  It is moderately fast,
hits mid, and does good damage by itself.  Unfortunately, her hop kick
has bad recovery time, so do not throw it out randomly.  However, if
you see an opening, do not hesitate to use this.  A hop kick plus
juggle can take away close to half of your opponent's life.  Another
good thing about this move is it launches anyone, even heavy
characters, rather high.

Julia does a high jump then does a left side kick that can hit mid or
low depending on when the button is pressed.  If pressed when Julia
starts to descend from the apex of her jump, the kick will hit mid
and cause a double-over stun on a normal hit or a rollback knockdown
on a counterhit.  If pressed while Julia is close to the ground, the
kick hit low and act much like a d+3.  This is a useful and unorthodox
mixup from medium range that is guaranteed to take your opponent by
surprise as long as it is used sparingly.

hold UF then press 4 as soon as Julia jumps.

while others do very little damage (e.g., Mitsus).  This is a stylish
way to tag.  Only use the tag throw if you need to tag and your partner
has a good pounce and is powered up.  (In other words, use it if the
tag pounce will do 30+ damage.)

This is the simplest of Julia's command throws, and it does slightly

(if the sticks are in bad shape) and requires Julia to be crouching.
If you crouch under a high attack and you want to throw, this is the
throw to use.  Also, you can tick with a low jab then try to throw
by buffering this.  After the throw, a d+3 sweep is guaranteed.

This is one of Julia's best launchers against normal-sized opponents,
and it begins with just a simple jab.  Since Julia's jabs come out
fast, use this to interrupt your opponent's attack then juggle him or
her.  Since this string uses only one button, this is also a good panic
button combo to use if you see something nasty coming, such as some
unblockables.  On counterhit, this string combos and does good damage
by itself.  If the last hit is blocked, Julia has some recovery, long
enough to be open to a quick counterattack, which can be bad news
against some opponents (e.g., Heihachi).  This move is not very
effective against heavy characters like the Jacks because it does
not launch them even if the last hit connects unless a tag is buffered,
and even then it does not launch as high.  Overall, the full string is
a risky move but the payoff if it lands makes it worthwhile.  It is
best used to interrupt incoming attacks.  In addition to the full
string, the first two punches alone are useful as pokes.  If you see
that the first two punches are blocked, you can stop at the second
punch, or you can do 1~1,1, 1~1,4, or 1~1,4,3 and hope the opponent
defends incorrectly.  (See 1~1,4,3 below for more details on partial
strings.)

The first two hits are the same as 1~1,1 so players expecting the 1~1,1
may fail the block the bow and arrow kick and take good damage.  If the
4 hits, the 3 is guaranteed if the opponent is close enough.  Like 1~1,1,
if the first jab counterhits, the entire string will combo.  While the
damage is not as high as 1~1,1 plus juggle, the full string is good
to use occasionally.  The low kick is slow enough that experienced
players can block or parry it on reaction, so be careful.  If the
whole string is blocked the recovery is somewhat long, even longer
if the last hit whiffs.  In addition, the size of a few characters
present additional complications.  Ling is small enough that the 3
will miss her unless Julia is very close, and Ganryu is immune to
the bow and arrow kick because the jabs push him too far away.  One
major reason why this and 1~1,1 are useful is because partial strings
are useful pokes.  In this case, you can do 1~1 or 1~1,4; either string
if blocked leaves Julia relatively safe because the opponent will
likely not try to retaliate.  1~1,4 is also useful for setting up
attacks since Julia recovers crouching after the 4.

This combo works only if the first jab strikes as a counterhit.
However, if this lands, the damage from this alone rivals that of
Paul's Phoenix Smasher!  Not only that, but also the last hit launches
and Julia can perform a juggle afterward to drain even more life.
Even heavy characters are launched with ease by this move.  If you
do not get the counterhit, or it does not hit the opponent's front,
all you get is 1~2, and its recovery is slightly worse than 1~1,1.
Nonetheless, it is generally safe because of the threat of 1~2 mixups.
Like the G-Clef strings, this also starts with a simple jab.  Compared
to 1~1, 1~2 is faster and more damaging, but has less range.  If you
are fighting a heavy character or your partner has weak tag class 2
juggles, use this instead of 1~1,1 as your main counterhit weapon.

The last hit of this string strikes low.  Julia also recovers crouching
after it.  This can be useful for sneaking in a low hit once in a while.
Be careful, recovery if it misses or is blocked is relatively long, and
opponents with WS launchers (e.g., Jin or Law) can punish Julia severely.
In addition, the low parry can stop the sweep and open Julia up for free
damage.  Even if your opponent is incapable of powerful FC or WS attacks
and low parry followups, this remains something you cannot abuse (unless
your opponent is a beginner and does not know how to defend against this).
To be honest, the low kick is not very useful because it is relatively
slow and the risk is (generally) too great for such a small gain.

I have mixed feelings about this move.  The kick goes high, so it will
miss an opponent who is waiting for 1~2,3 (as if 1~2,3 was not dangerous
enough to use), and he or she can punish you.  On the other hand, it
can counterhit aggressive opponents trying to get the jump on Julia
after blocking an anticipated 1~2 or failed 1~2~1.  If the right kick
counterhits, the opponent will be in air and open to CH 4 juggles.
Aside from attacking an overaggressive opponent, this may have some
use in juggling for it is easy to do, though the damage is not the best.
Overall, this is probably a little more useful than 1~2,3 because the
danger is about the same, but the rewards are greater.

Julia dashes forward a small distance then strikes with an uppercut.
The dash will go under high attacks.  The uppercut, if it hits,
launches normal-sized characters but only staggers heavy characters
(unless a tag is buffered).  The dash makes its execution time
relatively slow.  Recovery time is slow too.  Nonetheless, it is
a useful move because it can counter predictable players who abuse
effective moves that hit high (such as standing 4).

Julia dashes like in her Flash Uppercut, then lunges forward with a
palm strike.  On a normal hit, the palm knocks down.  On counterhit,
the palm causes a double over stun.  The execution time is too long
to be of any use against a standing opponent, unless he or she tries
to counter after an expected Flash Uppercut.  Recovery is moderate,
and since Julia will likely recover close to her opponent, she will
be open to a fast counterattack.  The palm is somewhat useful in
okizeme as it will hit players who try to roll back while getting
up or tagging out; this move has long range and the dash will keep
up with the rolling opponent and the palm will knock him or her back
down. If the downed opponent is big, the Palm Explosion becomes very
useful as it will hit even if the opponent lays still.

This is one of Julia's bread-and-butter moves.  The elbow itself is
very fast, has good range, and knocks down on any hit.  The elbow
cannot be reversed, but it can be parried.  In addition, the elbow
can be used to juggle an opponent.  The elbow itself does little
damage, but that does not diminish its usefulness and the damage of
multiple elbows, especially in juggles, adds up.  Use it liberally
to interrupt attacks, to retailate after a blocked attack or whiffed
move, to attack reversal-happy players, to setup throws or other pokes,
or to juggle an opponent.  If the stick is in neutral when you start
the elbow, recovery is fast, and it is as fast as Michelle's elbow.
If you hold the stick forward when you start the elbow, the recovery
time will increase considerably, but that will allow you to delay the
skyscraper kick followup as well.  As for the skyscraper kick followup,
I find it useful in two situations:  to end juggles or to stop opponents
trying to counterattack after a blocked elbow.  If the elbow did not
connect but the kick hits, the opponent will be knocked down and Julia
can juggle the opponent.  If the kick is blocked, Julia may be open to
a quick counterattack because the kick has some recovery and Julia will
likely be close to her opponent.

This is another one of Julia's bread-and-butter moves.  The first hit
is a left punch with speed and priority comparable to her left elbow.
If the punch counterhits, the followup right elbow is guaranteed, and
the damage from both hits is quite good.  The elbow is delayable so
if the first punch missed or was blocked, you can either stop then do
some other move (such as the Mad Axes throw), or continue with the
elbow and hope it counterhits.  If the elbow counterhits, the opponent
will be stunned and, if the stun is not escaped, you can launch your
opponent and drain most of his or her life away.  Recovery from both
hits are reasonably fast.  This move is also very useful as a juggle
filler and/or ender.

The spin occurs only after the jab connects.  After the spin, the
opponent will have his/her backturned to Julia.  Since Julia has a
slight disadvantage after the spin, you need to anticipate what your
opponent will do and act accordingly.  It is a guessing game on both
sides.  If you think the opponent will crouch, launch him or her with
a jump kick at the back and juggle.  If you think the opponent will
attack with a move that does not hit mid, crouch then, if the attack
misses, counterattack.  Do not bother with any of the followup links --
your opponent's fastest backturned attacks will beat them out.  In
addition, the opponent also has time to crouch under any of the links.

This looks like 1~2~1 minus the first left jab, but the properties
are different.  The initial punch has short range and executes
relatively slowly, but if it connects the opponent's front on any
hit (no CH needed), the 1 will launch, and you can follow up with
a juggle.  The recovery time is significantly faster than 1~2, so
this is a relatively safe move to use.  If you block a move with
long recovery time and you are standing close to the opponent,
this is a good safe move to punish the opponent with.  Compared
to the hop kick, it is slightly slower, but it is more damaging
and safer in case it is blocked.

This is the same as 1~2,3 minus the left jab, making it a bit slower

Same as the last two hits in 1~2,4.  Since the 4 hits high and
it recovers a bit slower than df+2, not to mention df+2 executes
more slowly than 1~2, this is next to useless in a toe-to-toe fight.
If you just know the opponent will try to attack immediately after
the df+2, the high kick will hit, but that is all it is good for.
This is not even worth doing in juggles, because the damage is low
and Julia has far better moves to juggle with.

This is one of Julia's moves from a crouch.  It has fast execution time
and good range, but slow recovery time.  It knocks down on a normal hit
and stuns on a counterhit.  It has two main uses:  retaliation and
interruption.  If you block a low attack or see an opening while you
are crouching, and you need a fast move with good range, this will
hit for mild damage.  Keep in mind that the Spinning Sweep Combo and
Skyscraper Kick plus followups do more damage.  If you anticipate an
attack, use the elbow to interrupt.  The elbow will likely beat out
your opponent's attack and stun the opponent, and you can follow up
with a damaging combo if the opponent does not break out of the stun.
Overall, it is a powerful attack if you use it at the right times.

Even though this has been toned down since Tekken 3, this is a good
string to use if you have trained your opponent to block low after
the initial uppercut because all three attacks hits mid.  If blocked,
recovery is a bit slow.  If the last hit connects, the opponent will
fall over backwards.  The only guaranteed followup that I know of is
to tag your partner in with a slide (or Ali Kicks with King-based

Though not on the movelist by itself, this deserves special attention.
The first uppercut hits mid, and the low kick hits... well, low.
The low kick is slow enough for people with quick reflexes to block
or parry on reaction.  Depending on your opponent, this string can
either be very effective or very dangerous to you.  If the low kick
hits, any of the three enders is guaranteed.  If the low kick is
blocked, it is a guessing game in Julia's favor -- she can stop here
or add one of three possible enders.  If the low kick is parried,
Julia may be in big trouble.  If Julia stops at the low kick, she
will recover crouching, and she can attack again soon.  Unless your
opponent is adept at parrying the low kick, this can be used as part
of your poking strings.  Remember though, if the low kick hits, any
of the three enders is guaranteed.

This is the most risky yet most devastating of the Slash Uppercut
strings.  The 4 hits low, and if it connects, the 1 is guaranteed,

This is similar to the above string except for the high kick at the
end, and it is almost useless.  It recovers more slowly than the
uppercut, although at least it will not put Julia into her opponent's
face, but then again it may not matter.  In addition, the high kick
does not launch, so the damage is not as good as the uppercut followed
by a juggle.  If your opponent manages to block the low kick after the
WS+2 uppercut, you can stop the string, use the low kick ender if you
think the opponent will block high, or go for broke and use the uppercut
if you think the oppoent will block low.

This is similar to the above two strings except for the low kick at

first sweep is blocked, chances are your opponent will eat the last
sweep rather than risk getting launched by the uppercut ender.  In
addition, Julia recovers crouching after the last sweep.  While the
damage and recovery are not that great, this is generally safer.
If the last sweep is blocked, Julia is vulnerable to quick moves,
even though the lag is less than the other two enders.

This is Julia's sole sidestep move.  It has decent speed and range,
and it does moderate damage.  The move has better range if Julia
sidesteps to her left instead of right.  If blocked, the opponent
is pushed away with no chance of retaliation.  If it whiffs, watch
out!  This is a solid punishment move if you see an opening after
a sidestep.  Aside from bad lag if this move misses, this is a
good move to throw out occasionally while you are on the offense
(because your opponent may flinch and eat the punch).  Just make
sure the punch hits before you use it.

This move has good range, does good damage, and causes block stun if

The move knocks down on a normal hit.  On counterhit, the opponent is
knocked back far spinning head over heels, and you can run after your
opponent.  The only downside of this move is that it has relatively
slow execution time.  This is really a useful move from a distance.
It can catch opponents who whiff moves from a short distance for
decent damage, and it can hit opponents who sidestep a small distance
(e.g., Paul's SS, Lei's stance changing).  Also, the block stun
from this move can give Julia the time to close on the opponent.

This is another power shot similar to Twin Arrow.  Compared to Twin
Arrow, this is slightly faster and more damaging, but the range is
less.  On counterhit, this move also launches.  If a tag is buffered,
the tag will occur on any hit.  If blocked, the opponent is pushed
back, leaving Julia safe from retailation.  If it misses, Julia is
highly vulnerable.  I am not sure, but this may go under some high
attacks at times as well.  One warning though, this is NOT a substitute
for Twin Arrow.  It does not have quite enough range to be effective
as a medium-range staple attack, especially against defensive
opponents.  Whiff, and you die, at least against competent opponents
using characters with powerful moves like WGF or deathfist.  Also,
if the opponent blocks Shove It Up, Julia will lose any momentum she
had going, even though she is safe.  This is mainly a counterhit
attack.  Throw it out when you think your opponent might walk into it;
you may get a lucky hit, possibly CH.

include long execution and recovery time.  If blocked, Julia will
stagger and be wide open to nasty things.  However, if used sparingly
or during an opponent's attack, the sweep will be an asset because of
the potential juggle damage if it counterhits or the ensuing guessing
game if it just hits normally.  Unless the sweep is blocked, Julia

These are the first two hits of Julia's Spinning Kicks series.  While
the Spinning Kicks by itself is not in the movelist, it is one of
Julia's more useful moves.  The first kick goes high and the second
kick low.  Both kicks are relatively fast, and the second kick
recovers quickly, which makes this move a good poke.  The kicks
have fairly good range, and they move Julia forward a bit.  The
low kick will also stop opponents who try to sidestep around Julia.
One other very useful property about this move is Julia recovers
crouching after the low kick, which means Julia can start her FC
or WS mixups from the crouch.  This move is very good, but it has
one weaknesses -- the low parry.  Now that everyone has it, any
player who sees the kicks coming can parry the low kick then punish
Julia during her recovery.

This string executes quickly, but the uppercut ender has poor recovery.
Against a standing opponent, the uppercut will launch if it connects,
but unless you are sure the uppercut will hit (e.g., opponent expects
4,4,d+4; opponent attacks and gets countered by the first 4), do not
use this because you will be punished.  This string does have use in
combos.  If the first 4 counterhits, it will knockdown the opponent,
and the uppercut is guaranteed.  Also, if you are behind your opponent
and close enough for a back throw to connect, all three hits can combo,
but the uppercut may miss smaller characters because the kicks knock
the opponent forward.  If you manage to launch, you can follow up with
a juggle for major damage.  In addition, this by itself is also a
damaging juggle.

This string is fast and it is great for chipping away your opponent's
life bar.  Julia also recovers crouching, which means she can use FC or

This is THE juggle finisher for Julia.  As a juggle finisher, these
three hits do solid damage.  If you are opting for damage, this is
often the most effective choice.  Note that you usually must delay
the third hit as long as possible so that it connects in the juggle.
As a stand alone attack outside of a juggle, it executes and recovers
relatively quickly (though be wary of sidestepping opponents because
the Mountain Crusher will not track), and each hit is delayable,
giving you many options.  If the first strike counterhits, the second
is guaranteed, but the third is not.  If the second strike counterhits,
the last hit is guaranteed.  The final hit pushes the opponent away if
it is blocked or knocks down if it hits.  In any event, a counterhit
at any part of the string does good damage.  One note:  even though
the third hit looks like an elbow of sorts, it CAN be reversed.
Therefore, do not forget to input chickens if your opponent has
a reversal.

This is like 4,4,1 without the first high kick.  The sweep comes out
slowly.  The uppercut is not guaranteed even if the sweep counterhits.
Do not use this on a standing opponent unless you are sure you opponent
will not or cannot block it, because its slow recovery will allow your
opponent to punish you hard.  In juggles, this is actually a very good
ender, and it is easy to do.  This move can also be handy in okizeme
if you can catch your opponent trying to get up as it will knock him

This move is dangerous to use.  First, the kick has no range -- even
her jabs and Mad Axes throw have more range.  Second, the kick is not
fast enough to beat out most moves effective in such close range.
Third, the kick hits high.  The combination of these faults make
this move easy to whiff, and easy for Julia to suffer.  Its saving
grace is if the kick counterhits, the opponent will crumple during
an inescapable stun, allowing an opportunity for a juggle.  Use it
when you anticipate a slow move coming (e.g., Jacks' 1,1,1) and/or
as a surprise move.  One note:  I have found this kick to be effective
in stopping the back spring recovery (i.e., ~f after landing FU/FT)
from characters of at least average size (i.e., Jin or others of
similar size or bigger) if timed correctly, and since the kick
will counterhit in this case, the opponent will be stunned.

This is another very useful move Julia has, and it is done from a
crouch.  The sweep seems to come out quickly and if it hits, the
followup kick is guaranteed to hit if Julia is close enough to the
opponent.  The total damage from both hits is quite good.  The only
weaknesses of this move is recovery time and it is prone to miss Ling
unless Julia is very deep when the sweep hits.  However, do not let
that stop you from using this move when you see an opening.  If at
anytime you are crouching and close to your opponent, and your
opponent is standing, do this for some easy damage.  If you are not
close enough such that the second kick may not hit, or the opponent
might crouch in time to block low, just do the first sweep only;
Julia will recover crouching quickly enough.  (Actually, she is
vulnerable, but the opponent will often wait for the second kick
so chances are that Julia will not get hit.)  This move is also very
useful in juggles and okizeme.  In juggles, this can be followed up
by a Mountain Crusher for serious damage.  Also, if you hit a
grounded opponent with this while he/she tries to get up, you can
followup with a juggle.

This move is not useless, but the times when it is useful are uncommon.
Since Julia jumps high into the air before coming down with a painful
stomp, the move is slow.  If the stomp misses or is blocked, Julia will
be wide open to all sorts of punishment.  The stomp has a strange hit
area against a standing opponent -- it hits if it touches the opponent's
head or back.  The most useful application of the stomp is in combos.
The stomp is guaranteed to hit after any of her double-over stun
inducing moves (provided the opponent does not break out of the stun),
some special tag throws, and some launchers that do not allow
techrolling.  The stomp is also useful in hitting your opponent
out of a dangerous stance from mid range.  For example, Lei's
drunken stance or play dead tricks, Ling's Art of the Phoenix,
Eddy's handstands, or Kuma's Hunting Bear.

This is like 1~1,1 minus the first high jab.  Since it comes out more
slowly, it is not as useful as 1~1,1, and it should not be relied upon
for interrupting purposes.  However, if your opponent expects the Bow

The first two hits are nothing special.  Execution time of the last
hit is far too slow.  Your opponent has time to sidestep around Julia
(even big characters like Jack can sidestep twice easily and throw
Julia from behind), hit Julia out of the dash before the uppercut
hits (though the dash will go under high attacks), or at the very
least block.  If for some reason the uppercut connects, it will
launch normal-sized characters and you can juggle, but do not count
on that happening.  In short, stay away from this move.

This is Julia's taunt.  It cannot hit unlike some of the other taunts
(such as Bryan's knee taunt or Ling's waving taunt).  The taunt can be
cancelled at anytime by another move.  Careless or impatient players
may drop their guard (and carelessly rush in for an attack) while Julia
is waving her hand, giving you an opening you can take advantage of.

This unblockable has good range, but it is too slow to be of much use
since an alert player has time to either back away to safety or rush
in and interrupt it.  However, Julia will dash under high attacks
once she starts moving.  If this connects, the opponent will suffer
heavy damage and be launched very high, and you can follow up with a
class 1 juggle for even more damage.  This unblockable hits mid and
can hit grounded big characters.  This move is lethal to big characters
because they are especially vulnerable to it in some circumstances.
Comments on the unblockable's tracking ability:  Until Julia starts
dashing, the unblockable can track the opponent like many other
unblockables.  The dash is linear.  However, Julia can reorient
herself to face the opponent after she stops dashing.  Her
reorientation gives the unblockable a bit more reach toward the
opponent's general direction, which may be enough to connect an
opponent who would have otherwise sidestepped the unblockable.

This is Julia's special low parry from Tekken 3.  Compared to the
universal low parry, this has a longer capture window of 12 frames,
making it easier to low parry.  There are execution and recovery
(miss) animations for this low parry, but the lag is minimal.  The
frame advantages from low attacks parried by this special low parry
are one frame less than those from the universal low parry.  (i.e.,
8 frames for low punch, 15 for low kick, or knockdown on some moves.)
Because of the longer capture window and no use of diagonals, this
is a great alternative to the universal low parry.

Julia pauses for a moment (55 frames to be exact) and yells while
she gathers energy.  Once charged, Julia's hands will glow.  The
supercharger lasts two seconds.  While the charge lasts, any hit
is treated as a counterhit, and any blocked attack will do guard
damage.  However, Julia is unable to block and any hit she takes
is also treated as a counterhit.

The first six hits in each of Julia's tenstrings are the same.  The
fifth hit can be low parried.  The sixth hit goes high, so it can be
easily interrupted then.  Even though there is a possible mixup on
the eighth hit, it is followed by a break point so the last two hits
are not guaranteed even if the eighth hit connects, so the last two
hits are easily blocked.  Julia's tenstrings are only effective against
novice players who do not know how to defend against them and are
useless against anyone else.


//---------------//
//  2.4. Combos  //
//---------------//

Below is a list of combos that Julia can use.  There are far too many
combos to list them all, so I have listed the more noteworthy ones --
namely the more popular combos and a few variants.  The combos are
separated by combo starters.  The most common starter is the launcher,
but combos can also be started by a stun, a trip, or even a knockdown
move that does not allow the opponent to tech roll.  Unless specified
otherwise, all the listed combos assume that the opponent is facing
toward Julia.

While the opponent is helpless in the air, any hits in the juggle do
less than full damage.  The first hit in the juggle does 80% damage,
while all successive hits do 50% damage.  Note that hits in a combo
on an opponent standing on the ground do full damage.  Each combo
listed has an approximate damage value next to it, based on the
damage formula.  I have done the damage calculations by hand (since
I do not have a PSX), so the damage values in some juggles may be off
by a point or two due to rounding.

One of the implications from the mid-air damage rules is that some
juggles that involve jabs before a high damage move can do less
damage than juggles that use the same power move alone.  For example,
Paul's QCF+2 alone does more damage than 1, QCF+2.  Since few of
Julia best combos use power moves, and even those are used in
unusual circumstances, Julia is not affected by this much.

Note:  Due to the changes to Julia since Tekken 3, some of the combos
that worked in Tekken 3 do not work anymore in TTT and vice versa.
In TTT, Julia's has the new Mountain Crusher and the recovery from
her Party Crasher is much faster.  These two new additions to Julia
have given her easier and/or stronger new combos.  However, her
Rapid Counter (d,DF+1,2) in juggles has been toned down in TTT.
In Tekken 3, the Party Crasher was possible after the second hit.
Now, the Rapid Counter pushes the opponent too far away, ending the
juggle.

<normal>
These juggles are possible after class 3 tag launchers or better,
and all of them begin with the Party Crasher.  Due to their ease
of use and versatility, they are Julia's staple combos.

* f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1
Julia can repeat elbows until the opponent is pushed too far away to be
hit by anything else.  Up to five elbows can connect, maybe six if the
elbows are dash buffered.  If the opponent is big, six elbows can be
done more easily.

* f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
If you want an elbow juggle that is simple, reliable, and reasonably
damaging, this is the one to use.

* f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
This elbow juggle does slightly more damage than the above combos.
It is relatively easy to do, especially if you dash buffer the elbows.
If you want to up the difficulty and add an extra five points of damage,
you can add a fifth elbow (before the skyscraper kick of course).  For
five elbows, you must dash buffer every elbow.

* f,f,N+1, df+4,2,b<f+1
The damage from this elbow juggle is very good, and it is relatively
easy to do if you are close enough to the opponent after the Party
Crasher elbow.  The last hit of the Mountain Crusher must be delayed
for a moment for it to connect.

* f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
This is somewhat more difficult due to the d,DF motion.  Nonetheless,
if you can do the Rapid Counter Attack in a pinch, this is the most
damaging elbow juggle Julia can do.

* f,f,N+1, d,DF+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
* f,f,N+1, d,DF+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
These are slightly more damaging variants of the above juggles.
The Rapid Counter Attack can substitute one of the elbows for more
damage.

NOTE:  From here on, the above juggles and their variants will be
refered to as "elbow juggles".

<untechable>
These are juggles Julia can do after a (low) tag launcher that does not
allow the opponent to techroll.  Examples of such launchers include
Bryan's b+1 on normal hit or Paul's FC,DF+2,2.  The juggles below do
not inflict as much damage as the above elbow juggles, but they are
easier to do because the sweep will hit grounded opponents and bounce
them into the air for the followup hit.

* d+4,1
Razor's Edge is easy to do and puts Julia closer to the opponent.

* d+4,N+4
This does slightly more damage than Razor's Edge.

-----------------

<normal>
These are juggles that can be used after most class 2 tag launchers.
Many juggles listed here are slightly more damaging variations of
the basic class 3 elbow juggles.  For juggles that start with d+2,
you can start with the easier and faster (but less damaging) d+1
instead if necessary.  Comments on the following juggles:

* 3
This is dead simple and easy.  However, Julia's 3 is not as damaging
as some of the other characters' standing 3 or 4, and the damage is
low compared to Julia's better juggles.  Also, this does not work
with every class 2 launcher.

* df+4,2,b<f+1
The Mountain Crusher alone is an easy solid juggle that does good
damage.  Usually, the last hit must be delayed.

* 4,4,1
This is a simple but damaging juggle.  This is easy to connect on
big opponents, but it is much harder to connect on smaller opponents.
It can hit anyone though.  The key is to hit the opponent with the
high kick as low as possible, so the low kick hits.

* 4,4,4
This is more damaging and masher-friendly than 4,4,1, but it is
even tougher to connect on normal-sized opponents since the third
kick does not have as much reach as the uppercut.  Otherwise,
comments from 4,4,1 apply here too.

* d+2, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
* d+2, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
* d+2, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
A low jab can substitute the first Party Crasher in most of the
class 3 elbow juggles.  At best, the damage is the same.  Because
Julia recovers crouching after the low jab, she cannot use the
Mountain Crusher.

* df+4, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
* df+4, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
* df+4, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
Here is another set of elbow juggle variants.

* F+2, d,DF+1,2
This is mentioned because it was useful to Julia in Tekken 3 since
she could add f,f+1,4 after the Rapid Counter.  Now, the right elbow
pushes the opponent too far away.

* F+2, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
* F+2, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
* F+2, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
As with the low jab, a high jab can substitute the first Party Crasher
in the class 3 elbow juggles.  Although her left jab can do, her right
jab is better because it has more reach and does more damage, yet it
recovers quickly enough.  Note:  If you do 2 instead of F+2, you will
rob yourself about 3 points of damage (since 2 does 8 damage while
F+2 does 12 damage).

* 1~2,4
This is relatively easy to do since no stick motions are involved.
However, damage is relatively low.  (I have read that a Party Crasher
can be done after this in Tekken 3, but I have not been able to do
that in TTT.)

* 1~2, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
* 1~2, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
The initial 1~2 acts much like the first two elbows in other juggles.
Otherwise, no other comments.

* b+4, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
* b+4, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
* b+4, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
Elbow juggles after the Heaven Shatter Kick are more damaging, but
much harder to do.  To connect, the Heaven Shatter Kick requires
a class 1 or high class 2 launcher, then the elbow must be done
immediately after recovery from the kick.  Julia has a hard time
doing these juggles on her own because none of Julia's launchers
launch high enough except her unblockable (class 1) or counterhit
hop kick (high class 2).  If you want to do one of these juggles,
I recommend you pick someone with a good high class 2 tag launcher
(e.g., Bryan's WS+1 or Law's WS+2) and tag in Julia after it connects.

* d+2, FC,df+4,3
The damage this juggle inflicts is relatively low.  However, more
hits are possible after the Sweeping Sweep Combo if you are fast
enough.  In Julia's case, the Mountain Crusher is one of the most
powerful extensions after this combo.

* d+2, FC,df+4,3, f,f,N+1,4
This was one of Julia's better (and riskier) juggles from Tekken 3.
Now in TTT, it is overshadowed by better juggles.  It still does good
damage.  However, you need to be fast after the Spinning Sweep combo
to connect with the Party Crasher or else the opponent can tech roll
to safety and end up behind you.  This juggle is a bit too risky for
my tastes because if you are too slow and miss the Party Crasher,
your opponent can tech roll and get a free attack on you.

* d+2, FC,df+4,3, f,f,N+1, f,F,N+1,4
Julia's Party Crasher has faster recovery in TTT, so she can add more
hits after it.  In this case, she can add another elbow.  This second
elbow must be dash-buffered so that the skyscraper kick can connect.

* d+2, FC,df+4,3, df+4,2,b<f+1
This is Julia best juggle overall.  It is one of her most damaging
juggles, and it is not too difficult to do once you get the timing
down.  The last hit of the Mountain Crusher must be delayed as long
as possible for it to hit.  Master this juggle!

<untechable>
Below is another juggle that can be used after Bryan's CH b+1 or King's
CH f,N,d,DF+1+2.  Those launchers not only bounce high enough for a
class 2 juggle, but also the opponent cannot tech roll after landing.

* uf+3+4
If the opponent cannot tech roll, the Foot Stomp is guaranteed to hit.
Although this is not as damaging as Julia's best class 2 juggle, the
Foot Stomp does good damage, and it is much easier to do, not to mention
that it looks painful and stylish.

<cross-up>
Below is a juggle that involves Julia attacking with a move that goes
under an airborne opponent and hits the opponent in the back, then Julia
and the opponent end up back-to-back because of the attack's momentum.
(This is similar to SF2's Ryu or Ken jumping over the likes of
M.Bison/Vega and hitting them at the back of the head with a jumping
roundhouse.)

* f,f,N+1, BK 3_4 (class 1 or tag class 2 only)
If Julia is too close to the opponent when you try to juggle with the
Party Crasher, and the opponent is just above Julia's head, Julia will
dash underneath her opponent, hit him/her in the back, and Julia will
end up backturned (BK).  After that, her best option is a simple
backturned kick.  Damage is relatively low (I am assuming her BK kicks
do 25 damage normally), and not as high as her normal class 3 elbow
juggles.

Below are juggles that can be used after any class 1 tag launcher.
Most of the following juggles begin with the high jump kick, which
is one of Julia's harder hitting moves.  Comments:

Take a class 3 elbow juggle, replace the first elbow with a jump kick,
and... you get the idea.  The jump kick hits much harder than an elbow
so that damage is excellent.

* F+1+4 (big; not a true combo)
This only works on big characters and even then it is technically not
a true combo because the opponent can tech roll after landing.  However,
the unblockable is difficult if not impossible to avoid since Julia
is already dashing by then and her unblockable will track the opponent.
Because this is so effective, this is probably the best followup against
big opponents after a class 1 launcher due to the ease of use and damage.

<untechable>
Below is another juggle that can be used after Devil's Devil Twister,
Jack-2's Discharger, or P.Jack's Drill Upper.  All of these launchers
are class 1 and the opponent cannot tech roll after landing.

If you are fighting a big opponent, this is the best followup for two
reasons:  it does great damage and it is very easy to do.  Enough said.

-----------------

Julia has several moves that will cause a double-over stun.  Assuming
the opponent does not escape the stun, Julia has many juggles to choose
from.  The first hit of the combo should connect while the opponent is
starting to fall back, so the opponent will be in the air after the
attack hits.

* 1+2
* f+1+2
These are very easy to do, but the damage is not the best.
Julia can do better.

* uf+3+4 (not a true combo)
Even though this is technically not a true combo, the opponent cannot
roll away in time to avoid it if the Foot Stomp is done quickly enough.
This is relatively easy to do, and the damage is good.  Be careful if
your opponent can break out of the stun, since you must execute the
Foot Stomp immediately and hope your opponent does not break out of
the stun.  If the stun is broken, your opponent will have more than
enough time to punish Julia once she lands.

* d,DF+1,2
This is relatively easy to do, but you are better off juggling with
one of combos below if you insist on starting a juggle with d,DF+1.
In Tekken 3, Julia could followup with a Party Crasher after this,
but not anymore.

* d,DF+1, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
* d,DF+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4

The Rapid Counter Attack can substitue the first elbow in the Party

are much the same as the standard multi-elbow juggles.

merely staggers them.  The first hit of the combo will knock the
stunned opponent into the air for full damage, and the rest of the
hits will juggle.

The only move Julia has that will cause block stun long enough such
that an attack can hit is the generic cross chop while running or
tagging in, and the cross chop needs to hit as late as possible.
Against heavy opponents, some of Julia's launchers, most notably 1~1,1
and f+1, do not launch (unless a tag was buffered) if the launcher
connects.  Instead, the opponent is knocked off balance for a moment.
If a followup attack connects before the opponent recovers fully, the
opponent will be knocked into the air and can be juggled.  While the
opponent is recovering, he cannot neutral guard attacks.  I do not
know if the opponent can active block attacks (i.e., hold back)
while recovering.

-----------------

Against normal-sized opponents, these launchers will launch to class 2
height.  However, Julia is often too far away to connect with a left
jab or low jab, so she has fewer reliable juggles.

Against a heavier opponent, these launchers will only stagger the
opponent most of the time, and the above juggles will not work.
However, if you are close and fast enough, a jab might hit the
opponent before he recovers from the stagger and knock him off
his feet.  If you manage to do this, you can juggle.

-----------------

Julia's basic standing right kick knocks the opponent away on a
counterhit.  While the opponent is in the air, Julia can connect
with a Party Crasher or Rapid Counter Attack.  Comments:

* d,DF+1,2
If you can do this in a pinch, this is the most reliable juggle.
Damage is not as good as an elbow juggle though.

* d,DF+1, f,f,N+1,4
* d,DF+1, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
These do more damage than d,DF+1,2 -- if you connect.  (Personally,
I find these tougher to do than those that start with the elbow
because the punch has longer recovery than the elbow.)

* f,F,N+1, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
* f,F,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
* f,F,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
Julia can do nearly any of her elbow juggles after a CH 4.  To connect
with the first elbow, you need to input the elbow quickly as soon as
Julia recovers, and the elbow needs to be dash buffered.  In addition,
the stick must be neutral before you press 1.

-----------------

After a counterhit Machine Gun Cannon or Slow Power Punch Combo,
the opponent is popped up high and away.  After Julia recovers,
she will need to run forward to juggle her opponent.  Comments:

* f,F+1,4
* f,F,N+1, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
* f,F,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
* f,F,N+1, df+4,2,b<f+1
* f,F,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
These are similar to the standard elbow juggles.  To connect with the
first elbow, tap forward twice and hold forward after the second tap
for a brief moment to dash buffer the elbow.  If you want to do more
moves after the elbow (highly recommended), quickly move the stick to
neutral then press 1 to do the elbow.  While running, if you wait too
long to start the first elbow, you will do a Rapid Counter Attack
instead, which will miss because it do not hit as low as the elbow.

* f,f,f+1,2
* f,f,f+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
* f,f,f+1, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
* f,f,f+1, df+4<2,b<f+1
* f,f,f+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
Aside from the initial Rapid Counter Attack, these are similar to the
above elbow juggles.  You will need to tap forward three times fast as
soon as Julia recovers to start running then press 1 to do the Rapid
Counter Attack.  Compared to the above, these are harder but more
damaging.  (The recovery lag after f,f,f+1 always messes up my attempts
for extra hits.)

NOTE:  In this case, Mountain Crusher is difficult to connect after
either f,F,N+1 or f,f,f+1.  Unless you want to show off (or you can
do it consistently), I do not recommend it.

Julia's Shove It Up launches the opponent up and away on a counterhit.
She can either run after the opponent and use elbow juggles, or high
jump and use high jump kick juggles.  Comments:

* UF,4, f,f,N+1,4
This is the easiest juggle, but it is not very easy to connect with
the Party Crasher.  Damage is good.

* UF,4, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
This is the most useful juggle after a CH f+1+2.  Compared to the
above juggle, the difficulty is about the same, but this juggle does
more damage.

* UF,4, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
This is a juggle found in one of Castel's movies.  It is tough to do,
but it does excellent damage if the whole juggle connects.

These moves can put the opponent into a double-over stun.  Assuming

choose from.  In the case of UF,N,3, Julia may need to approach the
opponent quickly before she can do some of the juggles.

-----------------

The second hit from the Rapid Counter Attack Lightning Bolt will cause
a double over stun on a counterhit, and Julia can do any of the double
over stun combos she has.  Also, since Julia recovers faster than her
other stun inducing moves, she can throw or do other combos such as a
launcher plus juggle.  A launcher plus juggle Julia's most devastating
option after stunning the opponent with the elbow from this move.

-----------------

If you manage to counterhit with Julia's Heaven Shatter Kick, the
opponent will be caught in an inescapable stun.  Since Julia will
be slightly off axis, some of her juggles will not work.  As far
as I know, any of her class 3 juggles, most of which are elbow
juggles, or the Mountain Crusher work nicely.  Comments:

* df+4,2,b<f+1
This is simple but damaging; enough said.

* SSR, FC,df+4,3, df+4,2,b<f+1
After the sidestep, the Spinning Sweep Combo will lift the opponent
off the ground and flip him or her over.  Otherwise, this is similar
to her class 2 Spinning Sweep Combo juggles.

* SSL, d+1, FC,df+4,3, df+4,2,b<f+1
This is a variant of the above juggle.  Julia needs to sidestep to her
left first so she will be lined up with her opponent.  The low jab can
hit only big characters; it is miss anyone who is smaller.

-----------------

These sweeps will trip the opponent, and the opponent will float in
the air just long enough for a juggle to connect.  After Julia does
one of these sweeps, she recovers crouching.

* f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d+4,1
* f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1,4
* f,f,N+1, df+4,2,b<f+1
* f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2
These are the same standard elbow juggles.

* [FC+1_FC+2_FC+4,] FC,df+4,3, f,f,N+1,4
* [FC+1_FC+2_FC+4,] FC,df+4,3, df+4,2,b<f+1
Because Julia recovers crouching, she can easily start a Spinning
Sweep Combo juggle immediately.  The low jab or low kick before the
Spinning Sweep Combo is not needed, but it adds a little extra damage
and may lift the opponent a bit higher.  Since the opponent is not in
the air as high, it is tougher to connect with any followup before the
opponent touches the ground (and can techroll).  If you are too slow
in your followup, and the opponent hits the ground and tech rolls,
Julia will almost certainly be open to an attack, especially a back
throw in the case of a missed Mountain Crusher.  If you think an attack
after the Spinning Sweep Combo is too risky, you can stop the juggle
after the Spinning Sweep Combo then harass the opponent with okizeme.

Some comments about her basic face down tripping sweep:
Julia can try the tripping sweep anytime she is lying on the ground face
down.  If the 3 connects on a clean hit or counterhit, Julia's opponent
will be tripped and can be juggled.  Julia has no moves, aside from her
running jump kick (RN+3), that can get her laying on the ground, which
usually means she has to be knocked down to the ground by her opponent.
If Julia is facing up while on the ground, press D+1 and hold down so
Julia will lay face down after rolling.

-----------------

After the Skyscraper Kick connects, the opponent will be knocked down
to ground and cannot quick recover.  While the opponent is down, Julia
has few guaranteed followups that will add a little more damage.  If
the opponent is big, you can use Party Crasher or Mountain Crusher
juggles instead because they will hit them.  If you know the opponent
will try to get up immediately, you can wait a moment then use the
big men juggles (if the opponent is not big).  Comments:

* d+3
This is the fastest and easiest followup.  It also does slightly more
damage than the d+4 sweep alone.

* d+4,1 (not a true combo)
This is a bit slower, but the sweep is guaranteed to hit.  If the
opponent tries to get up when the sweep hits, the uppercut will hit
as well.  The uppercut also advances Julia toward the opponent, which
is good if it hits, but bad if it misses.

* d+4,N+4 (not a true combo)
This is nearly the same as Razor's Edge.  The only difference is the
last hit is a right kick instead of an uppercut.  The right kick does
slightly more damage than the uppercut, and it does not advance Julia
much so it is safe to use in case the opponent stays down.  The only
problem with this is I find it easy to do a low kick (d+4,d+4) instead
during the heat of battle, which will miss unless the opponent is big,
and even if it hits, the low kick does less damage.

* df+4<2,b<f+1 (big)
Mountain Crusher will lift big guys off the ground and inflict good
damage.  This will miss smaller characters.

* f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, f,f,N+1, d,DF+1,2 (big)
Same as the standard elbow juggles.  In this case, only big characters
can be hit by the elbow -- it will miss smaller characters.

-----------------

The Skyscraper Kick after the Party Crasher recovers somewhat faster
than the stand-alone Skyscraper Kick.  Because of this, elbow juggles
and Mountain Crusher can work on anyone.  I recommend the Mountain
Crusher because it will juggle anyone easily enough for good damage.
Unless the character is big, the elbow juggles will require precision
timing to connect.  Alternatively, you can use df+4 to lift the opponent
off the ground then use an elbow juggle.


-----------------
2.4.2. Tag Combos

Tag juggles are useful because they do more damage to the red life bar,
leaving the opponent less life to regenerate.  Anytime you connect with
a tag launcher, and your partner can juggle well after it, tag out and
let your partner finish the juggle.

-----------------

After a Tequlia Sunrise Combo, the opponent staggers back a few steps
before falling down.  Julia cannot followup with anything guaranteed
by herself, so her only juggle option is to tag out and let her
partner finish the combo.  The only followups that can hit are
either a tag slide or Ali Kicks.

* f,f,N+4
For most characters, this will do a tag slide.  Damage from the slide
may not be very much, but it is better than nothing.  A few characters
will do something other than a slide, which may or may not hit.

* f,f,N+4,4,4 (Alex/Roger, Armor King, or King only)
If Julia's partner is Alex/Roger, Armor King, or King; they will
do Ali Kicks instead.  This does more damage than a tag slide.

Against normal-sized opponents, these are Julia's class 2 tag launchers.
If the opponent is heavy, these become class 3 tag launchers.  The
G-Clef Cannon is Julia best tag launcher.  In fact, it is her only
reliable tag launcher.  Her Ultimate Cannon can tag launch, but it
is so slow that using it will only get Julia killed.  After the tag,
Julia's partner can finish off the launcher with a juggle.

These tag launchers put the opponent up and away, and Julia can juggle

does less damage, but it is easier to combo with.

This is a taggable special throw done by Julia's partner followed by

enough for Julia to literally stomp her opponent once she tags in.

* uf+3+4
Ouch -- this hurts!  The total damage from the throw and stomp is
very good.

* d+3
This is safe, fast, and easy, but it is nowhere near as damaging as
the Foot Stomp.  If the diagonals are bad, you may be stuck with this.

* f,f,N+4
The tag slide will hit, and it is more damaging than a d+3, but the
opponent might be able to get up with a sweep and hit Julia before
she recovers -- not good.

-----------------

After Wang tags out from the Waning Moon, the opponent may be low
to the ground and can recover crouching.  Most of Julia's best attacks
are either too slow or will miss the opponent, so Julia does not have
much to attack the opponent with.

* d+3
This is the easiest followup, but the damage is low.

* f,f,N+4
This is probably the best guaranteed move Julia can do.  After the
slide, Julia can get up with a 3 sweep (which is not guaranteed).

* f,f,N+1+2 (blocked), <any block stun combo>
This is tougher to do, but the damage is good -- better than the above
options.  Either the cross chop will hit the opponent for good damage,
or the opponent will block it, then be open to a possible juggle for
even more damage because of block stun.  While the opponent staggers,
you can juggle the opponent with any block stun combo.


//-------------------//
//  2.5. Strategies  //
//-------------------//

--------------
2.5.1. Defense

Julia does not have any reversals or any high/mid parries so against
high/mid attacks, she will need to block, sidestep, or interrupt them.
Fortunately for Julia, her sidestep has good range, and she has
lightning fast attacks like G-Clef Cannon or Party Crasher to stop
incoming attacks.  Interrupting attacks is Julia's best defense anyway.
Julia can take away about a third or even half of a life bar with
combos that start with an 8 frame jab that counterhits.  If you think
about it, that is a great advantage.

Julia does have the low parry from Tekken 3, which can be done at
anytime, and it makes parrying low attacks easier.  Julia also has
the universal low parry, so you can use either parry to stop low
attacks.  If you see a low attack coming, you should parry it *IF*
by doing so it gives you the best advantage.  What I mean by that
is sometimes it is better to parry while other times it is better
to simply block (or dodge) then counter later.

Examples when low parry is the best option.
* Another Julia is using the Tequila Sunrise Low Kick strings
  (WS+2,4,...).  If you low parry the sweep, you not only have
  a big enough opening to start a combo, but also you prevented
  a nasty mixup.

* King is abusing Ali Kicks.  If you block them all, King is open
  to a quick counterattack (such as the Skyscraper Kick).  If you
  parry the Ali Kicks, King is open to a high damage hop kick combo.

* Bruce attacks with 3,2,1,4.  The 4 hits low.  If you block the
  string, Bruce is safe.  Low parry the 4 and Bruce is vulnerable.
  Although Julia's hop kick will more than likely miss Bruce in
  this case, a df+4 or f,f+1 elbow can hit for minor damage.
  Any damage is better than none.

Examples when low parry is NOT the best option.
* Gun Jack is attacking with a Double CutSaw (f+1+2,1+2).  The last hit
  is a low punch.  If you low parry it, Jack will be open only for a
  moment, and Julia's launchers are too slow to hit him during the
  opening.  If you block the low punch, Gun Jack is open long enough
  for an easy Skyscraper Kick.  Since Gun Jack is big, you can juggle
  him with the Party Crasher after the knockdown.

* You are fighting Jun, and you know the player will use Can Can Kicks.
  The first hit is low, and the second hit is high.  If you low parry
  the first kick, Jun will be vulnerable, but a hop kick will miss her,
  and you are limited to fast but weak moves that cannot start combos.
  If you block the low kick, the second kick will pass over Julia's
  head and Jun is wide open to many things (e.g., hop kick) while she
  is recovering.

Examples when low parry may or may not be the best option.
* You see a Paul player use the 1232121421 tenstring against you.
  The eighth hit is low.  You can parry it then followup with a
  launcher followed by a juggle, or you can block it and the ninth
  hit, then interrupt the tenth hit before it comes out with a
  counterhit 1~1,1 or 1~2~1 followed by a (tag) juggle.  Damage
  is high either way.

Below is a list of low kick attacks that if parried put the opponent
too far away to be hit by the Changs' hop kick.  In such cases, a
Party Crasher or some other swift mid attack must be used instead
if you want to inflict damage after a successful low parry.

Bruce:   3,2,1,4
Eddy:    any low attack except first hit of 3~4
Jin:     b+2,4,4,4
Jun:     any low attack (especially can-can kicks or leg cutter sweeps)
Kazuya:  db+4 or 1,2,4 (any stature kick)


---------------
2.5.2. Sidestep

Although Julia has a good sidestep, she does not have many options
during or after a sidestep.  Still, sidestepping is useful for dodging
attacks.  When you anticipate an attack, you can sidestep to avoid it
then punish the opponent during recovery.  Be careful, some moves can
track (e.g., Nina's Blonde Bomb) or have excellent lateral range (e.g.,
sweeps) on one or both sides and can be sidestepped in one direction
only or cannot be avoided at all by sidestepping.  Below are some
things you can do if you manage to sidestep your opponent.

* throw
The throw is the easiest and most obvious followup.  Depending how far
the opponent advanced, you may get a back throw or a side throw.  Back
throw is inescapable, but the side throws can be escaped.  If you know
that Julia is behind the opponent, go for the back throw.  If not, and
you want more guaranteed results, avoid the side throw and do something
else.  One note:  if you want to throw, you can try to setup Mad Axes
since it is a fast throw.  Just do a QCB then sidestep.  After the
sidestep, press F+2.  Julia will either do the Mad Axes or a side
throw.  The former is a double button break while the latter requires
one button.

* 3+4
If you just sidestepped to the right and you want to go directly behind
your opponent (for a back throw), you can make Julia spin to augment
her sidestep.  This is only useful if the opponent did a slow move or
is winding up for an unblockable.

* SS+2
This is not as damaging as a throw, but it is a solid punishment
move that is easy to do.

* 1+2
This is slower than SS+2, but it has better range and it does more
damage.  Still not as damaging as a throw.

* uf+4
Since Julia does not an excellent sidestep launcher like Michelle,
this is what she is stuck with if you want a juggle.  This can be
effective, but there are some traps you need to be wary of.  First,
if Julia has not finished sidestepping, the uf will cancel the
sidestep and Julia will just do a standing right kick when 4 is
pressed.  Also, Julia can appear to be at the middle of the screen
at times, which can make it very difficult to tell which way is
forward.  If you cannot tell which side of the screen Julia is on,
it is possible to do ub+4 instead by accident.  With these in mind,
if you sidestepped your opponent and can clearly see a hop kick
opportunity (i.e., you are not moving, opponent is still recovering,
and you know which way is forward), take it.


---------------
2.5.3. Throwing

Throws are useful since they are generally easy to do and inflict
good damage.  They are unblockable, but they can be crouched under
or escaped.  When you are close to your opponent and see a chance,
go for the throw if you feel like it.  Throws are also useful as a
retaliation move sometimes, especially if your opponent has a chance
of blocking any other move you try.  Do not try to throw with reckless
abandon though, you can be punished after a missed throw attempt, and
some characters such as Jin can punish severely.

Buffering is often used to make throw inputs more efficient.  You
can attack with something that uses one or more buttons needed by
the throw, hold those buttons down, quickly input stick motions if
necessary, then press the remaining button(s).  Here is an example;
press and hold 1 to jab, then press 3 to throw.  Now for another
example; tap down and press and hold 1 to do a low jab, then quickly
move the stick db,d,DB and press 2.  This will cause Julia to use
the Cross Arm Suplex.

With her variety of useful throws, Julia can be considered a pseudo-
grappler.  One of her basic throws does above average damage and allows
for a guaranteed sweep.  As for command throws, her Mad Axes and Cross
Arm Suplex are very useful.  Both throws do nice damage and require
both punch buttons to break.  Mad Axes is fast, has great range, and
it is delayable.  Cross Arm Suplex is done while crouching, and it
does very good damage and allows followups.  Julia can also use a fast
attack to tick the opponent then quickly grab him or her with either
throw.  For example, the fast Party Crasher (f,f,N+1) is good for
ticking into the Mad Axes throw, and a simple d+1 puts Julia into
crouch so she can buffer the Cross Arm Suplex right away.

Always mixup your throws.  Even double button break throws can be
escaped easily by good players if you become predictable and overuse
them (e.g., abusing Mad Axes setups).


-------------
2.5.4. Poking

Poking is attacking your opponent with moves that execute and recover
quickly.  The purpose of poking is to attack quickly while minimizing
exposure to your opponent's attacks.  Poking can be used to interrupt
your opponent's attack and possibly shift the attack momentum to your
favor.  Poking can also be used to setup more powerful attacks.

Julia is fast and can poke fairly well.  Her pokes are great for
interrupting her opponent's attack because some of them can chain
into high damage strings and/or launchers that are guaranteed if they
counterhit.  Also, some of her poking moves allow Julia to recover
crouching.  What is the benefit for Julia recovering in a crouch?
Julia has several powerful moves that attack at varying hit levels,
and increases the chance that your opponent will block incorrectly
and take damage.  From a crouch, Julia can do a Cross Arm Suplex
throw, Spinning Sweep Combo, Body Elbow, Skyscraper Kick, or any of
the Tequila Sunrise strings.

* 1
One of Julia's easiest pokes is a simple jab.  It has decent range and
it is fast.  While it is among the fastest in execution, it does not
give Julia any frame advantage after it is blocked unlike some other
characters.  Still, you can throw one out at a standing opponent without
much fear of retaliation.  Use it to setup more powerful attacks.
I use it often for two reasons:  to goad my opponent into attacking
so I can interrupt (or trade hits at worst) the attack with 1~1,1 or
1~2~1, or to tick and sometimes buffer a throw (especially Mad Axes).

* d+1
This jab is fast and it is great for poking or interrupting attacks.
In addition, Julia recovers crouching.  From here, she can poke some
more or use one of her powerful FC or WS moves.  One thing you need
to watch out for is Julia (or anyone else) is vulnerable to high
attacks, especially throws, while jabbing low.  One of my favorite
applications of the low jab is to tick the opponent with it and
buffer the Cross Arm Suplex for an easy throw.

* 2
While slightly slower than her left jab, this is useful because if
this connects (i.e., not blocked), the opponent is at a 9 frame
disadvantage, and Julia can easily buffer a throw and grab the
opponent.  The throw is not guaranteed to connect, but the opponent
cannot interrupt it.

* 1~1[,1_4]
* 1~2[~1_3_4]
* df+1[,1_4]
* WS+2,1[,1_4]
Despite relatively long recovery time if blocked, these shortened strings
are important poking tools because of mixup options.  Unless you become
predictable, your opponent will not attack you after the string (usually)
because of timing differences and the opponent's counterattack would be
eaten up by your string in case you did the entire string.  In addition,
some of the strings have low sweeps, and can hit the opponent for minor
damage.  Remember though, 1~1,4 will miss Ganryu.

* 4
Her basic right kick is fast and relatively safe to use.  Think of
it as a jab with somewhat less speed but with more power and reach.
What is great about this is not only its speed, but also it can start
juggles if it counterhits.

* 4,4[,d+4_N+4_1]
These are her Spinning Kicks strings.  The first two kicks are fast,
but are slow enough for experienced and quick thinking players to block
or parry the second kick, which hits low.  Still, unless your opponent
is really good, the first two kicks alone is a useful poke that can
connect at times.  After the low kick, Julia can stop or add one of
three enders.  If you stop at the low kick, Julia recovers crouching,
and you can continue with one of several of her FC or WS moves.
If you choose to add an ender, use either the low kick or the uppercut.
Of the enders, the low kick is the safest.  Since many people do not
want to take the chance of getting hit by the uppercut, they tend to
block high and eat the low kick, resulting in minor damage.  Julia also
recovers crouching if the low kick ender was used.  However, if you
think the opponent might try to block low, go ahead and use the uppercut
ender.  If the uppercut connects, use your class 2 juggle of choice.
Watch out though, if the opponent blocks the uppercut, you will be in
a world of hurt.

* d+4[,d+4_N+4_1]
This is the sweep that preceeds one of three enders.  While it does not
come out as quickly as some of Julia's other punches or kicks, the first
kick hits low, and Julia recovers crouching.  Again, Julia has her mixup
options from the crouch.  If only the first sweep is used, its recovery
is long enough to allow your opponent's fastest attacks to connect
regardless if the sweep hits.  However, it is unlikely your opponent
will try to counterattack since Julia can add the ender.  See the
Spinning Kick strings above regarding the enders.

* FC+4
This is Julia's fastest attack that hits low.  It does not have much
range, and unlike some characters, Julia must be in a full crouch before
she can use this.  It is still useful as its recovery is relatively
short, and it is fast enough to interrupt some strings (like Eddy's).
After the kick, Julia remains crouching.

* d+3
This is a bit slow for a poke, but this sweep hits low (and grounded),
and it is her fastest low attack while Julia is standing.  After the
sweep, Julia recovers crouching.  The lag is relatively long if it
blocked, so make sure it hits if you plan to use this as a poking
weapon.  Do NOT abuse this!  Your opponent may fall for it once,
maybe twice (for minor damage), but if it is blocked or parried just
once, you will be sorry.

* d,df+1[,2]
The dashing left punch from this move has fast execution and good range.
After the punch, Julia can follow up with the elbow ender or stop then
either do another move or do nothing at all.  If you think your opponent
will try to attack after blocking the punch, go for the stun and use
the elbow ender.  This is also good for ticking into throws, especially
if the first punch connects.

* FC,df+4[,3]
This is the first hit of the Spinning Sweep Combo.  It strikes low
and it is often hard to spot the sweep in time before it hits.  After
recovering, Julia remains crouching.  Anytime Julia is crouching and
near her opponent, she can attack with the sweep to chip away life,
and Julia can easily repeat this or do something else.  Know that
if the sweep is blocked, the opponent has enough time to hit Julia
with something fast.

* df+4
This is the first hit of the Mountain Crusher.  It is fast, and it
hits mid.  From here, Julia can either finish the Mountain Crusher
(watch out for sidesteps) or stop and do something else.

* f,f,N+1[,4]
Now in TTT, Julia's Party Crasher can recover as quickly as Michelle's,
though she can still do the delayed version from Tekken 3.  That said,
Julia can use the elbow to close in on her opponent.  Because the elbow
is very fast, it will beat out almost anything the opponent tries.  If
the elbow is blocked, lag is minimal (unless you delayed the recovery).
Like the Rapid Counter Attack, this can setup throws or other attacks.
Below is list of some things you can do after a blocked elbow.  After
a blocked elbow, if you think the opponent will try to...
  ...counterattack with a move slower than 10 frames, go for the
       kill and counter with 1~1,1 or 1~2~1.
  ...counterattack with an 8 frame move that hits high, you can
       do a Flash Uppercut that will evade your opponent's high
       attack and launch the opponent (unless he is heavy).
  ...counterattack with any 8 frame move, use the Skyscraper Kick
       ender.
  ...stand there and block or use a reversal or punch parry, grab
       him or her with Mad Axes.  If you think the opponent will
       escape Mad Axes, use a basic throw instead.
  ...crouch, do any of the following:  Skyscraper Kick ender,
       another elbow, hop kick, or a Slow Power Punch Combo.


Related to poking is custom strings.  A custom string is a string
of moves that seem to flow seamlessly from move to move.  Each move
within the custom string, with the possible exception the ender,
should have fast execution and recovery times; the less frames, the
better.  Basically, it is a string of pokes that may end with a power
move.  Such strings are useful for chipping away your opponent's life
bit by bit or for setting up a variety of moves such as throws.
Below are a few examples.

Example #1:
f,f,N+1, d+1, FC,df+4,3.

Julia starts with a fast recovering Party Crasher elbow.  After that,
uses a quick low jab to get into a crouch.  While crouching, Julia
quickly does the Sweeping Sweep Combo.

Example #2:
f,f,N+1, d+1, f,f,N+1.

Same as the above example except for the Party Crasher after the low
jab.  If the opponent tried to block low, the elbow will knock the
opponent down.  If the opponent blocks the elbow, you can do something
else.  Below are some options:
   f,f,N+1, d+1, f,f,N+1,4.
     Skyscraper Kick will snuff your opponent's counterattack,
     and you can juggle if it hits.

   f,f,N+1, d+1, f,f,N+1, f+1.
     The flash uppercut will evade high attacks and launch the
     opponent if he or she tries to jab high.  (Useful against
     other Chang players who think they can 1~1,1 you first.)

   f,f,N+1, d+1, f,f,N+1, QCB,F+2.
     This will grab the opponent if he or she just stands there.

   f,f,N+1, d+1, f,f,N+1, d+1, ....
     Infinite custom string.  Not recommended but shown as an example.

Example #3:
4,4, WS+2,1[,4], f,F,N+1.

Julia quickly does a high kick then low kick.  After the low kick,
Julia is crouching.  Next, Julia does a partial Tequila Sunrise
string.  After that, Julia closes back in with the Party Crasher.
See example #2 for some possible extensions.


--------------
2.5.5. Okizeme

Okizeme is loosely defined as attacking your opponent while he/she is
down on the ground.  While Julia has good attacks to knock opponents
trying to get up back down, she does not have any fast and powerful
attacks to hit opponents who insist on staying down unless the opponent
is big.  Below is a list of useful attacks for okizeme.

* d+1
If the opponent is rolling toward Julia from a distance, this can
interrupt whatever attacks the opponent tries.  This can pop such
a rolling opponent into the air and you can juggle.

* d+3
Of the moves she has that can hit grounded opponents, this sweep has
the fastest execution time.  It will knock the opponent away and give
him or her time to get up, but at least you will inflict some damage,
and it is the safest attack you can use.

* d+4,[N+4_1]
Like d+3, this will hit grounded opponents.  This does not come out as
quickly as d+3, but it recovers a bit faster, and Julia has the option
of following up with an high kick or uppercut.  Either followup is
guaranteed if the sweep hits when the opponent tries to get up.
The uppercut ender is useful when you know the opponent will try to
get up because it leaves Julia close to her opponent and she can
continue with okizeme.  However, if the opponent stays down and the
uppercut misses, Julia is open to attack.  High kick ender does
slightly more damage, but the opponent will not be close to Julia
and he or she can get up safely.  When in doubt, use the high kick
ender.  If it misses, Julia is safe.  If it hits, it does good damage.
Of course, if you know the opponent will stay down, just do the first
sweep alone then run after the opponent.

* b+3
This sweep has slower execution and recovery time than d+3 or d+4,
but it has longer range.  Generally, the previous sweeps are better
because of speed.

* FC,df+4,3
If Julia is crouching, the Spinning Sweep Combo is one of the best moves
she can do.  It advances Julia and if it hits the opponent while he/she
is trying to get up, it will hit and float the opponent.  While the
opponent is floating, Julia can either juggle or wait until the opponent
lands then attack when the opponent tries to get up again.  If your
opponent refuses to get up, you can either use the sweep only to
inflict damage safely or wait for the opponent to move then try to
catch him or her.  If you choose to wait, you risk getting hit by a
quick attack from your opponent.

* df+4,2,b<f+1
If this connects while the opponent is rolling forward or backward,
the Mountain Crusher will juggle the opponent for nasty damage.

* f,f,N+1
The Party Crasher can hit an opponent rolling forward or backward,
and possibly float him or her for a possible juggle.

* f+1~2
Because of the distance Julia covers during the Palm Explosion, this
will keep up with an opponent who rolls back before getting up or
tagging out, and hit him or her back to the ground.  After the hit,
Julia will remain close to her opponent, and she can harass the
opponent some more.  Against big opponents, this can hit even if
the opponent stays on the ground.

* F+1+4
Her unblockable is guaranteed to hit big characters on the ground,
and it inflicts heavy damage.  Because of its range, the opponent
will have to move quickly to stand a chance of avoiding it.  Smaller
characters can avoid it by just lying still on ground, but if they
flinch in any way, they are vulnerable too.


--------------
2.5.6. Chicken

A "chicken" is a reversal to attack reversals.  Anytime you use a high
or mid punch or kick against a character with attack reversals (Anna,
Jin, Jun, Nina, Paul, or Wang), you should always buffer a chicken if
possible.  Since the Changs are offensive characters, chickens are
very important if you want to stay on the offense against characters
endowed with attack reversals.  A chicken damages your opponent and
shifts the momentum to your favor.

Generally, to chicken an attack, press f+1+3 for left attacks or f+2+4
for right attacks right before or at the moment your opponent tries to
reverse your attack.  For example, Julia uses 1~1,1 against Jin.  Julia
inputs f+1+3 when Jin reverses the last hit.  Jin tries to reverse Julia,
but Julia yanks her arm back and elbows Jin.  Julia has a few attacks
with a non-obvious chicken input.  Shove It Up and Twin Arrow, which
appear to use both hands at once, are treated as left attacks and are
chickened with f+1+3.  Her Heavy Uppercut unblockable is treated as a
right attack and is chickened with f+2+4 even though she uppercuts with
her left hand; the reversing character uses a right punch reversal
animation after reversing the Heavy Uppercut.

Some of Julia's strings, notably 1~1,..., 1~2,..., or 4,4,... strings,
are hard to buffer chickens for the first hit because the input for the
whole string must be done quickly.  My advice is do not use the full
string if you think your opponent will reverse the first hit as you will
likely be caught trying to finish the string if the first attack gets
reversed.  Instead, use either the first hit only, or use the slower
starting alternate versions of those strings (e.g., df+1,... df+2,...,
or d+4,...).  In the case of the slower starting strings, you should
have time to input the whole string before you need to buffer a chicken
for the first hit.

Quick chicken note:
Attack reversed          Escape
-------------------------------
left button or limb    -- f+1+3
right button or limb   -- f+2+4
1+2 (Twin Arrow)       -- f+1+3
f+1+2 (Shove It Up)    -- f+1+3
F+1+4 (Heavy Uppercut) -- f+2+4


--------------------------
2.5.7. Supercharger Tricks

When Julia is supercharged, her moves will inflict guard damage if
they are blocked, or will counterhit on any hit.  Below are some tips
that can help you use the supercharger wisely.

Because of the time it takes to supercharge, you should only use the
supercharger when it is safe to do it.  One occasion to supercharge
is after you knock the opponent down and away from Julia (e.g.,
after CH Twin Arrow).  By the time the opponent recovers, Julia
will be supercharged.

If your opponent has only a tiny sliver of life left, the guard damage
from a blocked supercharged attack can K.O. the opponent.  Since the
Party Crasher and Rapid Counter Attack have excellent speed and reach,
it will beat out many of your opponents' attacks, and they are the
best attacks Julia can use for this purpose.

Some of Julia's strings combo on a counterhit, and some of her moves
will leave the opponent open to juggles only on a counterhit.  With
the supercharger, Julia can sneak in some of these moves in that can
result in a big payoff if it hits.  One example of this is Julia's
Liquid Sweep (b+3).  After charging up, Julia can run in, Liquid
Sweep the opponent, and if it hits, Julia can juggle opponent because
the supercharged sweep will always counterhit if it hits the opponent.
If the opponent starts to block low in anticipation for the sweep,
you can use her other mid-hitting jugglestarters, including G-Clef
Cannon (1~1,1).

One more thing about supercharger:  Julia can supercharge, tag in
her partner and her partner will be supercharged; and vice versa.
You can tag when you anticipate an attack, then punish the opponent
during recovery.


//---------------------//
//  2.6. Tag Partners  //
//---------------------//

A good partner for Julia is someone who can take advantage her strengths,
cover her weaknesses, and most importantly, hold his or her own in case
Julia gets hurt badly and needs to rest.  Below is a general and rather
simple-minded list of pros and cons of each character, followed by a
small list of recommended partners.  Even though some characters are
more powerful and/or tag combo friendly than others, everyone is strong
enough to win.  (That is why I removed the character evaluations present
in previous versions of this guide.)

Julia is one of the more powerful characters in the game, and she has
excellent speed and very powerful juggles.  Her only (minor) weaknesses
is her lack of a powerful defense and risk-free tag launchers.  Anyone
who can fill that void is obviously a good partner for Julia.  Because
of her overall power, Julia herself is a good partner for just about
anyone.


Alex/Roger
Pros:  Small body; very fast jabs; relatively fast TGF worth 50 damage;
         painful command throws; guard-breaking windmill punch with
         guaranteed followups; SS sweep that can cheese newbies to death.
Cons:  Poor reach; low stamina; mediocre class 2 juggling ability;
         awkward tag launcher.

Angel/Devil
Pros:  Mishima moves (i.e., flash punches, crouch dash, WGF, hell sweeps,
         tsunami kicks, and stone head throw); standing twin pistons;
         powerful SS class 1 launcher; high stamina.
Cons:  Limited moveset; limited class 2 juggling.  Devil has no netsu,
         and his standing beam is ineffective against small opponents.
         Angel has relatively short arms.

Anna
Pros:  Fast; great defense (i.e., reversal, auto-parry, cat stance);
         powerful juggles; well-rounded.
Cons:  Less than reliable tag launchers (somersault flip kick and
         some uppercuts); her best juggles are difficult to do
         after Julia's tag launchers.

Armor King
Pros:  Above-average stamina; moves with good range and/or power;
         WGF; good juggling skills; powerful command throws.
         (Very solid character overall.)
Cons:  His better juggles are not very easy to do.

Baek
Pros:  Good poking strings; has at least one easy and damaging juggle;
         punch parry with guaranteed and damaging followups.
Cons:  Somewhat limited moveset; slow tag launchers.

Bruce
Pros:  Fast; great reach; strings that are killer on CH; easy 40+
         damage juggles; punch that auto-reverses opponent's punch
         attacks.
Cons:  Limited moveset; many moves do not track well; weak throws.

Bryan
Pros:  Fast and powerful moves; punch parry; strong juggles;
         useful mixups; relatively fast unblockables.
Cons:  Limited throwing options; limited low attacks.

Eddy/Tiger
Pros:  Unusual and confusing moves; normal stance can auto-sidestep.
Cons:  Many moves and strings suffer from major lag; poor sidestep;
         limited juggling skills.

Ganryu
Pros:  Heavy; fast and powerful moves; punch parry; above-average
         stamina; good mixups; powerful juggles; long-range unblockable
         that evades many attacks and can be cancelled.
Cons:  Slow tag launchers; big target (but not as big as Jacks, Kuma,
         or True Ogre).

Gun Jack
Pros:  High power and stamina; heavy; fast and taggable WS launcher;
         good mixups; powerful throws.
Cons:  Large size makes him susceptible to more damaging combos;
         slow; small sidestep; no powerful juggles after Julia's
         tag launchers.

Heihachi
Pros:  Mishima moves; powerful tag launchers; strong juggles; vicious
         okizeme.  (Extremely powerful overall.)
Cons:  Low stamina; gets netsu in 7 hits and Julia loses netsu.

Hwoarang
Pros:  Powerful launchers and juggles; kicks with good power and reach;
         excellent movement abilities.
Cons:  Limited low attacks.

Jack-2
Pros:  High power and stamina; heavy; fast and taggable WS launcher;
         good mixups; powerful throws; good okizeme.
Cons:  Large size makes him susceptible to more damaging combos;
         slow; small sidestep; no powerful juggles after Julia's
         tag launchers; no netsu.

Jin
Pros:  Mishima moves; powerful tag launchers; fast and taggable WS
         launcher; class 3 juggles; juggles that do 40+ damage;
         reversal; useful unblockables.
Cons:  Limited low attacks.

Jun
Pros:  Confusing strings; good defense (i.e., reversal, evasive moves);
         class 3 juggles; right punch always launches.
Cons:  Relatively slow; low power and stamina.

Kazuya

---------------------
3.1.1. About Michelle

Michelle is an offensive character who relies on speed, counterhits,
mixups, and juggles to win.  Michelle does not have fast power shots
like Paul or Ogre, she does not have many defensive turtle-friendly
moves (i.e., reversals) like Law or Nina, she does not have any special
stances like Lei or Yoshimitsu, she does not have multipart throws
like King or Nina, and she is not very easy to use like Law or Paul.
Why play her?  Aside from pretty looks, Michelle has fast jabs (and
other moves) that can lead into damaging combos that launch if they
counterhit.  Michelle also has nasty mixups that will frustrate an
opponent who cannot defend against them properly.

3.1.2. Strengths

I will explain briefly on Michelle's strengths.

Combos:  This is how Michelle inflicts heavy damage, whether the combo
is a canned string guaranteed on counterhit, a high damage juggle,
or a combination of both.  Even more so than Julia, Michelle has
several strings that are true combos if the first attack connects
as a counterhit (i.e., hit the opponent during his or her move
execution), and these alone often remove 25-40% life.  Michelle is
also a very good juggler.  Although Michelle does not have Julia's
class 2 juggle power, Michelle is capable of 35+ damage juggles,
and she can start combos more easily than Julia.  Her class 1 juggles
are on par with Julia's, and she is capable of class 3 juggles.

Mixups:  I am not talking about the various canned strings and their
relatives (e.g., Tequila Sunrise) mind you, though they are effective
against beginners and intermediates.  What I really mean is the powerful
options Michelle can do after a fast poking move or custom string, and a
mistake on the opponent's part can cost him or her up to half a life bar.

Sidestep:  Michelle has good sidestepping range.  While her sidestep is
not as wide as Law, Lee, or Ogre, she can evade attacks fairly well with
her sidestep alone.  Michelle also has a special move that lets her spin
to her right side.  When used in conjuction with her normal sidestep,
she can strafe very well, and she can move behind an attacker quickly.
In addition to excellent sidestep range, Michelle has powerful sidestep
attacks that can easily poke and/or start combos.

Speed:  Michelle has very fast moves that are useful for poking or
interrupting.  In the Changs' case, speed and combos go hand-in-hand.
Her basic standing left jab or right kick are fast and can start
damaging combos if either counterhit.  Her quick elbows can also
stop many of her opponents' attacks, and they are great combo starters
as well.


-----------------
3.1.3. Weaknesses

I will explain briefly on Michelle's weaknesses.

Defense:  First, Michelle has no high/mid reversal or parry.  While such
a move by itself is not great defense, it does mean that the opponent
can use high/mid attacks without fear of them getting caught, and
is not restricted by either inputting chickens frequently or using
only moves that cannot be parried.  However, the main reason I think
Michelle does not have good defense is because she is not a very good
minor counter mistake punisher.  Her best damage dealing moves either
require a major counter or do not have enough reach or speed to
connect during a small opening.  For example, if the opponent whiffs
a jab in front of Michelle, Michelle can probably hit with an elbow
or something similar, but this results in minor damage.  Compare that
to what Heihachi or Jin can do, who can punish the opponent with an
(E)WGF followed by 35-45 damage juggle, which totals to about half
a life bar.  In short, Michelle cannot turtle very well.

Lag:  Many of Michelle's moves have long execution and/or recovery time.
Also, some of her sweeps can be low parried on reaction, even more if
anticipated.

Stamina:  Michelle has low stamina -- she takes more damage per hit
than most characters.  Nothing more needs to be said.

Throwing:  Unlike Julia, Michelle was not made to grapple.  Her
throws do average damage at best, and none of them have the speed
or reach to be very effective.

Compared to the left jab, the right jab has more reach and does more
damage, but it is slower.  If it connects, Michelle will have a nice
frame advantage.  In my experience, I found that a throw is a great
followup to use during the frame advantage.  The right jab is also
the start of Michelle's (useless) tenstrings.

By itself, this sweep has relatively slow execution, and the recovery
is not too good even if it hits (but better than d+3 if blocked).
Still, the sweep is useful and relatively safe because it hits low and
grounded opponents, and since this is the start of Razor's Edge and a
couple other sweep strings, Michelle can followup with one of the enders.
After the sweep, Michelle recovers crouching.  Also, this sweep recovers
faster than d+3 when used in okizeme.

This is a puny uppercut with little range, but it is her fastest and
safest WS attack.  Thanks to Michelle's Snake Step (SS+2), this is
more useful to her than it is to Julia because WS+1 is one of the
safest followups Michelle can use if you do not know Snake Step will
connect.  In other situations, this is somewhat useful if you want
to stand up from a crouch and poke at the same time.

By itself, the uppercut is useless because it is slow in execution and
recovery.  However, it is the start of several powerful strings Michelle
has.  Each Tequila Sunrise string consists of strikes of varying hit
levels and can provide a mean guessing game to the opponent if used
unpredictably.  Also, if the uppercut connects on a counterhit, then
all the hits in the rest of the Tequila Sunrise strings are guaranteed.

Think of this as the WS version of 3.  This is almost useless because
there are better moves that are safer and can inflict more damage
(e.g., Spinning Sweep Combo, Skyscraper Kick followed by low sweep).
Perhaps the only time this could be of any use is if the time is down
to the final second and you need a powerful final strike from a crouch.

Unlike most characters, Michelle does not have a basic juggling uppercut.
Instead, she does a straight punch to the gut.  By itself, this punch
is not very useful because has some execution lag and lousy range, and
the damage is low.  The punch is the start of the Slow Power Punch
strings, so if you use this punch, always go for the followup.

In TTT, anyone can low parry by tapping df within 9 frames of impact
from an incoming low attack.  It does not matter if the defender is
crouching or standing.  The universal low parry has no execution
or recovery animation -- your character will automatically parry
the attack if possible.  What the low parry does is catch and push
aside most of your opponents' moves that hit low and the basic low
jabs that hit special mid.  The opponent loses balance for a moment
which gives Michelle an attack advantage -- 9 frames after a low punch
parry or 16 frames after a low kick parry.  A few specific attacks,
such as slides, will put the opponent down to the ground if parried.
In the case of a parried low kick, a hop kick can connect, and a hop
kick plus juggle is the most damaging follow up after a low parry.
However, the hop kick is not necessarily guaranteed, because it can
miss.  Whether or not the hop kick can hit depends on how close the
attacker is and the attacker's size.  If you think a hop kick will
miss, you can use other attacks such as the Party Crasher that will
hit for minor damage.  The low parry is very useful because it stops
your opponent's attack, and any guaranteed damage is better than none.
Unlike Julia, this is the only way Michelle can low parry, so learn
this!

The hop kick is one of Michelle's best launchers.  It is moderately fast,
hits mid, and does good damage by itself.  Unfortunately, her hop kick
has bad recovery time, so do not throw it out randomly.  However, if
you see an opening, do not hesitate to use this.  A hop kick plus

Michelle does a high jump then does a left side kick that can hit mid or
low depending on when the button is pressed.  If pressed when Michelle
starts to descend from the apex of her jump, the kick will hit mid
and cause a double-over stun on a normal hit or a rollback knockdown
on a counterhit.  If pressed while Michelle is close to the ground, the
kick hit low and act much like a d+3.  This is a useful and unorthodox
mixup from medium range that is guaranteed to take your opponent by

This is a high jump attack that looks like a hop kick.  Outside of
juggling, this kick is of little use.  However, this kick is great
in juggles because it hurts.  Unfortunately for Michelle, she can
only use it in class 1 juggles, and her only class 1 launcher is
her (slow) unblockable.  Having a tag partner with a good class 1
launcher can help Michelle greatly, as this is the key to her
powerful class 1 juggles.  To do this kick, you need to hold UF
then press 4 as soon as Michelle jumps.

This is one of Michelle's best launchers against normal-sized opponents,
and it begins with just a simple jab.  Since Michelle's jabs come out
fast, use this to interrupt your opponent's attack then juggle him or
her.  Since this string uses only one button, this is also a good panic
button combo to use if you see something nasty coming, such as some
unblockables.  On counterhit, this string combos and does good damage
by itself.  If the last hit is blocked, Michelle has some recovery,
long enough to be open to a quick counterattack, which can be bad news
against some opponents (e.g., Heihachi).  This move is not very effective
against heavy characters like the Jacks because it does not launch them
even if the last hit connects unless a tag is buffered, and even then it
does not launch as high.  Overall, the full string is a risky move but
the payoff if it lands makes it worthwhile.  It is best used to interrupt
incoming attacks.  In addition to the full string, the first two punches
alone are useful as pokes.  If you see that the first two punches are
blocked, you can stop at the second punch, or you can do 1~1,1, 1~1,4,
or 1~1,4,3 and hope the opponent defends incorrectly.  (See 1~1,4,3

Michelle dashes forward a small distance then strikes with an uppercut.
The dash can go under high attacks.  The uppercut, if it hits, launches
normal-sized characters but only staggers heavy characters (unless a
tag is buffered).  The dash makes its execution time relatively slow.
Recovery time is slow too.  Nonetheless, it is a useful move because
it can counter predictable players who abuse effective moves that hit
high (such as standing 4).

This is even more useful to Michelle than it is to Julia.  Although
this move looks the same as Julia's, its properties are different.
Against a standing opponent, the elbow does NOT knock down.  However,
if the elbow counterhits, the followup skyscraper kick is guaranteed,
and the kick will knockdown.  Both hits together do good damage, and
juggling is possible after the knockdown.  The skyscraper kick has some
recovery, so make sure it will hit before you use it.  Also, Michelle
cannot delay the skyscraper kick like Julia.  (Personally though, I
think the lack of delay is better because it does not interfere with
juggling.)  Overall, this is one of Michelle's most important moves.

The first two hits are the same as 1~1,1 so players expecting the 1~1,1
may fail the block the bow and arrow kick and take good damage.  If the
4 hits, the 3 is guaranteed if the opponent is close enough.  Like 1~1,1,
if the first jab counterhits, the entire string will combo.  While the
damage is not as high as 1~1,1 plus juggle, the full string is good
to use occasionally.  The low kick is slow enough that experienced
players can block or parry it on reaction, so be careful.  If the
whole string is blocked the recovery is somewhat long, even longer
if the last hit whiffs.  In addition, the size of a few characters
present additional complications.  Ling is small enough that the 3
will miss her unless Michelle is very close, and Ganryu is immune to
the bow and arrow kick because the jabs push him too far away.  One
major reason why this and 1~1,1 are useful is because partial strings
are useful pokes.  In this case, you can do 1~1 or 1~1,4; either string
if blocked leaves Michelle relatively safe because the opponent will
likely not try to retaliate.  1~1,4 is also useful for setting up
attacks since Michelle recovers crouching after the 4.

This combo works only if the first jab strikes as a counterhit.
However, if this lands, the damage from this alone rivals that of
Paul's Phoenix Smasher!  Not only that, but also the last hit launches
and Michelle can perform a juggle afterward to drain even more life.
Even heavy characters are launched with ease by this move.  If you
do not get the counterhit, or it does not hit the opponent's front,
all you get is 1~2, and its recovery is slightly worse than 1~1,1.
Nonetheless, it is generally safe because of the threat of 1~2 mixups.
Like the G-Clef strings, this also starts with a simple jab.  Compared
to 1~1, 1~2 is faster and more damaging, but has less range.  If you
are fighting a heavy character or your partner has weak tag class 2
juggles, use this instead of 1~1,1 as your main counterhit weapon.

The last hit of this string strikes low.  Michelle also recovers
crouching after it.  This can be useful for sneaking in a low hit
once in a while.  Be careful, recovery if it misses or is blocked
is relatively long, and opponents with WS launchers (e.g., Jin or Law)
can punish Michelle severely.  In addition, the low parry can stop the
sweep and open Michelle up for free damage.  Even if your opponent is
incapable of powerful FC or WS attacks and low parry followups, this
remains something you cannot abuse (unless your opponent is a beginner
and does not know how to defend against this).  To be honest, the low
kick is not very useful because it is relatively slow and the risk is
(generally) too great for such a small gain.

I have mixed feelings about this move.  The kick goes high, so it will
miss an opponent who is waiting for 1~2,3 (as if 1~2,3 was not dangerous
enough to use), and he or she can punish you.  On the other hand, it
can counterhit aggressive opponents trying to get the jump on Michelle
after blocking an anticipated 1~2 or failed 1~2~1.  If the right kick
counterhits, the opponent will be in air and open to CH 4 juggles.
Aside from attacking an overaggressive opponent, this may have some
use in juggling for it is easy to do, though the damage is not the best.
Overall, this is probably a little more useful than 1~2,3 because the
danger is about the same, but the rewards are greater.

This is a fast, far reaching left punch with great speed.  It is similar

The spin occurs only after the jab connects.  After the spin the
opponent will have his/her backturned to Michelle.  Since Michelle has
a slight disadvantage after the spin, you need to anticipate what your
opponent will do and act accordingly.  It is a guessing game on both
sides.  If you think the opponent will crouch, launch him or her with
a jump kick at the back and juggle.  If you think the opponent will
attack with a move that does not hit mid, crouch then, if the attack
misses, counterattack.  Do not bother with any of the followup links --
your opponent's fastest backturned attacks will beat them out.  In
addition, the opponent also has time to crouch under any link.

This looks like 1~2~1 minus the first left jab, but the properties
are different.  The initial punch has short range and executes
relatively slowly, but if it connects the opponent's front on any
hit (no CH needed), the 1 will launch, and you can follow up with
a juggle.  The recovery time is significantly faster than 1~2, so
this is a relatively safe move to use.  If you block a move with
long recovery time and you are standing close to the opponent,
this is a good safe move to punish the opponent with.  Compared

This is one of Michelle's moves from a crouch.  It has fast execution
time and good range, but slow recovery time.  It knocks down on a normal
hit and stuns on a counterhit.  It has two main uses:  retaliation and
interruption.  If you block a low attack or see an opening while you
are crouching, and you need a fast move with good range, this will
hit for mild damage.  Keep in mind that the Spinning Sweep Combo and
Skyscraper Kick plus followups do more damage.  If you anticipate an
attack, use the elbow to interrupt.  The elbow will likely beat out
your opponent's attack and stun the opponent, and you can follow up
with a damaging combo if the opponent does not break out of the stun.
Overall, it is a powerful attack if you use it at the right times.

Though not on the movelist by itself, this deserves special attention.
The first uppercut hits mid, and the low kick hits... well, low.
The low kick is slow enough for people with quick reflexes to block
or parry on reaction.  Depending on your opponent, this string can
either be very effective or very dangerous to you.  If the low kick
hits, any of the three enders is guaranteed.  If the low kick is
blocked, it is a guessing game in Michelle's favor -- she can stop
here or add one of three possible enders.  If the low kick is parried,
Michelle may be in big trouble.  If Michelle stops at the low kick,
she will recover crouching, and she can attack again soon.  Unless your
opponent is adept at parrying the low kick, this can be used as part
of your poking strings.  Remember though, if the low kick hits, any
of the three enders is guaranteed.

This is the most risky yet most devastating of the Slash Uppercut
strings.  The 4 hits low, and if it connects, the 1 is guaranteed,
which is a launching uppercut.  Recovery is slow, so use this only
if you think you opponent will not block (or parry) the 4.  This
is guaranteed to tear beginners apart, but it loses its effectiveness
against better players.

This is similar to the above string except for the high kick at
the end, and it is almost useless.  It recovers more slowly than the
uppercut, although at least it will not put Michelle into her opponent's
face, but then again it may not matter.  In addition, the high kick
does not launch, so the damage is not as good as the uppercut followed
by a juggle.  If your opponent manages to block the low kick after the
WS+2 uppercut, you can stop the string, use the low kick ender if you
think the opponent will block high, or go for broke and use the uppercut
if you think the oppoent will block low.

This is similar to the above two strings except for the low kick at
the end.  If the first sweep hits, so will the second sweep.  If the
first sweep is blocked, chances are your opponent will eat the last
sweep rather than risk getting launched by the uppercut ender.  In
addition, Michelle recovers crouching after the last sweep.  While
the damage and recovery are not that great, this is generally safer.
If the last sweep is blocked, Michelle is vulnerable to quick moves,
even though the lag is less than the other two enders.

Do not let the low damage and hit level fool you.  This move is very
useful, and the benefits are well worth its moderate execution.  What
this move does is move Michelle forward and put her into a crouch at
the same time.  Afterwards, Michelle can use her powerful FC or WS
moves afterwards.  If the move is blocked, Michelle recovers very
quickly and is not at a frame disadvantage.  If the move connects,
the opponent will be vulnerable long enough for a guaranteed fast
hit.  As far as I know, a Skyscraper Kick is guaranteed after a
successful SS+2 hit.

Michelle starts the Snake Step, then interrupts it and does a Burning
Palm Crush.  In short, this is like a delayed SS+1 that does more
damage.  Because execution time is slow, you will likely not hit
your opponent unless he/she tries to reverse or parry the Snake Step.
This is useful for psyching out your opponent at times, but it is
too slow to be useful for much else.

This move has good range, does good damage, and causes block stun if
your opponent blocks so it is safe to use as long as it does not miss.
The move knocks down on a normal hit.  On counterhit, the opponent is
knocked back far spinning head over heels, and you can run after your
opponent.  The downside of this move is that it has relatively slow
execution time.  Unlike Julia, Michelle is at a slight disadvantage
after recovering from Twin Arrow, so she cannot use it to stun the
opponent and gain an attack advatage.  Like Julia, Michelle can use
this to attack opponents who sidestep a small distance, though
Michelle's SS+1 is a more effective anti-sidestep attack.

This is Michelle's best sidestep move, and it is one of the best
sidestep launchers in the game.  Damage from both kicks, especially
on a counterhit, is high, and the second kick launches normal-sized
characters.  Although the kicks do not launch heavy characters, a jab
will easily knock such characters off their feet while they stagger,
and can be juggled just as easily as everyone else.  Recovery is
reasonably fast as long as you do not miss.  The only downside to this
move is the second kick whiffs if Michelle is not close to her opponent.
The best time to use this move is after you sidestep your opponent and
Michelle is close enough for a side throw to connect; both kicks should
connect then.  Also, the first kick alone can be used as a poke.

These are the first two hits of Michelle's Spinning Kicks series.
While the Spinning Kicks by itself is not in the movelist, it is one
of Michelle's more useful moves.  The first kick goes high and the
second kick low.  Both kicks are relatively fast, and the second kick
recovers quickly, which makes this move a good poke.  The kicks have
fairly good range, and they move Michelle forward a bit.  The low kick
will also stop opponents who try to sidestep around Michelle.  One
other very useful property about this move is Michelle recovers
crouching after the low kick, which means Michelle can start her FC
or WS mixups from the crouch.  This move is very good, but it has
one weaknesses -- the low parry.  Now that everyone has it, any
player who sees the kicks coming can parry the low kick then punish
Michelle during her recovery.

This string executes quickly, but the uppercut ender has poor recovery.
Against a standing opponent, the uppercut will launch if it connects,
but unless you are sure the uppercut will hit (e.g., opponent expects
4,4,d+4; opponent attacks and gets countered by the first 4), do not
use this because you will be punished.  This string does have use in
combos.  If the first 4 counterhits, it will knockdown the opponent,
and the uppercut is guaranteed.  Also, if you are behind your opponent
and close enough for a back throw to connect, all three hits can combo,
but the uppercut may miss smaller characters because the kicks knock
the opponent forward.  If you manage to launch, you can follow up with
a juggle for major damage.  In addition, this by itself is also a
damaging juggle.

Like the above string, this has fast execution time, but the last hit
has slow recovery time.  The last hit can be ducked, so this should
not be used on a standing or crouching opponent doing nothing.
However, like 4,4,1, this string has its uses.  If the first 4
counterhits, the opponent is knocked away and the last kick will hit.
As with 4,4,1; this string is damaging in juggles if all three hits
connect.

This string is fast and it is great for chipping away your opponent's
life bar.  Michelle also recovers crouching, which means she can use FC
or WS moves afterwards.  Most of the time, your opponent will block high
because of the uppercut ender, so this will connect often.  If blocked,
the low sweep has the least lag of the three enders, but it is still
long enough for Michelle to get hit by something fast.

This is like 4,4,1 without the first high kick.  The sweep comes out
slowly.  The uppercut is not guaranteed even if the sweep counterhits.
Do not use this on a standing opponent unless you are sure you opponent
will not or cannot block it, because its slow recovery will allow your
opponent to punish you hard.  In juggles, this is actually a very good
ender, and it is easy to do.  This move can also be handy in okizeme
if you can catch your opponent trying to get up as it will knock him
or her back down and Michelle will be close to the opponent after the
uppercut.  Overall, this move is quite useful.

This is another very useful move Michelle has, and it is done from
a crouch.  The sweep seems to come out quickly and if it hits, the
followup kick is guaranteed to hit if Michelle is close enough to the
opponent.  The total damage from both hits is quite good.  The only
weaknesses of this move is recovery time and it is prone to miss Ling
unless Michelle is very deep when the sweep hits.  However, do not let
that stop you from using this move when you see an opening.  If at
anytime you are crouching and close to your opponent, and your
opponent is standing, do this for some easy damage.  If you are not
close enough such that the second kick may not hit, or the opponent
might crouch in time to block low, just do the first sweep only;
Michelle will recover crouching quickly enough.  (Actually, she is
vulnerable, but the opponent will often wait for the second kick so
chances are that Michelle will not get hit.)  This move is also useful
in juggles and okizeme.

This kick comes out fast and covers her entire front.  Always knocks down

damaging juggles are guaranteed if the opponent is big (e.g., Jacks).
If the kick is blocked, the opponent will be pushed away a bit.  However,
the recovery is a bit slow, and the opponent has time to attack you with
something fast.  Nonetheless, this is a good defensive or retaliation

Even though the execution time is slow, this move is a great tag
launcher.  With this, Michelle will dash under high attacks then pop up
with two kicks.  The second kick will launch if it connects.  The damage
from both hits alone is very good.  If it blocked, the opponent staggers
back, leaving Michelle safe.  If it whiffs, Michelle recovers slowly and
is in trouble.  Unfortunately, the greatest weakness of this move is
that the second kick is prone to miss unless Michelle is very close to
her opponent and/or the opponent tries to close in with an attack.
Anticipate when your opponent will attack with something high (even
if it is a jab or throw), and try to launch with this.

This move is not useless, but the times when it is useful are uncommon.
Since Michelle jumps high into the air before coming down with a painful
stomp, the move is slow.  If the stomp misses or is blocked, Michelle
will be wide open to all sorts of punishment.  The stomp has a strange
hit area against a standing opponent -- it hits if it touches the
opponent's head or back.  The most useful application of the stomp is
in combos.  The stomp is guaranteed to hit after any of her double-over
stun inducing moves (provided the opponent does not break out of the
stun), some special tag throws, and some launchers that do not allow
techrolling.  The stomp is also useful in hitting your opponent
out of a dangerous stance from mid range.  For example, Lei's
drunken stance or play dead tricks, Ling's Art of the Phoenix,
Eddy's handstands, or Kuma's Hunting Bear.

The first two hits are nothing special.  Execution time of the last hit
is far too slow.  Your opponent has time to sidestep around Michelle
(even big characters like Jack can sidestep twice easily and throw
Michelle from behind), hit Michelle out of the dash before the uppercut
hits (though the dash will go under high attacks), or at the very
least block.  If for some reason the uppercut connects, it will
launch normal-sized characters and you can juggle, but do not count
on that happening.  This used to be an easy, damaging juggle for
Michelle in Tekken 2.  With the advent of techrolling and faster
recovery in Tekken 3 and TTT, it is easy to avoid the uppercut,
and it is just as useless as Julia's.  In short, stay away from
this move.

This unblockable has good range, but it is too slow to be of much use
since an alert player has time to either back away to safety or rush
in and interrupt it.  However, Michelle will dash under high attacks
once she starts moving.  If this connects, the opponent will suffer
heavy damage and be launched very high, and you can follow up with a
class 1 juggle for even more damage.  This unblockable hits mid and
can hit grounded big characters.  This move is lethal to big characters
because they are especially vulnerable to it in some circumstances.
Comments on the unblockable's tracking ability:  Until Michelle starts
dashing, the unblockable can track the opponent like many other
unblockables.  The dash is linear.  However, Michelle can reorient
herself to face the opponent after she stops dashing.  Her
reorientation gives the unblockable a bit more reach toward the
opponent's general direction, which may be enough to connect an
opponent who would have otherwise sidestepped the unblockable.

The first six hits in each of Michelle's tenstrings are the same.  The
fifth hit can be low parried.  The sixth hit goes high, so it can be
easily interrupted then.  Even though there is a possible mixup on
the eighth hit, it is followed by a break point so the last two hits
are not guaranteed even if the eighth hit connects, so the last two
hits are easily blocked.  Michelle's tenstrings are only effective
against novice players who do not know how to defend against them

//---------------//

Below is a list of combos that Michelle can use.  There are far too
many combos to list them all, so I have listed the more noteworthy
ones -- namely the more popular combos and a few variants.  The combos
are separated by combo starters.  The most common starter is the
launcher, but combos can also be started by a stun, a trip, or even
a knockdown move that does not allow the opponent to tech roll.
Unless specified otherwise, all the listed combos assume that the
opponent is facing toward Michelle.

While the opponent is helpless in the air, any hits in the juggle do
less than full damage.  The first hit in the juggle does 80% damage,
while all successive hits do 50% damage.  Note that hits in a combo
on an opponent standing on the ground do full damage.  Each combo
listed has an approximate damage value next to it, based on the
damage formula.  I have done the damage calculations by hand (since
I do not have a PSX), so the damage values in some juggles may be off
by a point or two due to rounding.

These juggles are possible after class 3 tag launchers or better,
and all of them begin with the Party Crasher.  Due to their ease
of use and versatility, they are Michelle's staple combos.

* f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1
Michelle can repeat elbows until the opponent is pushed too far away to
be hit by anything else.  Up to five elbows can connect, maybe six if
the elbows are dash buffered.  If the opponent is big, six elbows can
be done more easily.

* f,f+1, f,f+1, d+4,1
If you want an elbow juggle that is simple, reliable, and reasonably
damaging, this is the one to use.

* f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,4
This elbow juggle does slightly more damage than the above combos.
It is relatively easy to do, especially if you dash buffer the elbows.
If you want to up the difficulty and add an extra five points of damage,
you can add a fifth elbow (before the skyscraper kick of course).  For
five elbows, you must dash buffer every elbow.

* f,f+1, d,DF+1, d+4,1
* f,f+1, d,DF+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,4

These are more damaging variants of the above juggles.  The Rapid

though consecutive d,DF+1 punches are not possible.

NOTE:  From here on, the above juggles and their variants will be
refered to as "elbow juggles".

Bryan's b+1 on normal hit or Paul's FC,DF+2,2.  The juggles below do
not inflict as much damage as the above elbow juggles, but they are
easier to do because the sweep will hit grounded opponents and bounce
them into the air for the followup hit.

These are juggles that can be used after most class 2 tag launchers.
For juggles that start with d+2, you can start with the easier and
faster (but less damaging) d+1 instead if necessary.  Comments on
the following juggles:

* 3
This is dead simple and easy.  However, Michelle's 3 is not as damaging
as some of the other characters' standing 3 or 4, and the damage is
low compared to Michelle's better juggles.  Also, this will not work
with all class 2 launchers.

* 1~2,4
This is relatively easy to do since no stick motions are involved.
However, damage is relatively low.

* 1~2, f,f+1, f,f+1,4
The initial 1~2 acts much like the first two elbows in other juggles.
Otherwise, no other comments.

* 4,4,1
This is a simple but damaging juggle.  This is easy to connect on
big opponents, but it is much harder to connect on smaller opponents.
It can hit anyone though.  The key is to hit the opponent with the
high kick as low as possible, so the low kick hits.

* 4,4,4
This is more damaging and masher-friendly than 4,4,1, but it is
even tougher to connect on normal-sized opponents since the third
kick does not have as much reach as the uppercut.  Otherwise,
comments from 4,4,1 apply here too.

* d+2, f,f+1, d+4,1
* d+2, f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,4

* F+2, d,DF+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,4
A jab can substitute the first Party Crasher in most of the class 3
elbow juggles.

* d+2, FC,df+4,3
The damage this juggle inflicts is relatively low.  However, more hits
are possible after the Sweeping Sweep Combo if you are fast enough.
Since Michelle lacks Julia's Mountain Crusher, she cannot inflict
as much damage, and her followups are more limited.

* d+2, FC,df+4,3, f,f+1,4
Without the Mountain Crusher, this is the easiest followup worth doing.
However, this is risky -- you must be fast to connect the Party Crasher.
If you are too slow and miss, the opponent will hit ground and can tech
roll and get up before Michelle can recover.

* d+2, FC,df+4,3, f,f+1, d,DF+1
This is a variant of the above juggle.  It is just as risky, and it
is a bit harder to do, but the damage is a bit higher.

* d+2, FC,df+4,3, f,f+1, f,F+1,4
This is a difficult juggle.  Just connecting with the first elbow
after the Spinning Sweep Combo is difficult enough. Dash buffering
the second elbow long enough so that it and the skyscraper kick can
hit is even more difficult.  This is perhaps Michelle's most damaging
class 2 juggle -- if you can pull it off.

<untechable>
Below is another juggle that can be used after Bryan's CH b+1 or King's
CH f,N,d,DF+1+2.  Those launchers not only bounce high enough for a
class 2 juggle, but also the opponent cannot tech roll after landing.

* uf+3+4
This is very easy to do and the damage from this as comparable to
that from Michelle's best class 2 juggles.

<cross-up>
Below is a juggle that involves Michelle attacking with a move that
goes under an airborne opponent and hits the opponent in the back,
then Michelle and the opponent end up back-to-back because of the
attack's momentum.  (This is similar to SF2's Ryu or Ken jumping over
the likes of M.Bison/Vega and hitting them at the back of the head
with a jumping roundhouse.)

* f,f,N+1 <cross up>, BK 3_4
If Michelle is too close to the opponent when you try to juggle with
the Party Crasher, and the opponent is just above Michelle's head,
Michelle will dash underneath her opponent, hit him/her in the back,
and Michelle will end up backturned (BK).  After that, her only option
is a simple backturned kick.  Damage is relatively low (I am assuming
her BK kicks do 25 damage normally), and not as high as her normal
class 3 elbow juggles.

<normal>
These are juggles that can be used after most class 1 tag launchers.
Since Michelle does not have the lethal class 2 juggles Julia has,
Michelle should use class 1 juggles because they match or exceed the
damage done by her best class 2 juggles.  Comments:

* UF,4, f,f+1, d+4,1
* UF,4, f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,4
* UF,4, d,DF+1, d+4,1
* UF,4, d,DF+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,4
Take a class 3 elbow juggle, replace the first elbow with a jump kick,
and... you get the idea.  The jump kick hits much harder than an elbow
so that damage is excellent.

* F+1+4 (big; not a true combo)
This only works on big characters and even then it is technically not
a true combo because the opponent can tech roll after landing.  However,
the unblockable is difficult if not impossible to avoid since Michelle
is already dashing by then and her unblockable will track the opponent.
Because this is so effective, this is probably the best followup after
a class 1 launcher due to the ease of use and damage.

<untechable>
Below is another juggle that can be used after Devil's Devil Twister,
Jack-2's Discharger, or P.Jack's Drill Upper.  All of these launchers
are class 1 and the opponent cannot tech roll after landing.

* F+1+4 (big)
This will inflict more damage than most if not all of Michelle's
other juggles, so if you are fighting a big guy, this is THE move
you should use.  Needless to say, this is very easy to do.

-----------------

Michelle has several moves that will cause a double-over stun.  Assuming
the opponent does not escape the stun, Michelle has many juggles to
choose from; she can do any of the standard class 2 juggles and then
some.  The first hit of the juggle should connect while the opponent
is starting to fall back, so the opponent will be in the air after the
attack hits.

* 1+2
This is very easy to do but the damage is not the best.

* uf+3+4 (not a true combo)
Even though this is technically not a true combo, the opponent cannot
roll away in time to avoid it if the Foot Stomp is done quickly enough.
This is relatively easy to do, and the damage is good.  Be careful if
your opponent can break out of the stun, since you must execute the
Foot Stomp immediately and hope your opponent does not break out of
the stun.  If the stun is broken, your opponent will have more than
enough time to punish Michelle once she lands.

The Rapid Counter Attack can substitue the first elbow in the Party
Crasher juggles, and it does a bit more damage.  Otherwise, these
are much the same as the standard multi-elbow juggles.

34    ...d+1, FC,df+4,3, f,f+1,4
-----------------

These combos can be used on opponents reeling from block stun or,
in the case on heavy opponents, after getting hit by launcher that
merely staggers them.  The first hit of the combo will knock the
stunned opponent into the air for full damage, and the rest of the
hits will juggle.

The only move Michelle has that will cause block stun long enough such
that an attack can hit is the generic cross chop while running or
tagging in, and the cross chop needs to hit as late as possible.
Against heavy opponents, some of Michelle's launchers, most notably
1~1,1, f+1, and SS+3,4 do not launch (unless a tag was buffered in
taggable launchers) if the launcher connects.  Instead, the opponent
is knocked off balance for a moment.  If a followup attack connects
before the opponent recovers fully, the opponent will be knocked into
the air and can be juggled.  While the opponent is recovering, he
cannot neutral guard attacks.  I do not know if the opponent can
active block attacks (i.e., hold back) while recovering.

Michelle's unblockable works like a class 1 launcher for her, and she
has a greater selection of juggles to choose from.  My juggle of choice,
if I want the most damage, is one of the UF,4 juggles.

* SS+3,4, f,f+1,4
I first saw this in a Castel movie.  This is a nice combo that is good
for show off, and the damage is good.  Depending on how close you are,
you just might be able to squeeze in another hit (e.g., another elbow)
before the Party Crasher.  Since Michelle cannot sidestep while tagging
in until it is too late, she cannot do this fancy juggle after any class
1 tag launcher.  In other words, she can only do this juggle after her
unblockable.

-----------------

Against normal-sized opponents, these launchers will launch to class 2
height.  However, Michelle is often too far away to connect with a left
jab or low jab, so she has fewer reliable juggles.

Against a heavier opponent, these launchers will only stagger the
opponent most of the time, and the above juggles will not work.
However, if you are close and fast enough, a jab might hit the
opponent before he recovers from the stagger and knock him off
his feet.  If you manage to do this, you can juggle.

-----------------

Michelle's basic standing right kick knocks the opponent away on a
counterhit.  While the opponent is in the air, Michelle can connect
with a Party Crasher or Rapid Counter Attack.  Comments:

* f,F+1, f,F+1, d+4,1
* f,F+1, f,F+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,4
Same as the class 3 elbow juggles.  To connect with the first elbow,
you need to input the elbow quickly as soon as Michelle recovers, and
the elbow needs to be dash buffered about a half step.  Because you
need not put the stick into neutral before pressing 1, these combos
are slightly easier to do with Michelle than with Julia.

* d,DF+1, f,f+1, d+4,1
The Rapid Counter Attack does more damage than the Party Crasher.
Since Michelle recovers from d,DF+1 faster than Julia, she has
an easier time adding extra hits, so you might as well try.
Otherwise, same old elbow juggles.

-----------------

After a counterhit Machine Gun Cannon or Slow Power Punch Combo,
the opponent is popped up high and away.  After Michelle recovers,
she can run forward to juggle her opponent with elbows, or she can
try to connect with the Lashing Arrow.  (Out of numerous attempts
with the Lashing Arrow, I only connected with it once.)  Comments:

* f,f+2
This is difficult to connect, and this is not the best juggle Michelle
can do.  If I am playing to win, I do not even think about trying this.
This is only mentioned by Julia cannot do this.

* f,F+1,4
* f,F+1, f,f+1, d+4,1
* f,F+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,4
* f,F+1, d,DF+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, d,DF+1
These are similar to the standard elbow juggles.  To connect with the
first elbow, tap forward twice and hold forward after the second tap
for a brief moment to dash buffer the elbow.  While running, if you
wait too long to start the first elbow, you will do a basic left jab,
which may or may not hit.

If the Thrust Fist counterhits, the opponent will be in a double over

-----------------

Michelle can play dead just like Julia (i.e., not very well).  If the
3 connects on a clean hit or counterhit, Michelle's opponent will be
tripped and can be juggled.  This is the only way Michelle can start
a low float juggle.  Comments:

* f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,4
* f,f+1, f,f+1, d+4,1
* f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, d,DF+1
These are the same standard elbow juggles.  In this case, any one
of them is dependable.

* [d+1_d+2_FC+4,] FC,df+4,3
Because Michelle recovers crouching, she can easily start a Spinning
Sweep Combo juggle immediately.  The low jab or low kick before the
Spinning Sweep Combo is not needed, but it adds a little extra damage
and may lift the opponent a bit higher.  Since the opponent is not in
the air as high, it is tougher to connect with anything after the
Spinning Sweep Combo before the opponent touches the ground and can
techroll.

After the Skyscraper Kick connects, the opponent will be knocked
down to ground and cannot quick recover.  While the opponent is down,
Michelle has few guaranteed followups that will add a little more damage.
If you know the opponent will try to get up immediately, you can use
Party Crasher juggles instead, and such juggles will hit if the first
elbow connects.  Comments:

* d+3
This is the fastest and easiest followup.  It also does slightly more
damage than the d+4 sweep alone.

* d+4,1 (not a true combo)
This is a bit slower, but the sweep is guaranteed to hit.  If the
opponent tries to get up when the sweep hits, the uppercut will hit
as well.  The uppercut also advances Michelle toward the opponent,
which is good if it hits, but bad if it misses.

* d+4,N+4 (not a true combo)
This is nearly the same as Razor's Edge.  The only difference is the
last hit is a right kick instead of an uppercut.  The right kick does
slightly more damage than the uppercut, and it does not advance Michelle
much so it is safe to use in case the opponent stays down.  The only
problem with this is I find it easy to do a low kick (d+4,d+4) instead
during the heat of battle, which will miss unless the opponent is big,
and even if it hits, the low kick does less damage.

* f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1,4 (big)

* f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, d,DF+1,2 (big)

can be hit by the elbow -- it will miss smaller characters.

-----------------

The Skyscraper Kick after the Party Crasher recovers a bit faster than
the stand-alone Skyscraper Kick.  Because of this, the elbow juggles can
work on anyone, but they will require precision timing against smaller
characters.  The juggles will work easily against big characters.

If the Snake Step connects, Michelle will have an advantage lasting
11 frames.  This is long enough for a few attacks to hit guaranteed.

* WS+1
If you are unsure that SS+2 will connect, this is a safe attack
to use.  If SS+2 is blocked, WS+1 is relatively safe even if blocked.
If SS+2 hits, so will WS+1.

* WS+4, <any WS+4 juggle>
If you know SS+2 will be a sure hit, use this.  The Skyscraper Kick
is Michelle's most damaging followup that is guaranteed to hit, and
Michelle can juggle after it.


-----------------
3.4.2. Tag Combos

Tag juggles are useful because they do more damage to the red life bar,
leaving the opponent less life to regenerate.  Anytime you connect with
a tag launcher, and your partner can juggle well after it, tag out and
let your partner finish the juggle.

-----------------

20    ...f,f,N+4,4,4 (Alex/Roger, Armor King, or King only)
-----------------

After a Tequlia Sunrise Combo, the opponent staggers back a bit before
falling down.  Michelle cannot followup with anything guaranteed by
herself, so her only juggle option is to tag out and let her partner
finish the combo.  The only followups that can hit are either a tag
slide or Ali Kicks.

* f,f,N+4
For most characters, this will do a tag slide.  Damage from the slide
may not be very much, but it is better than nothing.  A few characters
will do something other than a slide, which may or may not hit.

* f,f,N+4,4,4 (Alex/Roger, Armor King, or King only)
If Michelle's partner is Alex/Roger, Armor King, or King; they will
do Ali Kicks instead.  This does more damage than a tag slide.

Against normal-sized opponents, these are Michelle's class 2 tag
launchers.  If the opponent is heavy, these become class 3 tag
launchers.  The G-Clef Cannon is Michelle best tag launcher.  Tiger's
Claw is another useful tag launcher because it will hit opponents who
try to use high attacks against Michelle.  Her Ultimate Cannon can tag
launch, but it is so slow that using it will only get Michelle killed.
After the tag, Michelle's partner can finish off the launcher with a
juggle.

These tag launchers put the opponent up and away, and Michelle can juggle

does good damage, but you need to be fast for it to connect.  The slide
does less damage, but it is easier to combo with.

Ouch -- this hurts!  The total damage from the throw and stomp is
very good.

This is fast and easy, but it is nowhere near as damaging as the
Foot Stomp.  If the diagonals are bad, you may be stuck with this.

The tag slide will hit, and it is more damaging than a d+3, but the

After Wang tags out from the Waning Moon, the opponent may be low to
the ground and can recover crouching.  Most of Michelle's best attacks
are either too slow or will miss the opponent, so Michelle does not
have much to attack the opponent with.

* d+3
This is the easiest followup, but the damage is low.

* f,f,N+4
This is probably the best guaranteed move Michelle can do.  After the
slide, Michelle can get up with a 3 sweep (which is not guaranteed).

* f,f,N+1+2 (blocked), <any block stun combo>
This is tougher to do, but the damage is good -- better than the above
options.  Either the cross chop will hit the opponent for good damage,
or the opponent will block it, then be open to a possible juggle for
even more damage because of block stun.  While the opponent staggers,
you can juggle the opponent with any block stun combo.


//-------------------//
//  3.5. Strategies  //
//-------------------//

--------------
3.5.1. Defense

As for moves like reversals or parries, Michelle has none except for
the universal low parry.  Because of this, Michelle will need to block,
sidestep, or interrupt attacks to defend herself.  Fortunately for
Michelle, her sidestep has good range, and she has lightning fast
attacks like G-Clef Cannon or Party Crasher to stop incoming attacks.
Interrupting attacks is Michelle's best defense anyway.  Michelle
can take away about a third of a life bar or more with combos that
start with an 8 frame jab that counterhits.  If you think about it,
that is a great advantage.

Michelle does have one move to help her avoid attacks -- her backflip.
This lets her retreat quickly, and it is great if you need some space.
Because of her speed and mobility, Michelle does not need a reversal
to bail her out if she gets into trouble.

Unlike Julia, Michelle only has the universal low parry to stop
incoming low attacks.  If you have trouble tapping the diagonal
at the precise moment, here is a tip (that I learned from one of
Reverend C's faqs) that can help.  You can put Michelle into a
crouch, and while she is crouching, roll the joystick to the diagonal
(much like doing one of the Changs' FC moves) as the attack is about
to hit Michelle.  That should parry the attack.  This is easy to do
on Kings' Ali Kicks or Jacks' Cossack Kicks.

As with Julia, you should parry only if the benefits are better
than if you merely blocked or evaded the attack.

Example when low parry is the best option.
* Julia is using the Tequila Sunrise Low Kick strings (WS+2,4,...).
  If you low parry the sweep, you not only have a big enough opening
  to start a combo, but also you prevented a nasty mixup.

Example when low parry is NOT the best option.
* You are fighting Jun, and you know the player will use Can Can Kicks.
  The first hit is low, and the second hit is high.  If you low parry
  the first kick, Jun will be vulnerable, but a hop kick will miss her,
  and you are limited to fast but weak moves that cannot start combos.
  If you block the low kick, the second kick will pass over Michelle's
  head and Jun is wide open to many things (e.g., hop kick) while she
  is recovering.

Below is a list of low kick attacks that if parried put the opponent
too far away to be hit by the Changs' hop kick.  In such cases, a
Party Crasher or some other swift mid attack must be used instead
if you want to inflict damage after a successful low parry.

Bruce:   3,2,1,4
Eddy:    any low attack except first hit of 3~4
Jin:     b+2,4,4,4
Jun:     any low attack (especially can-can kicks or leg cutter sweeps)
Kazuya:  db+4 or 1,2,4 (any stature kick)

3.5.2. Sidestep

Michelle has a good sidestep, and with all of her powerful sidestep
moves, it is important to sidestep the opponent when you see a chance.
When you anticipate an attack, you can sidestep to avoid it then punish
the opponent during recovery.  Generally, left limb attacks are avoided
more easily if you sidestep to the left, and similarly, right limb
attacks are avoided more easily if you sidestep to the right.
Be careful, some moves can track (e.g., Nina's Blonde Bomb) or have
excellent lateral range (e.g., sweeps) on one or both sides and can
be sidestepped in one direction only or cannot be avoided at all by
sidestepping.  Below are some things you can do if you manage to
sidestep your opponent.

* throw
The throw is the easiest and most obvious followup.  Depending how far
the opponent advanced, you may get a back throw or a side throw.  Back
throw is inescapable, but the side throws can be escaped.  Either way,
Michelle's throws are not that great, and she has more powerful
alternatives.

* 3+4
If you just sidestepped to the right and you want to go directly behind
your opponent (for a back throw), you can make Michelle spin to augment
her sidestep.  This is only useful if the opponent did a slow move or
is winding up for an unblockable.

* SS+1
If you want to knock the opponent down and away, this will do it.
The damage is paltry though.  This is also one of Michelle's best
anti-sidestep moves; use it to stop sidestepping opponents dead
in their tracks.

* SS+2
This is neither as fast nor as damaging as Twin Waking Kicks, but it
is a very safe move to use since the Michelle has no disadvantage
if it is blocked, and Michelle has guaranteed followups if it hits.

* SS+3,4
This is the best move you can do.  The kicks themselves do good
damage and they launch.  Follow up with a juggle for even more damage.
Total damage from the kicks and juggle do more damage than any of
Michelle's throws.


---------------
3.5.3. Throwing

Throws are useful since they are generally easy to do and inflict
good damage.  They are unblockable, but they can be crouched under
or escaped.  When you are close to your opponent and see a chance,
go for the throw if you feel like it.  Throws are also useful as a
retaliation move sometimes, especially if your opponent has a chance
of blocking any other move you try.  Do not try to throw with reckless
abandon though, you can be punished after a missed throw attempt, and
some characters such as Jin can punish severely.

Buffering is often used to make throw inputs more efficient.  You
can attack with something that uses one or more buttons needed by
the throw, hold those buttons down, quickly input stick motions if
necessary, then press the remaining button(s).  Here is an example;
press and hold 1 to jab, then press 3 to throw.  Now for another
example; press and hold 2 to jab, then quickly tap df+1.  This will
cause Michelle to use the Arm Lock Suplex.

Although Michelle is not as good a grappler as Julia, she does have
enough throws to be complete.  Her basic throws are more-or-less
standard and she has one command throw that requires a double
button escape.  Like Julia, Michelle can use fast moves to setup
and buffer throws.


-------------
3.5.4. Poking

Poking is attacking your opponent with moves that execute and recover
quickly.  The purpose of poking is to attack quickly while minimizing
exposure to your opponent's attacks.  Poking can be used to interrupt
your opponent's attack and possibly shift the attack momentum to your
favor.  Poking can also be used to setup more powerful attacks.

Michelle is fast and can poke fairly well.  Her pokes are great for
interrupting her opponent's attack because some of them can chain
into big damage strings and/or launchers that are guaranteed if they
counterhit.  Also, some of her poking moves allow Michelle to recover
crouching.  What is the benefit for Michelle recovering in a crouch?
Michelle has several powerful moves that attack at varying hit levels,
and increases the chance that your opponent will block incorrectly
and take damage.  From a crouch, Michelle can do a Spinning Sweep
Combo, Body Elbow, Skyscraper Kick, or any of the Tequila Sunrise
strings.

* 1
One of Michelle's easiest pokes is a simple jab.  It has decent range
and it is fast.  While it is among the fastest in execution, it does not
give Michelle any frame advantage after it is blocked unlike some other
characters.  Still, you can throw one out at a standing opponent without
much fear of retaliation.  Use it to setup more powerful attacks.
I use it often for two reasons:  to goad my opponent into attacking
so I can interrupt (or trade hits at worst) the attack with 1~1,1 or
1~2~1, or to tick and sometimes buffer a throw.

* d+1
This jab is fast and it is great for poking or interrupting attacks.
In addition, Michelle recovers crouching.  From here, she can poke some
more or use one of her powerful FC or WS moves.  One thing you need
to watch out for is Michelle (or anyone else) is vulnerable to high
attacks, especially throws, while jabbing low.

* 2
While slightly slower than her left jab, this is useful because if
this connects (i.e., not blocked), the opponent is at a 9 frame
disadvantage, and Michelle can easily buffer a throw and grab the
opponent.  The throw is not guaranteed to connect, but the opponent
cannot interrupt it.

* 1~1[,1_4]
* 1~2[~1_3_4]
* df+1[,1_4]
* WS+2,1[,1_4]
Despite relatively long recovery time if blocked, these shortened strings
are important poking tools because of mixup options.  Unless you become
predictable, your opponent will not attack you after the string (usually)
because of timing differences and the opponent's counterattack would be
eaten up by your string in case you did the entire string.  In addition,
some of the strings have low sweeps, and can hit the opponent for minor
damage.  Remember though, 1~1,4 will miss Ganryu.

* 4
Her basic right kick is fast and relatively safe to use.  Think of
it as a jab with somewhat less speed but with more power and reach.
What is great about this is not only its speed, but also it can start
juggles if it counterhits.

* 4,4[,d+4_N+4_1]
These are her Spinning Kicks strings.  The first two kicks are fast,
but are slow enough for experienced and quick thinking players to block
or parry the second kick, which hits low.  Still, unless your opponent
is really good, the first two kicks alone is a useful poke that can
connect at times.  After the low kick, Michelle can stop or add one of
three enders.  If you stop at the low kick, Michelle recovers crouching,
and you can continue with one of several of her FC or WS moves.
If you choose to add an ender, use either the low kick or the uppercut.
Of the enders, the low kick is the safest.  Since many people do not
want to take the chance of getting hit by the uppercut, they tend to
block high and eat the low kick, resulting in minor damage.  Michelle
also recovers crouching if the low kick ender was used.  However, if you
think the opponent might try to block low, go ahead and use the uppercut
ender.  If the uppercut connects, use your class 2 juggle of choice.
Watch out though, if the opponent blocks the uppercut, you will be in
a world of hurt.

* d+4[,d+4_N+4_1]
This is the sweep that preceeds one of three enders.  While it does not
come out as quickly as some of Michelle 's other punches or kicks, the
first kick hits low, and Michelle recovers crouching.  Again, Michelle
has her mixup options from the crouch.  If only the first sweep is used,
its recovery is long enough to allow your opponent's fastest attacks
to connect regardless if the sweep hits.  However, it is unlikely your
opponent will try to counterattack since Michelle can add the ender.
See the Spinning Kick strings above regarding the enders.

* FC+4
This is Michelle's fastest attack that hits low.  It does not have
much range, and unlike some characters, Michelle must be in a full
crouch before she can use this.  It is still useful as its recovery
is relatively short, and it is fast enough to interrupt some strings
(like Eddy's).  After the kick, Michelle remains crouching.

* d+3
This is a bit slow for a poke, but this sweep hits low (and grounded),
and it is her fastest low attack while Michelle is standing.  After the
sweep, Michelle recovers crouching.  The lag is relatively long if it
blocked, so make sure it hits if you plan to use this as a poking
weapon.  Do NOT abuse this!  Your opponent may fall for it once,
maybe twice (for minor damage), but if it is blocked or parried just
once, you will be sorry.

* d,DF+1
The dashing left punch from this move has fast execution and good range.
Michelle recovers very quickly from the punch, and she can followup
with more attacks.  If the punch hits, the opponent will be knocked
down.

* FC,df+4[,3]
This is the first hit of the Spinning Sweep Combo.  It strikes low
and it is often hard to spot the sweep in time before it hits.  After
recovering, Michelle remains crouching.  Anytime Michelle is crouching
and near her opponent, she can attack with the sweep to chip away life,
and Michelle can easily repeat this or do something else.  Know that
if the sweep is blocked, the opponent has enough time to hit Michelle
with something fast.

* df+4
Michelle does a fast toe kick that hits mid.  It is one of her
fastest mid attacks, and the recovery is minimal.

* f,f+1[,4]
Michelle's Party Crasher is very fast and has minimal lag.  It can
be used to close in on her opponent or to counter incoming attacks.
Because the elbow is very fast, it will beat out almost anything the
opponent tries.  If the elbow counterhits, the skyscraper kick is
guaranteed to hit and juggles are possible.  If the elbow is blocked,
lag is minimal.  This can be used to setup throws or other attacks.
Below is list of some things you can do after a blocked elbow.  After
a blocked elbow, if you think the opponent will try to...
  ...counterattack with a move slower than 10 frames, go for the
       kill and counter with 1~1,1 or 1~2~1.
  ...counterattack with an 8 frame move that hits high, you can
       do a Flash Uppercut or Tiger's Claw.  Either move will evade
       your opponent's high attack and launch the opponent.
  ...counterattack with any 8 frame move, use the Skyscraper Kick
       ender.
  ...stand there and block or use a reversal or punch parry, grab
       him or her.  (Arm Lock Suplex is best if Michelle is close
       enough to her opponent.)
  ...crouch, do any of the following:  Skyscraper Kick ender,
       another elbow, hop kick, or a Slow Power Punch Combo.

* SS+1
While not the fastest mid attack Michelle has, the Burning Palm Crush
is relatively fast.  Due to its hit area and speed, it is effective
against opponents who sidestep.

* SS+2[~1]
The Snake Step is a very powerful poking tool.  Although it executes
a bit slow for a poke and it requires a sidestep, its recovery is
excellent and puts Michelle into a crouch (and you know what that
means).  If the Snake Step is blocked, Michelle has no disadvantage
and she can attack again immediately.  If the Snake Step hits,
Michelle has an excellent frame advantage and some attacks (like
the Skyscraper Kick) are guaranteed to hit in the meantime.  In
case you abuse the Snake Step and your opponent wises up, you can
do the Inner Palm Crush instead, which looks like the Snake Step
during its execution.

* d,DF+2
This is more of a long range keep away move.  You can use this to
peck at someone from afar.  If it is blocked, the opponent is pushed
back far away.


Related to poking is custom strings.  A custom string is a string
of moves that seem to flow seamlessly from move to move.  Each move
within the custom string, with the possible exception the ender,
should have fast execution and recovery times; the less frames, the
better.  Basically, it is a string of pokes that may end with a power
move.  Such strings are useful for chipping away your opponent's life
bit by bit or for setting up a variety of moves such as throws.
Below are a few examples.

Example #1:
f,f+1, d+1, FC,df+4,3.

Michelle starts with a fast recovering Party Crasher elbow.  After that,
uses a quick low jab to get into a crouch.  While crouching, Michelle
quickly does the Sweeping Sweep Combo.

Example #2:
f,f+1, d+1, f,f+1.

Same as the above example except for the Party Crasher after the low
jab.  If the opponent tried to block low, the elbow will knock the
opponent down.  If the opponent blocks the elbow, you can do something
else.  Below are some options:
   f,f+1, d+1, f,f+1,4.
     Skyscraper Kick will snuff your opponent's counterattack,
     and you can juggle if it hits.

   f,f+1, d+1, f,f+1, f+1.
     The Flash Uppercut will evade high attacks and launch the
     opponent if he or she tries to jab high.  (Useful against
     other Chang players who think they can 1~1,1 you first.)
     Alternately, you can use Michelle's df+3+4 instead.

   f,f+1, d+1, f,f+1, df+1+2.
     This will grab the opponent if he or she just stands there.

   f,f+1, d+1, f,f+1, d+1, ....
     Infinite custom string.  Not recommended but shown as an example.

Example #3:
4,4, WS+2,1[,4], f,F,N+1.

Michelle quickly does a high kick then low kick.  After the low kick,
Michelle is crouching.  Next, Michelle does a partial Tequila Sunrise
string.  After that, Michelle closes back in with the Party Crasher.
See example #2 for some possible extensions.


--------------
3.5.5. Okizeme

Okizeme is loosely defined as attacking your opponent while he/she is
down on the ground.  While Michelle has good attacks to knock opponents
trying to get up back down, she does not have any fast and powerful
attacks to hit opponents who insist on staying down unless the opponent
is big.  Below is a list of useful attacks for okizeme.

* d+1
If the opponent is rolling toward Michelle from a distance, this can
interrupt whatever attacks the opponent tries.  This can pop such
a rolling opponent into the air and you can juggle.

* d+3
Of the moves she has that can hit grounded opponents, this sweep has
the fastest execution time.  It will knock the opponent away and give
him or her time to get up, but at least you will inflict some damage,
and it is the safest attack you can use.

* d+4,[N+4_1]
Like d+3, this will hit grounded opponents.  This does not come out
as quickly as d+3, but it recovers a bit faster, and Michelle has the
option of following up with an high kick or uppercut.  Either followup
is guaranteed if the sweep hits when the opponent tries to get up.
The uppercut ender is useful when you know the opponent will try to
get up because it leaves Michelle close to her opponent and she can
continue with okizeme.  However, if the opponent stays down and the
uppercut misses, Michelle is open to attack.  High kick ender does
slightly more damage, but the opponent will not be close to Michelle
and he or she can get up safely.  When in doubt, use the high kick
ender.  If it misses, Michelle is safe.  If it hits, it does good
damage.  Of course, if you know the opponent will stay down, just
do the first sweep alone then run after the opponent.

* FC,df+4,3
If Michelle is crouching, the Spinning Sweep Combo is one of the best
moves she can do.  It advances Michelle and if it hits the opponent
while he/she is trying to get up, it will hit and float the opponent.
While the opponent is floating, Michelle can either juggle or wait
until the opponent lands then attack when the opponent tries to get
up again.  If your opponent refuses to get up, you can either use the
sweep only to inflict damage safely or wait for the opponent to move
then try to catch him or her.  If you choose to wait, you risk getting
hit by a quick attack from your opponent.

* f,f+1
The Party Crasher can hit an opponent rolling forward or backward,
and possibly float him or her for a possible juggle.

* F+1+4
Her unblockable is guaranteed to hit big characters on the ground,
and it inflicts heavy damage.  Because of its range, the opponent
will have to move quickly to stand a chance of avoiding it.  Smaller
characters can avoid it by just lying still on ground, but if they
flinch in any way, they are vulnerable too.


--------------
3.5.6. Chicken

A "chicken" is a reversal to attack reversals.  Anytime you use a high
or mid punch or kick against a character with attack reversals (Anna,
Jin, Jun, Nina, Paul, or Wang), you should always buffer a chicken if
possible.  Since the Changs are offensive characters, chickens are
very important if you want to stay on the offense against characters
endowed with attack reversals.  A chicken damages your opponent and
shifts the momentum to your favor.

Generally, to chicken an attack, press f+1+3 for left attacks or f+2+4
for right attacks right before or at the moment your opponent tries to
reverse your attack.  Michelle has a few attacks with a non-obvious
chicken input.  Twin Arrow, which uses both punch buttons and appears
to use both hands at once, is treated as a left attack and is chickened
with f+1+3.  Even though the Thrust Fist uses both hands, it uses only
the right punch button and is chickened with f+2+4 like other right
attacks.  Her Heavy Uppercut unblockable is treated as a right attack
and is chickened with f+2+4 even though she uppercuts with her left
hand; the reversing character uses a right punch reversal animation
after reversing the Heavy Uppercut.

Some of Michelle's strings, notably 1~1,..., 1~2,..., or 4,4,... strings,
are hard to buffer chickens for the first hit because the input for the
whole string must be done quickly.  My advice is do not use the full
string if you think your opponent will reverse the first hit as you will
likely be caught trying to finish the string if the first attack gets
reversed.  Instead, use either the first hit only, or use the slower
starting alternate versions of those strings (e.g., df+1,... df+2,...,
or d+4,...).  In the case of the slower starting strings, you should
have time to input the whole string before you need to buffer a chicken
for the first hit.

Quick chicken note:
Attack reversed          Escape
-------------------------------
left limb              -- f+1+3
right limb             -- f+2+4
1+2 (Twin Arrow)       -- f+1+3
F+1+4 (Heavy Uppercut) -- f+2+4


--------------------------
3.5.7. Supercharger Tricks

When Michelle is supercharged, her moves will inflict guard damage if
they are blocked, or will counterhit on any hit.  Below are some tips
that can help you use the supercharger wisely.

Because of the time it takes to supercharge, you should only use the
supercharger when it is safe to do it.  One occasion to supercharge
is after you knock the opponent down and away from Michelle (e.g.,
after CH Twin Arrow).  By the time the opponent recovers, Michelle
will be supercharged.

If your opponent has only a tiny sliver of life left, the guard damage
from a blocked supercharged attack can K.O. the opponent.  Since the
Party Crasher and Rapid Counter Attack have excellent speed and reach,
it will beat out many of your opponents' attacks, and they are the
best attacks Michelle can use for this purpose.  The Thrust Fist is
also useful because it has long range and it stuns on a counterhit.

One more thing about supercharger:  Michelle can supercharge, tag in
her partner and her partner will be supercharged; and vice versa.
You can tag when you anticipate an attack, then punish the opponent
during recovery.


//---------------------//
//  3.6. Tag Partners  //
//---------------------//

A good partner for Michelle is someone who can take advantage her
strengths, cover her weaknesses, and most importantly, hold his or
her own in case Michelle gets hurt badly and needs to rest.  Below
is a general and rather simple-minded list of pros and cons of each
character, followed by a small list of recommended partners.  Even
though some characters are more powerful and/or tag combo friendly
than others, everyone is strong enough to win.  (That is why I
removed the character evaluations present in previous versions
of this guide.)

Michelle has good speed and some nice launchers.  However, Michelle
has poor stamina and no very powerful juggles after a class 2 launcher
(although she is no slouch at juggling).  Her most damaging juggles
require a class 1 launcher.  She can use a tough, strong partner that
has a good class 1 launcher and/or powerful class 2 juggles.


Alex/Roger

Cons:  Poor reach; low stamina; mediocre class 2 juggling ability;
         awkward tag launcher.

Angel/Devil
Pros:  Mishima moves (i.e., flash punches, crouch dash, WGF, hell sweeps,
         tsunami kicks, and stone head throw); standing twin pistons;
         powerful SS class 1 launcher; high stamina.

         "haha" backstep is used); powerful and easy ch 4 juggles.
Cons:  Damaging tag juggles are not easy to do.

Moku/Tetsujin
Pros:  Can mimic most characters; inherits most characters' strengths
         (and weaknesses).

PART IV:  Miscellaneous

//--------------------------//
//  4.1. Julia or Michelle  //
//--------------------------//

Despite their similar moveset and size, both Changs' cannot be played
exactly the same way; that is if you want to get the best results with
either Julia or Michelle.  Each Chang has distinct advantages over the
other.  You might ask which Chang is better?  IMO, both are about equal,
as their advantages seem to balance each other out.  If you want a
brawler or a strong juggler, Julia is for you.  If you want a dancing,
hit-and-run poker, Michelle is for you.  Below I will list and explain
the advantages of Julia and Michelle.  (Personally, I like Julia more
than Michelle.)

Advantages of Julia
-------------------
* Better throws
* More stamina
* Stronger juggles

Advantages of Michelle
----------------------
* Better poking
* Better sidestep attacks
* Easier combos
* Greater mobility


--------------------------
4.1.1. Advantages of Julia

Julia is the "brawler" of the two Changs.  Below is a brief description
of Julia's advantages over Michelle.

Better throws:  Some of Julia's basic throws are more damaging than
Michelle's (by five points).  Also, Julia has more damaging and
effective command throws, and she can blend them into her poking
strings more easily than Michelle.  Her Mad Axes has fast execution
and good reach, and it does good damage.  Julia also has a throw that
is done from a full crouch.

More Stamina:  Julia has 8% more hit points than Michelle.  Enough said.

Stronger juggles:  Julia's class 2 juggles are among the strongest in
the game.  Julia can make the opponent really pay if he or she gets
launched, and she is a great partner to those with highly effective
tag launchers.


-----------------------------
4.1.2. Advantages of Michelle

Michelle is the "dancer" of the two Changs.  Below is a brief
description of Michelle's advantages over Julia.

Better poking:  Michelle has stronger poking options.  Michelle's
Party Crasher can start combos if the elbow counterhits.  Most of
Michelle's sidestep attacks are effective pokes, and some of them
are effective combos starters as well.  Michelle also has more
effective long range poking attacks than Julia as well.

Better sidestep attacks:  Nearly all of Michelle's sidestep attacks
are useful.  SS+1 is a fast mid attack that clogs sidestepping opponents
and knocks them down, SS+2 is an excellent poke that can start combos,
and SS+3,4 is a powerful launcher.  All of them are relatively safe.

Easier combos:  Michelle has more fast combo starters than Julia.  Her
Party Crasher can start combos if the elbow counterhits.  Tiger's Claw
evades high attacks and launches anything for a juggle.  Her sidestep
attacks can also start combos rather easily.  In addition to easier
combo starters, Michelle has easier elbow juggles.  She cannot delay
the recovery of the Party Crasher elbow, which means you do not need
to move the stick to neutral after each double forward tap, which Julia
must do.  This makes juggles that require dash buffered elbows easier.

Greater mobility:  Her backflip can move Michelle away from danger
quickly.  Michelle can also attack on the move more effectively than
Julia.  For example, SS+2 advances Michelle and puts her into a crouch;
and d,DF+2 is a good medium to long range attack.  Ultimately, this is
what compensates her relatively small arms and legs.


//----------------------------//
//  4.2. Tag Class 2 Juggles  //

PART V:  Credits
===========================================================================

Namco - For making the Tekken games.

Jason Arney - For buffering tips on Julia's Mad Axes throw.

"Castel" - For his excellent Tekken Zaibatsu site.  Also for showing
  me the differences between moves involving Julia's right elbow.

"Catlord" - For the handy TTT movelists.

"Tragic" - For his Tekken 3 manual.  From there, I learned that the
  Changs' Heavy Uppercut is reversed/chickened as a right attack.
  Also for his Tekken 3 Yoshimitsu manual.  I learned a few useful
  Yoshi tag juggles from there.

"Patrick" - For the info in his TTT "New Moves List" faq (which is
  now obsolete due to the newer info at Tekken Zaibatsu).

"Reverend C." - Out of all the TTT faqs I read, his Heihachi, Kazuya,
  and Nina guides were the most helpful in helping me write this guide.
  I used them as a template of sorts.  All of his TTT guides are good
  reading as well.  Also for some feedback and tips.

"abrar" - I also borrowed some writing techniques, mainly the movelist
  format, from his TTT Kuma guide.  His Kuma guide is worth reading as
  well.

"Renick" - I learned a few Bryan and Ogre tag juggles from his faqs.

"Joshic" - His Tekken 3 Ling faq helped me learn how to use Ling
  and do some of her juggles.

"jjt" - I learned some Chang combos, namely juggles after f,f+1,4
  and b+4, SSR, ..., from some of his posts on the Zaibatsu forum.

"HAN" - For Wang's Waning Moon/tag cross chop combos.

"MC" - For the 4,4,1 tip against backturned opponents.

"Ug the Caveman" - For encouraging me to finish writing this guide,
  providing damage values for the Changs' basic moves (before Zaibatsu
  got them), for Michelle's Tiger's Claw, Spinning Kicks combo against
  big characters, and for teaching me some tag juggles for the big guys
  and Baek.


Below are some sites that helped me write this guide:

http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com
  The best and most informative TTT site IMO.  I got the frame data
  and some damage values from there.  The site even has a forum.

http://www.tekkentagtournament.com
  Namco's TTT site.  I got the move names and most of the damage
  values from there as well as some tips from the forum (during
  the days before Tekken Zaibatsu opened its forum).

http://www.gamefaqs.com
  Has a great collection of FAQs and the like.
