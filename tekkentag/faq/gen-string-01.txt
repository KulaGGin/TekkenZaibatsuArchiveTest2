= What Is This? =
=================

Welcome to the Tekken Tag Tournament 10-String Avoidance FAQ.  This FAQ will 
detail how to block/avoid destruction by character's 10-hit string.  I will not 
detail everything in a character's hit strings.  I will only give you enough 
detail to get by without misblocking.  In future revisions, I may include more 
advanced topics including all possible reversal/parry points.  I assume you know 
how to play TTT so I'm not going to include some fancy introduction to this 
section.  Let's get to the crux of the matter, shall we?

For the charts I will be using in this FAQ (known as blocking charts), this is 
what each number or letter will mean:

0-9 = Block high (hit is always mid or high in that circumstance)
L = Block low (hit is either high or low but never mid in that circumstance)
: = End of string
/,\,- = Possible string paths

Outside of the blocking chart, assume standard numerical Tekken notation unless 
otherwise specified.  Here is an example of a blocking chart:

1-L-3-4-5-L-7-L-L-0:

This chart is indicating that you should block low at hits 2, 6, 8, and 9 (the 
L's) because those hits regardless of the string are either high or low but 
NEVER mid.  If the move is actually low, you can parry it.  If the move is high, 
chances are you can crouch and counter pretty easily.  For the other hits 
listed as numbers, always block high as the move is always mid or high.  With 
that said, let's look at the individual characters who have hit strings.

========================
= Jin Kazama/Devil Jin =
========================

Jin has the most hit strings in the game.  He can do 5, 8, 9, 10, or 11 hit 
strings IIRC.  However, you can use process of elimination to determine what 
string Jin might do simply by looking at the first two hits.  He has four string 
starters:

Punch-Kick
Kick-Punch
Punch-Punch
Devil Jin only

Here are the charts and the explanation for each set:

                       4-5:        L-1:
                      /           /  
JIN PUNCH KICK = 1-2-3-L-5-6-L-8-9-0-1:
                                    \ 
                                     L:

If he starts with a punch kick combo, one of two things can happen:

1) Jump Kick: If he leaves the ground, attempt an attack reversal or throw a 
jab.  This is the best way to stop the jump kick string.  If you miss that 
reversal/punch at hit 3, block low at hit 4 and then block high and attempt 
another reversal at hit 5.  After that, hit 7 is low.  He throws high moves for 
hits 8 and 9 so try to stop him there (crouch and counter) because at hit 10, he 
can go mid (Thunder God Fist) or low (Can-Can Kicks).  If hit 10 gets you, then 
it won't matter what hit 11 because you will be juggled.  If you do block hit 
10, he can still mix it up if he went for the Thunder God Fist.  

2) If he does a punch (Laser Cannon) after the punch kick opening, simply block 
high until hit 5.  The combo ends there.

                                 L:
                                / 
JIN KICK PUNCH = 1-2-3-4-L-6-7-8-9-0:
                                \  
                                 9:  

If the string starts with a kick-punch combo, crouch at hit 4 and counter.  This 
is the best way to stop this string so you don't have to worry later.  However, 
if you block hit 4, you will eat a stun that will let him continue the string 
with a White Heron combo (1+4,2).  From there he can do the following at hit 8:

1) Thunder God Fist: Stand up if you think this coming.  However, he can follow 
up the Thunder God Fist with a mid/low kick.

2) Stun Punch: He starts the b,f+2 string.  Just block high.
          
                          L-6-L-8-U:         
                         /          
JIN PUNCH PUNCH = 1-2-3-4-5-6-L-L-9-0:
                                   \
                                    U:

If the 10-string starts with two punches, then it is also somewhat complicated.  
Here is what can happen next:

1) Punch Punch to Kick Kick: If hits 3 & 4 are kicks, then he is going for a 9-
string where hits 5 and 7 are low.  You have to hit him between hits 8 (mid) and 
9 since hit 9 is actually unblockable.

2) Punch Punch to Punch Punch: If hits 3 & 4 are punches, hit 7 will always be 
low.  Hit 8 can be high or low so block low to be safe.  Stand up for hit 9 
since that is always mid in this case.  Hit 10 can be an unblockable so if you 
see lightning, hit him before he hits you.  

DEVIL JIN = 1-2-3-4-5-6-7:

Just block high.  This is a true combo where only the 6th hit is mid.

For the record, this is the only section that is large and difficult.  The rest 
become much easier.  Jin just has too many hit strings. :)

==================
= Kazuya Mishima =
==================

Kazuya has 3 hit strings: 1 9-hit and 2 10-hit.  Here is the blocking chart:

                           U: 
                          /
KAZUYA = 1-2-3-4-5-6-L-L-9-0:
                      \
                       8-U:

Kazuya always starts with two punches.  However, what will happen next is based 
on hits 3 & 4:

1) Kicks: If hits 3 & 4 are kicks, then Kazuya is doing a 9-hit string.  Block 
low at hit 7 (always low), stand up for 8 (mid), and hit him out of hit 9 
(unblockable).  

2) Punches: If hits 3 & 4 are punches, then block low for hits 7 (always low) & 
8 (high or low but never mid) and stand up for 9.  If he starts to glow or spin 
around, hit him because he is doing an unblockable.

====================
= Heihachi Mishima =
====================

Even though Heihachi has 4 10-hit strings, 3 of them can be blocked exactly the 
same way.  Here is the blocking chart:

HEIHACHI = 1-2-3-4-5-6-L-8-9-0:
                \       /
                 L-L-6-7

Heihachi can start the string two ways:

1) Kick: If he starts the string with a side kick, hits 4 and 5 are low (Hell 
Sweeps).  You can low parry them.  The rest are high or mid.

2) Punch: If he starts with a punch, the 7th hit is low. Block low or parry.  

If you misblock the last low hit of either string, you eat the rest of it IIRC.

===============
= Angel/Devil =
===============

Angel/Devil only have one 10-hit string taken from Kazuya.  Here is the block 
chart:

ANGEL/DEVIL = 1-2-3-4-5-6-L-8-9-0

Hit 7 is always low.  Block low here or eat the rest of the string.

==============
= Jun Kazama =
==============

Jun has 3 hit strings - 1 4-hit and 2 10-hits.  Here is the block chart:

JUN = 1-2-3-4-5-L-7-L-9-0:
           \         \ /
            4:        L

Here is what can happen during the string:

1) Kick @ Hit 4: If hit 4 is a kick, the string will end there.

2) Punch @ Hit 4: If hit 4 is a punch, then be prepares to block low at hit 6.

Hit 6 is always low, but it can take one of two forms:

1) White Heron Kick: If hit 6 is the start of the White Heron combo, hit 8 is 
high (it can be high or low) and hit 9 is low.  Blocking hit 9 low allows hit 10 
to go over your head since it is high.

2) Punch: If hit 6 is a punch, then hit 8 will be low.  I believe hits 9 and 10 
are a Cartwheel Kick that can be reversed IIRC.

Remember Jun has many other strings series as well, which are not covered here.

===============
= Lee Chaolan =
===============

Lee has only one 10-hit string that is taken from Law:

LEE = 1-2-3-4-5-L-7-8-9-0:

As with Law, hit 6 is always low.

# CHAPTER III - MARTIAL ARTS WANNABES                                          #
################################################################################

These are characters who are imitations of famous martial artists past or 
present or who follow a popular, established martial art.

===============
= Forrest Law =
===============

Law's 10-strings are almost as complex as Jin's.  Unlike Jin, they can be 
defeated with a simple blocking scheme if you know the patterns.  Here is Law's 
simple blocking chart for all his strings:

LAW = 1-L-3-4-5-L-7-L-L-0:

Hit 2 can go high or low but not mid so block low to be safe.  Hit 3 is always 
mid so stand up quickly.  Hit 4 is high.  Hit 5 is always a high left kick so 
reverse it if you wish to or crouch and counter before Hit 6.  Hit 6 is always 
low and is good parry bait.  However, if you misblock it, you will usually eat 
the rest of the 10-string.  Hit 7 can be high or mid so stand up to be safe.  
Hit 8 and 9 can be high or low but not mid so block low to be safe.  Hit 10 is 
always mid so stand up.  You can also reverse hit 10 as it is always a flip 
kick/somersault.

==============
= Lei Wulong =
==============

Lei has 3 strings: 1 9-hit and 2 10-hit.  Here is the blocking chart:

            
                  L-L-9: 
                 / 
LEI = 1-2-L-4-5-6-7-8-L-0:
                     \ /           
                      9

It actually gets complicated if you forget to do one thing: block low on the 3rd 
hit.  If you block the 3rd hit, simply Hop Kick for a free juggle or WS+4 for 
free damage.  If you don't block it, he can juggle you with low backfists (very 
likely) or he will perform a backflip at hit 4 and continue the string (unlikely 
but possible).  Here is what can happen in the string from there:

1) Three Backflips: If Lei backflips, three times, he is going into his 9-hit 
string.  After the third flip, block low or parry hits 7 & 8 and stand up for 9.  

2) One Backflip: If he only backflips once, you won't have a problem until hit 
9, which can be mid or low.  However, since hit 7 is a break point and a high 
kick, you have a window where you can crouch and quickly counter (hit 8 is mid) 
or reverse the kick.  Since the other two strings are the same until hit 9, you 
best stop Lei before that time.  If you block hit 9, you can reverse hit 10 as 
it is always a high kick.

Do yourself a favor: Block low at hit 3 and counter to stop the string. :) 

============================
= Eddy Gordo/Tiger Jackson =
============================

Eddy only has 1 true hit string.  However, he can link to his Leg Whip strings 
halfway through the string for many more possibilities.  Here is his blocking 
chart:

EDDY/TIGER = 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0-1:
                      \
                       L

If the 6th hit is low, he goes into the Leg Whip strings (which will not be 
discussed here).  Block high otherwise.  It may be better to stand and block 
since Eddy's 11-hit has no break points after the 4th hit or later IIRC.

============
= Hwoarang =
============

Hwoarang has 2 10-hit strings.  Here is his blocking chart:

HWAORANG - 1-2-3-L-5-6-L-8-9-0:

For Hwoarang, hits 4 & 7 are always low.  Hits 7 & 8 are the Firecracker combo 
(d+4,4) so block low and counter/punish. 

================
= Baek Doo San =
================

Beak also has 2 10-hit strings.  Here is his blocking chart:

BAEK = 1-2-L-4-5-6-7-8-L-0:
            \
             L-5-6-7-L-9-U:

If hit 3 is low (it can be high or low), hit 4 is mid and hit 9 will be low.  If 
hit 4 is low (it can be low or mid), hit 5 is mid, hit 8 will be low, and hit 10 
will be an unblockable that can be reversed IIRC, avoided, or countered.

================
= Paul Phoenix =
================

Here is how you can best defend against Paul's 10-strings:
         
               5:
              /  
PAUL = 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-L-9-0:
              \         /
               L-6-7-8-L

If he goes into his 5 hit, it ends in a deathfist so block high if you're 
not sure what string he is doing.  It's not worth losing a ton of damage because 
you crouched at hit 5.  He can also do a 10-hit string where the 5th hit is low.  
If Paul goes into his 10-hit strings, remember this: If the 5th hit is low, the 
9th hit is also low.  Otherwise, the 8th hit will be low.  That's all you ever 
need to know.  

==============
= Bryan Fury =
==============

Bryan Fury has 3 hit strings: 2 8-hit and 1 10-hit.  Here is the blocking chart:

BRYAN = 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0:
                     \
                      8:

Bryan's block chart is quite simple because there are no low hits in any of his 
hit strings.  Also, hits 5 & 6 are always high - you know the routine. :)

===============
= Ling Xiaoyu =
===============

Ling has 2 10-hit strings.  Here is the blocking chart:

LING = 1-2-3-L-L-6-L-L-9-0:
            \   /    
             4-5

Ling can go low or mid at hits 4 and 5.  After that, hits 7 & 8 are always low.

===============
= Bruce Irvin =
===============

Bruce Irvin has no 10-hit strings.  He has tons of other canned strings. :)

===============
= Julia Chang =
===============

Julia has 3 10-hit strings.  Here is the blocking chart: 

JULIA = 1-2-3-4-L-6-7-L-9-U:
                     \   
                      8-L-0:

Remember that the 5th hit is always low - low parry it if you can.  Stand up 
again for hits 6 and 7 since they are either mid or high.  It get somewhat 
complicated after that though.  Hit 8 can be high, mid, or low, but hit 9 is a
break point.  Even if you misblock hit 8, you will be OK as long as you block 
hit 9.  It comes down to this for the last three hits: 

1) Hit 8 Is Low: if Hit 8 is low, block high for hit 9.  If hit 9 is blocked, 
hit 10 won't come out since it's a Sky Upper (listed as an unblockable).

2) Hit 8 Is Not Low: If hit 8 isn't low, hit 9 will be low and hit 10 will be 
mid (a Flash Upper).  That wasn't too confusing, was it? ;)

At hit 8, you basically switch blocking from low to high or vice versa.

==================
= Michelle Chang =
==================

Michelle has the same 10-hit strings as Julia:

MICHELLE = 1-2-3-4-L-6-7-L-9-U:
                        \   
                         8-L-0:

Remember that the 5th hit is always low - low parry it if you can.  Stand up 
again for hits 6 and 7 since they are either mid or high.  It get somewhat 
complicated after that though.  Hit 8 can be high, mid, or low, but hit 9 is 
break point.  Even if you misblock hit 8, you will be OK as long as you block 
hit 9.  It comes down to this for the last three hits: 

1) Hit 8 Is Low: if Hit 8 is low, block high for hit 9.  If hit 9 is blocked, 
hit 10 won't come out since it's a Sky Upper (listed as an unblockable).

2) Hit 8 Is Not Low: If hit 8 isn't low, hit 9 will be low and hit 10 will be 
mid (a Flash Upper).  That wasn't too confusing, was it? ;)

At hit 8, you basically switch blocking from low to high or vice versa.

= Wang Jinrei =
===============

Wang only has one ten hit string.  It is actually from Julia and Michelle Chang:

WANG = 1-2-3-4-L-6-7-8-L-0:

Hits 5 and 9 are low - simple. :)

= Nina Williams =
=================

Nina has three 10-hit strings.  Even though they can get really hectic, it is 
simple to block them if you know the trick:

NINA = 1-2-3-4-5-L-L-8-L-0:

Hit 1 can be mid or high.  The second through fifth hits are always high so you 
can crouch and D+1 before hit 6.  Hit 5 is always a high kick so reverse it if 
you're feeling risky and frisky.  The 6th hit is always low for all strings.  
Hits 7 and 9 can be high or low but never mid, so if you're not sure what string 
she is doing, then block low at those points to be safe.  Stand up for hit 8 
with Nina since it can be only mid or high.  Hit 10 is always a kick so if you 
block/avoid hit 9, feel free to reverse the kick.  

=================
= Anna Williams =
=================

Anna only has one hit string so the blocking chart is simple:

ANNA = 1-2-3-4-5-L-7-8-9-0

Hit 1 can be mid or high.  All the hits afterward are high except for Hit 6 
(low).  Ironically, you can use Nina's blocking chart as well for Anna since 
Anna's only string is also used by Nina.

============
= Gun Jack =
============

Gun Jack has 4 10-hit strings:

GUN JACK = 1-L-L-4-5-6-7-8-9-0:
            \       /     \ /
             2-L-L-L       L

There are two ways he can start the string:

1) Jump Punch: If he jumps for Hit 1, then hits 3-5 will be low Cossack Kicks.

2) Low Right Punch (d+2): From here, he will go into a low Shark Attack for hits 
2 & 3 and uppercut for 4 and 5.

At hit 6-8, block high for the Wild Swing mid triple.  He can then go low or 
mid.  If you see Gun Jack duck down, block low.  Stand for hit 10.   

==========
= Jack-2 =
==========

Jack-2 has the same strings as Gun Jack:

JACK-2 = 1-L-L-4-5-6-7-8-9-0:
          \       /     \ /
           2-L-L-L       L

There are two ways he can start the string:

1) Jump Punch: If he jumps for Hit 5, then hits 3-5 will be low Cossack Kicks.

2) Low Right Punch (d+2): From here, he will go into a Shark Attack for hits 2 & 
3 and uppercut for 4 and 5.

At hit 6-8, block high for the Wild Swing mid triple.  He can then go low or 
mid.  If you see Jack-2 duck down, block low.  Stand for hit 10.   

==================
= Prototype Jack =
==================

P. Jack only has one string, borrowed from Gun Jack and Jack-2:

PROTOTYPE JACK = 1-L-L-4-5-6-7-8-9-0

Block low at hits 2 & 3.

==========
= Ganryu =
==========

Ganryu does not have any 10-hit strings.

==============
= Kuma/Panda =
==============

Kuma doesn't have any 10-hit strings either.

# CHAPTER VII - THE KINGS OF GIANT SWING                                       #
################################################################################

========
= King =
========

King has 5 10-hit strings, but he can turn them into 9-hit strings by starting 
with a right punch (F+2).  In any case, the F+2 right punch is always considered 
hit 2 in this analysis even if King started the string with it.

Here is his blocking chart:

         2
          \ 
KING = 1-2-3-4-5-L-L-L-9-0:
                \   /
                 6-L-L-L-T:

Everything up to hit 5 is mid or high.  However, hit 6 can be mid or low 
depending on what hit 5 is:

1) Hit 5 Punch: If hit 5 is a punch (df+2 elbow), hits 6 and 7 are low.

2) Hit 5 Kick: If hit 5 is a kick (WS+3), hit 6 is a mid jump kick (uf+3).  Both 
kicks are easily reversible.  Hit 7 is always a low Stagger Kick.

Even though hit 8 is always low, hit 9 can be low or mid depending on hit 8:

1) Hit 8 Stagger Kick: If hit 8 is a Stagger Kick, stand up and block high for 
hit 9 and hit 10.

2) Hit 8 Foot Sweep: If hit 8 is a foot sweep (d+3), then hit 9 is low.  Block 
low at all costs as hit 10 is a throw (escaped by 1+2).  If hit 9 is blocked, 
hit 10 will not come out.

It is important that you block the first low Stagger Kick in either combo.  If 
you misblock, you are stunned for a long time, giving King a huge advantage.

==============
= Armor King =
==============

Armor King only has one 10-hit string, which is taken from King:

               2
                \
ARMOR KING = 1-2-3-4-5-L-L-L-9-0:

Block low at hits 6, 7, and 8.  Like King, he can start his string with an F+2.
Like King, I believe that hit 6 causes a long stun if misblocked.

==============
= Alex/Roger =
==============

Alex/Roger does not have any 10-hit strings.

# CHAPTER VIII - THE MITSUS                                                    #
################################################################################

==============
= Yoshimitsu =
==============

Yoshimitsu has 7 hit strings total - 2 5-hit, 2 8-hit, and 3 10-hit.  Several of 
them end in unblockables so it is imperative that you stop the string before he 
gets to that point.  Here is the block chart for Yoshimitsu 10-strings:

                       6-7-8-U-U:
                      / 
YOSHIMITSU = 1-2-3-4-5-L-7-U-U-U:
                    \     \
                     U:    8:

Yoshimitsu can start his two ways:

1) Punch Upper Upper: If Yoshi starts with a Punch and two Uppercuts, you can 
reverse the 4th hit, a high right kick.  You can also crouch under and counter.  
Hit 6 in this case can be low or mid so it is best to stop Yoshi before then.

2) Two Kicks: If Yoshi starts with 2 kicks, you can reverse the second one or 
crouch under and counter.  In this scenario, you need to stop him before hit 5 
because he has 5 hit strings that end with unblockables.  If he doesn't do a 5-
hit with the unblockable, then you can reverse hit 5 (a right kick) or low parry 
hit 6 (a low kick).  If you do neither, you may end up eating unblockables.  

In either case, if Hit 5 is a kick, hit 6 will be low.  Be careful in both 
cases.  If you don't stop Yoshi by hit 7, you may be eating unblockables if he 
does a full 10 hit.  If he ends up doing an 8-hit, consider yourself lucky. :) 

=============
= Kunimitsu =
=============

Kunimitsu only has one 10-hit string taken from Yoshimitsu:

KUNIMITSU = 1-2-3-4-5-L-7-8-9-U

Hit 10 is unblockable.  Hit 6 is low.  Hits 4 & 5 are high kicks so reverse or 
counter.  You can stop the unblockable if you're quick.

Ogre has no 10-hit strings.  He already borrows enough moves from other people.

=============

True Ogre has no 10-hit strings either.  He also borrows a lot of moves from 
other people and can breathe fire to boot.  Why would he need them?

################################################################################

Mokujin/Tetsujin is a copycat character.  It will take on the moves and 
mannerisms of any character except Ogre, True Ogre, and Angel/Devil.  However, 
it is important to be able to quickly figure out who Mokujin/Tetsujin is 
mimicking.  The easiest one to tell is Eddy by his obvious stance.  However, 
others are harder unless they throw moves at you.

I hope this has helped clear up how to block 10-hit strings.  I didn't want to 
get too much into parrying and reversals.  Once you can block the 10-strings, 
then consider how to parry, reverse, and counter.  I would appreciate any tips 
on the FAQ itself.  Email me at the address below any comments, questions, 
critiques, or flames.  Thank you for taking your time to read this.
