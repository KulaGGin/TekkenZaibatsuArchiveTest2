1) LEGAL MATTERS
================

TTT is registered and copyright Namco. All char's etc
are also copyright Namco. This faq is to show how to
use and when to do moves of Roger from the hit TTT
and is not to be changed or altered without my consent
and permission. This means, in simple terms for you
dumasses out there who are going to go around it anyway.
That if I find you ripping my faq, I will be ripping you
apart. This faq is PROTECTED. So there.

Now ON WITH THE FAQ

==============================================================================
2) SOMETHING TO REMEMBER
==========================

Its been 3 years now, I have played roger for a long time. I intend to
rebuild this faq from the experience I have gained over this time. Amongst
other things, I want to make this the last and complete version. Rewrite
quite a bit of it. And modify it. The spell-check took forever and a day,
oh the horror. I can't believe I didn't have access to a spell check all
those years ago.

29\04\2003  -   This is it, after all the years of experience the faq
Ver. 5.0        is going to be almost completely modified. Should be
                and interesting few weeks of work. I intend to pour all
                my knowledge into this version of the faq, and hope that
                it will be complete. The overhaul will remove a lot of
                the humour that made it an "enjoyable" read and add a lot
                of fact and strategies that will make it a much more
                technical and useful read. But the level of play has
                become a lot higher since I wrote this faq, and even
                scrubs can wavedash these days. So sit back and I will
                list the changes below as they are done.

                - Spell Check
                - General Focus Of Faq Rewritten
                - All move write-ups redone
                - Vs. Char's section adjusted
                - Plans for another update added.

19\09\2000  -   Well first overhaul, not much changed actually,
Ver. 2.0        more of a focus on some tactics, like wave dashing
                with roger (yes this can be done) and crouch cancelling
                etc.. There are some really good new features, I have
                added a bigger custom string section, as it has been
                asked for so many times, I thought I would add it.
                Oh, and now I think of it, killed the Ideal Tag Partner
                section, have decided that that is personal opinion, its
                up to you who you team 'em up with, I am here to show you
                how to use roger. =) And added the styles of play section
                to add to some fun. And also added some VS players char
                strats.. These are still open for anyone that still
                has any, I am happy to hear it. Ya all know my email.

19\11\2000  -   Damn this is an overhaul.. God thank you abrar for showing
                me all the mistakes that actually were in the faq.. bah..
                and a serious apology for Euro Tekken, they have been a
                great help and a great board.. helping with many things and
                I left them out of the credits on the last update, so here I
                am doing the formal apology..

                Euro Tekken, my greatest apologies upon the mistake of
                leaving you and your great board off my faq.. So my dearest
                apologies and may you have a long and prosperous tekken
                journey.

                Anyway, now that that's done with.. On with the huge move
                update, redoing a lot of the ratings and stuff.

13\4\2001   -   Just left me wondering if I actually did release the last
                update of this faq at all, I don't think I did, but I figure
                with the update of my Bruce Faq I should fix some spelling
                and what not, and add the f,f,n+2 into Tomb Stone.

==============================================================================
3) INTRODUCTION
===============

Roger or by all the same rights, Alex, are two technical characters that
have no real power of there own to become abusive and over used. This faq
won't make you an expert in one day. But then again there isn't a faq in
existence that will do that. This faq will give you the guidelines that
are necessary to win with Roger \ Alex in a standard tournament environment.
It is up to you to take it to the next level with practice and skill.

Becoming a master Roger \ Alex is very fulfilling, and wiping the smiles of
the sceptical faces of the crowd is just all the better.

==============================================================================
7) IN-DEPTH MOVE ANALYSIS
=========================

The rating system has been removed for reasons of different moves are used
at different times. The use of a move depends on the situation and the
follow ups available. I will mention any abbusable moves in the listing if
you can abuse them.

==============================================================================
KANGA-THROWS
==============
Throw name             Command     Throw-Type      Damage
Escape/Note
----------            ---------    ------------    --------

ANIMAL STONEHEAD       1+3              front           30             1
Grabs opponents' head and headbutts them viciously...

Common throw, there are better ones than this, but for
reasons of completeness I will add it here.

Good followups, standard throw. Use whenever you need a
quick and effective move to break opponents guard.

==============================================================================
JUMPING POWERBOMB         2+4           front           30              2
Grabs opponent and plants a powerbomb with pretty blue stuff
all over the place...

This throw looks cool. Learn to pull off the command throws faster
and substitute them for this. Otherwise use this in the mixup. Its
a good guard breaker.

==============================================================================
DDT                     d/b,D/B+1+2     front           45              1+2
Roger\Alex grabs opponents' head, before falling to the ground
and making them eat dirt...

This move can't be done WC.

The double button escape makes it good to pull out
when ever you feel the need. Don't get too predictable
with it. Don't give them a chance to catch on.

Mix it up with the normal and other throws.
It's D/B motion is a handy buffer from backdash or any
other useful b or d/b move. You can initiate this by doing
the d/b to get the backdash instead, and if they attack simply
press two punches to catch and throw.

==============================================================================
GIANT SWING             f,b,HCF+1       front           70              1
Takes opponent by the legs and turns around a few times before
releasing, throwing them a huge distance...

This move, again, is one of his best. It is good for stopping
momentum. If they quick recover, it does half damage, and leaves a
distance between you and your opponent, and you with the
initiative. The reach of this move is VERY good, so if
your opponent thinks he's out of throwing distance, use it.

For those more advanced users, you will all know that Rogers
crouch cancel and crouch dash are very fast, if you want to
crouch cancel into a Giant Swing the command is something like

f,n,d,d/f~f,b,hcf+1

==============================================================================
ANIMAL DRIVER           QCF+1           front           25          1, (3+4)
Grabs opponent by the arms, turns them upside down, and dumps
them head first onto the ground...

Not worth mention. Move on.

==============================================================================
TOMBSTONE PILEDRIVER    d/b,F+1+2       front           58              2
Roger\Alex turns opponent upside down and drops to his knees,
planting opponents head into the ground...

Learn this motion FAST and FLUENT. Big damage, no recovery,
front throw, looks cool. It gives you initiative, and leaves your
opponent really close.

Follow up with a SS+4 if they like to quick recover with a rising
kick, and you will plant them to the ground again.
If they just lie there, a simple sweep or d/f+1+2 headbutt will do a
fine job of hitting them for some good damage. The headbutt leaves
your opponent a little further away.

==============================================================================
ANIMAL FACE CRUSHER     1+3_2+4         left            40              1
Roger/Alex grab the opponent in a headlock, run along
and drop to the ground planting their face into the
ground.

When you have to do a side throw, do it. Not much to
say really. Go for it.

==============================================================================
ANIMAL ROLLING ARM LOCK	1+3_2+4		right		40		2
Roger/Alex take the opponents arm, jump up, swing around
their head, and ends up with an arm drag, kinda like the
tag throw 2+5 with a cool twirly bit.

==============================================================================
REVERSE THROW          1+3_2+4          bt              var            var
Varies. Roger/Alex turn around real fast and throw.

Stock Standard. Next.

==============================================================================
REVERSE NECK THROW      1+3_2+4       back        50       Inescapable
Slides in behind the opponent and grabs they're head, then hip
tosses them onto their stomach.

It's a Back Throw.

**** 10/10 When you're behind, do the damage.

==============================================================================
KANGA-MOVES
=============
Move name                Command             Level           Damage
--------------           ------------        ------          ---------
ONE TWO UPPER            1,2,1               h,h,m           6,10,10
Roger/Alex does a right punch, then a left, then an uppercut.

A good string that can't easily be interrupted. It does good
damage and ends with a mid attack, making it a general safe
string to use when you are not quite sure what to do next.

The move itself you will use often enough as it has a lot of
forward drive. Moving Roger into the opponent to get closer
to initiate your poke string game. But then again it is also
a good move to push your opponent back if you are finding
yourself in a lot of trouble.

As with all linear strings, try not to do this at a distance.
As it is easily SS for big damage on Rogers side.

==============================================================================
CROUCHING UPPER         D,D/F+2           m           20
Roger\Alex simply does a smallish uppercut.

This is a given move, its not used often, and its range isn't
exactly desirable. Use it often enough at a good distance as
an interrupt or to intercept a whiffed move, but do not abuse
it by any means unless you are looking to loose the match.

As with a lot of Roger stuff you don't want to whiff much,
the problem with whiffing is that the EWGF or the DEWGF are
always at hand to lift you off the ground. And combine that
with low stamina and you have suffering.

Use this against a whiffed EWGF if you don't have time to do
the SS+4 or something of the sort.

==============================================================================
ELBOW STING                     d/f+1         m             ?
Roger/Alex does a rather hard and good distanced elbow downwards
on top of the opponent...

This move is fast, even thou its an elbow, it can be reversed.
It has a slight guard stun, good recovery, and knocks opponents FD/FA
so it gives good initiative, and follow ups on a counter.

Its speed adds to its usefulness in custom strings, and does great
damage. I still do not know the damage for it, anyone know email
me. Great priority, but don't try and beat out moves you don't have
to, like the WGF and TGF. And by "Priority" I mean awesome interrupt.

==============================================================================
ANIMAL GIGATON PUNCH         f,f,N+1       m            23
Roger\Alex leans back (ducking) and then drives a hard punch
into the opponents ribs...

This is a really nasty moves in the hands of a skilled player.
It takes effort and time to learn which moves it is good against
and which not. It is also good for wakeup and will hit grounded
opponents like Kumas and Jacks. It ducks high attacks and has
no real noticeable start up frames whatsoever, it only looks that way.
Its not like Pauls deathfist. This move has just enough start time
for any annoying poker to have finished a whiffed poke, to eat this.
What I mean, is when you see a poke, and it whiffs, do this. When
your opponent brings his arm back, this should go in and hit him.
Its not quite an ANTI POKE device, but it serves useful. Also,
when you want to punish an opponent, or an opponent tags, this
move is the way to gain initiative. Its ducking ability is enough
to annoy jacks who enjoy the f+1+2.

Its safe on block and has the best range out of a good portion of
Rogers moves. Its not completely abusable but it defiantly has its
uses that is for certain.


If the move hits, and is NOT kickup recovered,
(When the opponent flips up onto there feet by holding F)
Then the u/f+2+4 elbow drop is guaranteed for some big
extra damage, as that is the ONLY escape from it.

==============================================================================
ANIMAL GODFIST              f,N,d,f+1        m              50
Roger\Alex crouch dashes and then lets off with a rather
large and nasty uppercut....

This is the move most people DREAD. Roger/Alex are small
characters in there own right. It one of his strong points,
and should be used as one.

The AGF hits mid. And crouches beneath a good amount of moves.
Training the opponent to block low is really easy with Roger,
most people fear the ss+4 more than the AGF simply because it
is abused more than the AGF. Training the opponent simply
requires you to use the SS+4 to its fullest advantage, and then
SS to an AGF. The opponent will most likely duck on reaction.

This move is the move you want to use against taggers, as it
does huge damage on counter hit, crouches very low to avoid
a good amount of attacks. It is the juggle ender of choice for
almost all his juggles, and defiantly his staples.

It comes out quick and does extreme damage in netsu, this is a
great move to come out of a tag with, as in tag Roger in and as
he comes in cancel the run and AGF. You can avoid even EWGF with
this if you time it correctly.

Its downfall is that if it is blocked, your opponent can do a
simple 1 to *float* you for a quick damage juggle.

==============================================================================
ANIMAL SMASH (a)             f,N,d,d/f+1+2           m             22
Roger\Alex crouch dashes, before charging slightly, then doing
a vicious headbutt...

Bad move. Next.

==============================================================================
ANIMAL SMASH (b)           FC+1+2            m              22
Roger\Alex charges slightly, doing a vicious headbutt...

This is a great move, and highly under used. It hits mid for
decent damage, knocks the opponent backwards on a block with
semi decent stun. I don't know of any retaliations if this is
blocked that are guaranteed. But this is yet to be completely
tested. It has OK tracking, so on a SS opponent wait till the
SS is almost over before hitting them with this.

It hits MID but Roger goes very low to do so. It is an excellent
move for breaking out of those high strings, from Bob and Jin and
the like. And goes under a good amount of mid moves too.

Trick is not to whiff it completely, cause that leaves Roger open
for long enough to put you at a great disadvantage. Its not
completely abusable, but I use this a lot to great effect.

==============================================================================
Tail Tripper                    d/b+3               l             17
Roger\Alex turns around, using his tail to trip the opponent up..

Its a really close move with low damage and its very hard to hit.
Use it if you want to stop momentum but he does have better options.
I use it as a taunt.

==============================================================================
Konvict Kick                    f,f+4               m             26
Roger\Alex lunches forward with a huge kick..

This is a "by choice" move. It is safe on block depending on
were you are, and it hits mid. Its medium speed. But its not
something people generally block on reaction. Which means it
is really useful to throw out once in a while. Its safer than
the AGF and I don't by any means say abuse the move. I do say
use it when you need a good mid hitting stationary move. Were
you won't move any great distance.

==============================================================================
LOW JAB ~ UPPERCUT              d+1, n+2          sm,m           5,15
Roger\Alex do a simple jab before hitting with a nice uppercut...

This is your poke of choice. When your in close to the opponent,
do this. A lot. It goes sm, m which means your opponent will be
forced out of his ducking position, weather it is to block or
if he is hit by the mid hit of the move. This means Roger has
initiative in both ways as he has forced the WS move out of
the opponent and now they are were he needs them. Up close,
personal and standing ready for the next poking assault.

A lot of his game revolves around getting in close and using
this not only for damage, but as escape. This move can interrupt
a lot of things, including EWGF if timed right. But I wouldn't
rely on it solely for that purpose. Use it, then backdash to get
out of the opponent if you find yourself in trouble.

==============================================================================
WIND MILL PUNCH                 f,N+1            h                30
Roger\Alex "rolls" one hand over another before leaning forward,
and hitting the opponent with his fist.

Used sparingly even the best players will fall for this sooner
or later. Its timing is a little slow, so you most likely want
to go into a few setups to get this happening. Things like
abusing the d/f+1 and the d+1,n+2 to push the opponent into
a general standing position are good ways to setup the f,n+1.

Abusing this move isn't an option. But when it hits you can
land a CLEAN AGF on the blocking opponent, for some great damage.
Also any throw is guaranteed. As well as the Hopkick and I *believe*
the Frankensteiner.

==============================================================================
ANIMAL RUSH TO WINDMILL PUNCH   f,f,1,2,1,2,1    h,h,h,h,m    10,15,10,15,20
Roger\Alex rushes forward with a series of jabs, before doing
a "Wind Up" and nice hard punch to the mid...

On counterhit this is a great move. The f,f,1,2,1,2 is
what you want to hit on counter, leaving out the last
windmill punch. This gives you a free AGF instead of
the windmill.

I tend to use the whole thing, if the opponent blocks.
You should really cut the string off before the last 1
but I tend to like the mid hit and the stun of the last
punch regardless in general. Its not a hugely abusable
move but the first 1,2 is a great poke to use, and the
string can be cut off any time. So you can use the 1,2
as a CH bait.

==============================================================================
HEAD 1ST LUNGE       f,f+1+2       h(close),l(far)         15
Roger\Alex dives headfirst into the opponent and ends up rolling
onto his feet.

This is a hard move to use, though it has great guard stun,
it really depends on the situation. The damage isn't really
worth the effort, and on the rarity that I use this for the
stun I tend to mix it up between Tombstone, DDT and AGF.

This is more of a high risk setup than anything else, and
I wouldn't advise using the move. At least not often. It does
however it grounded, and can be used as distanced OKI.

==============================================================================
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT      u/f+1+2_F+1+2_f+1+2          m            35
Jumps into the air and lands, hands together, on the
opponents' head.

Its damage is somewhat more of a power move for roger. There is
no real retaliation vs this attack, if you get caught in mid air
thou, be ready for a small juggle. Else, if you are against an
Eddy or Ling, use this when they do handstand or phoenix positions,
were they can not block, and this move will evade most of there
attacks. The other option for this move, is stopping tech rollers
while they are rolling. Again, like the SS+4 you can do it over
and over. It also kills quick recovers, and should be used on a
ground opponent at least once a match. Its most likely going to hit
any moving character, and if the opponent is smart, then he will lie
there and take the Ali Kicks that should follow soon after. This
is not an OKIZEME tactic, as it will not hit grounded opponents,
but it sure as hell comes close.

This hits large characters on the ground.

==============================================================================
ANIMAL HEADBUTT         d/f+1+2         m          20
Roger/Alex does a downward headbutt with the side of their head...

This move is really rather short when it comes to hitting
standing opponents. But to hit a ground opponent this can
be your best friend. On a standing opponent, it will leave them
with a good guard stun. No follow ups. It knocks crouching
opponents to the floor.

Good for Oki or as free damage after a few of the throws. Is used
in one of his main SS+4 juggles but other than that it is a good
close range fast, mid hitting move that leaves opponent with recovery
and recovers fast enough for you to be safe from retaliation. Its
not a use and abuse move, but it does the trick in most cases.

==============================================================================
JAB ~ UPPERCUT          2,1             h,m         12,12
Roger\Alex simply does a jab, then an uppercut...

On generalisation, I use the d+1, N+2 a lot more than this,
because the 2 is a lot slower than the d+1.

This combo leaves a good stun when it hits, it comes out
slow, not interruptible. King can put a giant swing almost
guaranteed after this, as can Roger.

==============================================================================
ANIMAL GUT PUNCH        d/f+2          m               ?
Roger\Alex puts his elbow hard into the opponents' ribs...

This is a great, quick, fast recovery fast hitting mid move
that does a small amount of damage. And has short range. It
is a use and abuse move, when ever you are close to the opponent
or in range for a fast and abusive poke use this. Or the d+1,n+2.

I think this is one of his more safer options actually.

==============================================================================
JUMPING KNEE DROP          u/f+3+4           m                  40
Roger/Alex Jumps up and lands on opponent with both knees...

Only ever used on RARE setups. And occasional Oki. Next.

==============================================================================
Elbow Drop              U/F+2+4                 m              35
Roger/Alex jumps into the air, and does a BIG elbow drop...

Rare Oki setups, and distance PLD Lei's that enjoy staying on
the ground. Can be used on Ling or Eddy too. Not advised.

Also don't forget it is the guaranteed followup to the
f,f,n+1 if the opponent doesn't kick up. The knee drop is not.


==============================================================================
EXPLODER            3+4          m                25
Roger\Alex waits a while, before leaping into the air for
a double leg dropkick...

This leaves OK guard stun. Bad start up times. Next.

==============================================================================
RUNNING DROPKICK          f,f+3+4             m                  25
Roger\Alex leaps into the air for a double leg drop kick...(no lag)

Much faster than its brotherly counterpart. Its damage is
understandable and its speed is good too. The main use of
this move however IS its range. Taggers, long range blond
bombers, who ever likes to stand out of range and do big
moves. Its also good for people who are running in towards
you. The main thing about this move, is the guard stun it
leaves behind. You should not be oki'd if you use this properly.
And I think it is one of the most underused moves in the game.

==============================================================================
SATELLITE DROPKICK            (RN)f,f,f+3+4         m              40
Roger\Alex runs along, before leading into the air and doing a
SPINNING dropkick...Very cool looking.

Its better than the dropkick counterpart, damage and style
wise, but its also harder to pull off. If you need the
dropkick, try for this. You will only get the drop kick
if you miss..  Otherwise it has the same tendances as the
last two dropkicks, except for a noticeably larger guard stun.

This is my move of choice.

==============================================================================
STOMACH SMASH          f,f,N+2         l               6
Roger/Alex crouches forward and smashes the opponent in the stomach...

On a counter, this causes double over stun. Useful to the point of
if your quick, you can catch the double overed opponent, or
if they tag of the stun, you can catch the tagging opponent
off guard. This is also fast, good range, and good recovery
time. And can be mixed up with the K's Flicker. The main use
of this move, is to do a long range counter. It wont juggle
like K's Flicker, but it hits low, which is why it surprises
so many people. It is one of the few high moves that hits low.
The damage is nothing, you get more out of a poke, but used in
custom strings, this is one of the best moves you can come out
with. To start a match, this can also be a good idea. It leaves
a good stun, and chances are, you and your opponent both went for
a move. So the chances of a Counter are rather high. Use this also
on fallen players as OKIZEME.

Don't overuse the move, unless you are training an opponent to block
low. If so, then use this in conjunction with the SS+4 and the d/b+3.

The AGF is the easiest follow up on ch. As well as any standard throw.
Giantswing, Piledrive, Stonehead. Etc.

==============================================================================
FRANKENSTEINER       d/f+3+4           ?                 15
Roger\Alex flips over head first. On a good connect he catches
opponents head with legs and flips back over planting opponents
head into ground...

This has a long range and is not blockable. Use this in those
awkward situations when you don't know what to do next, and both
you and your opponent are standing waiting for each other to move.

Sometimes you will get jabbed out of this, most of the time you
will land it. The frames on this ( I am told ) are in the 20's
but I just somehow find that hard to believe. I think perhaps the
frames for the ENTIRE animation may be that high.

Its a great move to use in the middle of a poke string, and it is
defiantly worth going for if you need a safe tag. It can tag to
things like Bob's Unblockable.

==============================================================================
Animal Sweep            SS+4                    l              17
Roger\Alex sidesteps into a large sweep, and stays very close to
the ground.

It will duck all high hitting, and even mid hitting move.
Don't whiff it, cause if it is blocked, it will leave you in a
sweep stun position. For this reason it should be mixed up with
the Hop Kick u/f+4. This is one of my most used moves.
It can be the best move if you use it carefully.

Don't get predictable, use it ONLY when you SS a move and see an
opening, I cant stress this enough, it is best used as a COUNTER
attack, something like a free reversal. You should never attack
with this move. It has frames enough for a good opponent
to see coming. If you SS or anticipate a move then you will get
a lot further with this move than any other.

==============================================================================
8) COMBOS AND JUGGLES
==========================

Unfortunately, Roger/Alex really lack in this department, its kind
a shame really, that's all they need to be REALLY mean..

Sweep: SS+4, U+3+4

d+1, WC 1+2                       <-- Thanks Synner. (Yup. LoL.)
d/f+1+2, f+1+2                    <-- Big Chars and Taggers only.
d+1, WC, F+2
d+1, d+3+4
d/f+3+4                           <-- Not a true juggle.
d/b+3, d/f+1+2
d+1, CC, 1, f,n,d,d/f+1
d+1, CC, 1, f,f+4

Small Juggle: u/f+4, WS+2 etc

u/f+4, d+1, WC+1+2
2, 4, d+3+4
1, 1, f,n,d,d/f+1 (My staple juggle)
4, f,f+4
d+1, N+2, d+3+4
d/f+1+2, d+3+4
f,f+1,2,1,2 ,f,n,d,d/f+1  (Big characters only)

Those are the main ones I can think of..

High Launchers: Devil SS+2, P. Jack SS+1 etc

f,n,d,d/f+1, d+3+4
f,N+1, 1, f,n,d,d/f+1
f,f,N+1
u/f+4, 1, f,n,d,d/f+1

==============================================================================
9) Okizeme and Ground Games
===========================

This is grounding your opponent, and hitting them or keeping
them on the ground for extra damage. To do this here are a list
of moves in no particular order.

Ground Hitting:

d/f+1+2
d+3+4, (4), (4)
d/f+3+4
U_U/F+3+4
U_U/F+2+4
d/b+3
SS+4
U+3+4
d+3_d+4

Tech Rolling\Quick Recovering:

All of the Above
F+1+2
FC+1+2
f,f+4

When doing okizeme, do whatever move you feel necessary to
keep your opponent grounded. Some characters, like NINA, can
do huge amounts of damage on a grounded opponent before they
can get up. However, Rogers strong point is poking. So Okizime
is not the easiest thing to do. Here is a simple rundown.

If an opponent techrolls:
At a distance, it is a good idea to do the f+1+2, because of its
jumping ability, it will move a large distance forward, and hit
the roller. Otherwise, a shorter distance, the f,f+4 jail kick
will help, because of its slightly longer than normal mid hitting
range. If the opponent is close, and you are in a ducking position,
The FC+1+2 is the best option, as it will leave the opponent a nice
distance of the U_U/F+3+4 knee drop, or the running ali kicks.

A grounded opponent:
The main Okizeme tactic here is the SS+4 that will leave the opponent
flat on the ground in front of you, after a rising attack. Otherwise,
if the opponent is distanced, the knee drop is a much better idea.
It does 40 damage, which is more than most moves do to knock the
opponent down. Otherwise, a quick ali kick will get you into a safe
distance from your opponent, while doing a small amount of damage.

==============================================================================
10)Styles of Play
=================

- Crouch Dashing

This should be the biggest part of your Roger game, it will utilise
every opportunity for a fast and deadly attack, you must learn the
f,n,d,d/f motion fluently. Thou Roger does not have as many attacks
as the mishimas from the CD, this means you have to learn the cancel
and utilise more of his standard moves, which in my opinion can be
absolutely devastating. This talent is used for getting close very
fast, and range for Roger is a big issue. Being small he can get
under a lot of moves, and using this before or even after a sidestep
can give you the advantage you need for some big damage.

- Wave Dashing

Or, seeing that its not QUITE a wave dash, I shall call it an ANIMAL
DASH. Now this looks somewhat different from the wave dash, but has
the same priorities. It goes under High attacks, closes large distances
at a small time, and can chain into ANY move what so ever. Including
things like the Giant Swing.

The motion is done like so..

f,n,d,d/f,f,f,n,d,d/f and so on.

You get the idea.

- Animal Dash Crouch Cancelling

This is somewhat an abbreviation of the ANIMAL DASH (god I love saying
that.. ) The reason I put it AFTER the ANIMAL DASH is because
if you can ANIMAL DASH then you can CROUCH CANCEL. The motion is simple
as you are doing it already. You have to break into the chain, and
pull of a move. Like so.

f,n,d,d/f,f,f,N+1

This is a Crouch Cancel into a f,f,n+1.

Many things can be crouch cancelled into with practice and time.
I for one am still learning and am not afraid to admit that. Many
of you mishima users will find it much harder to ANIMAL DASH and
CROUCH CANCEL with Roger as he is much faster at it than a Mishima
IMHO. Then again, you must also learn some throw commands on a whim,
so you can pull out huge moves. At the moment I have gotten the
Crouch Cancel into a GIANT SWING down, the motion is one of the easier
ones, as it contains the BACK press on the joystick.

The most underestimated move from Rogers CROUCH CANCEL is the SS.
It is devastating at the right time, and two sidesteps can leave
you behind an opponent that has just retaliated.

This is done as follows.

f,n,d,d/f,f,SS,f,SS etc..

This is a double sidestep, and can be of great use. It takes a little bit
of practice, and the f and second SS is completely un-necessary. This
is just an example.

- Crouch Canceling

The true CC is done simply by pressing ~u from the d position. It is used
in some of the bigger combo's for characters with larger reach, and even
a few of the combo's that are done in the combo section listed above.

- Custom Strings

This section is written by FIRESEAL. All credit due.

- Poking Strings for Roger

Well I will start off and say that Roger is a powerhouse when it comes
to poking. He has so many insane strings and juggles off of simple poke
starters. I will break down the strings I put in and say where you can
branch off into other combos/juggles/tactics. Here is how to set these
up.

d+1,n+2,f,f+1,2,d/f+1

Ok this is a basic fast poke string.  The d+1,n+2 is one of the fastest
pokes in the game and is all mid so no ducking.  The f,f+1,2 is a setup
for a sweet CH combo.  If you CH the f,f+1,2 you want to finish the
string f,f+1,2,1,2 then juggle with a quick f,f,u/f+4(insert u/f
juggle).  This can lead to some nice 50% or greater juggles.  The added
d/f+1 at the end of the string serves a dual purpose.  The first
purpose is that if you CH with it they are facedown not he ground and
you get guaranteed okizeme (Ali Kicks etc.) or any Okizeme game you
want to play.  The second purpose is if its blocked you are both pushed
a safe distance away and they cant retaliate with anything guaranteed.

f,f+1,2,f,2,1,hcf+1

Ok this is a great poking string that gives you some sweet damage.  As
I explained above if the f,f+1,2 cH's punish them.  If it doesn't they
will usually eat the giant swing tick(f,2,1,hcf+1).  Giant swing tick
is a sweet sweet move that you must mix in to your poking strings at
least a couple times a fight.

d/f+1,f,f+1,2,d/f+1,f,f,n+1

Ok now this string seems a bit awkward at first glance, but here is the
beauty of it.  A counter hit at any point means they hurt bad, and it
TRICKS them into getting countered.  They will think after the second
d/f+1 when you f,f, that they can d+1 counter you out of the 1,2 but
you instead hit them(hopefully CH) with the gut punch and get some nice
damage or at least a poke in.

f,f+2,d+1,n+2,d/f+1+2

This is just a plain and simple poke-a-thon.  They cant get in and
interrupt you unless they time in a fast jab perfectly.  The f,f+2
leads to more juggles on CH.

d+1,n+2,ss+4
d+1,n+2,ss(delay)4
d+1,n+2,ss,u/f+4

Ok now this is a nasty series of strings.  The d+1,n+2 pushes them a
bit away if it hits or if it doesn't then you go for the ss trip.  If
you land the trip there are plenty of nice juggles to do.  If the trip
is blocked... pray :)  The point of this exercise is to train them to
anticipate the trip.  Then the u/f+4 juggles come.  Remember that you
can delay the trip to hell and back to mix them up even more.

WD+2_f+4_hcf+1_1

Well I will end this section with the basic moves I use to make up any
good poking string with Roger.

d/f+1
f,f+1,2
d+1,n+2
f,f,n+2
f,f+2
d/f+1+2
f,f+4
d+1,d+4

Thank you FIRESEAL.

==============================================================================
11) Vs CHARACTER
================

This is were we tell you how to beat characters..

Alex/Roger:
----------

As with all mirror matches it comes down to a quick throw
combination fight. Whoever has initiative and the better
use of the character in general should win this. Otherwise
just read this faq a few times and try to utalise a few
more things. This doesn't happen often, but when it does
you will find most people think they can win solely with
the SS+4 and the AGF.


Angel/Devil:
___________

There is a big debate currently in Tekken Zaibatsu as to
weather this guy is better than Kaz. Its quite a read.

In my opinion, devil is one of the more basic of the
mishima's, both in use and in style. This isn't really
a downfall, it makes him just as devastating, if not more
so, than any of the other mishima's. The way to beat him
really is to break down his moves and watch for them.

Twin Pistons: Mishima's have a serious tracking problem to
there right side. This is no different. The twin pistons can
be ss for free damage, and even if the d/f+1 hits the 2 should
in a lot of cases whiff completely. This is a nice thought but
in reality you should keep your head up and use a lot of pokes
and leave the strings to short movements. Don't give him an
opening to use this move.

Other than that there isn't really much more to it than get in
and look for openings. As I said he is a very basic character,
meaning all his moves will be to the point. Short. And damaging.
Designed to kill opponents means you most likely want to stay
away from general throws, as the Twin Pistons will beat you out
in most cases. And watch out for his SS+2 which has bad recovery
and is the perfect opportunity for free damage.

Anna:
----

Stay low and away. Do headbutts whenever necessary to prevent
the reversal, and buffer easy reversed pokes. Try to pull out the AGF
whenever she goes to crouch, and mix it up with the CD+1+2.
Otherwise turn it into a gruelling poking match. The d+1, N+2
is a good choice of moves when it comes down to it. The more
SS+4 mixed up with a u/f+4 you do, the safer you are. The best
option is to throw her whenever you can. Otherwise, watch out
for her assassins dagger QCF+1, its fast, REAL fast. And as for
a poking war, your biggest advantage is that you have fast moving
pokes. Remember you can initiate your Crouchdash game with her.
It may be a good chance at survival, and against a master Anna
player, you may need to side step a lot more, and stay back,
luring Anna to come to you. If you can do this, then you
will have no problems pushing her back. Chances are, your
command throws should do enough damage to put her out of the game,
problem is, landing them.

Watch out for 3 main string moves.

d+1, N+4
d+4, 1
d+3, 2

These are the moves that she makes strings out of. So be weariful
of these.


Armour King:
__________


Whenever he Crouchdashes, he is either going to do the Black Knee
or the WGF ( black upper ), knee is mid, wgf is special mid.
So a simple d+1 will stop anything that may come out.
The clothesline from hell f,n,d,d/f+1, is a very
fast move, but it hits high. Try to duck the clothesline if
you can, cause if you get hit by it, you will go flying backwards.
Also watch out for his Black Shoulder. That can be very damaging.
After the black shoulder, forget the throw, it is very appealing
to see A. Kings side to you, but a quick poke, and anything that
may have done damage is then thrown out the window. Just do a
simple d+1. It is your best chance, as there is a large guessing
game after that on what is coming next. You can then do the N+2,
the FC, 1+2 or even the FC, F+2 for a juggle.

Else, he can poke just like the rest. Watch out for his D+1, and his
D+1, N+2 cause they can be annoying. Don't throw Head to Head cause you
will get poked first. And Vice Versa. If he try's to throw.
Keep in mind the Hop Kicks and the Low Dropkicks. They come out
of no-were. The hopkick is fast, it has good range, and damaging
juggles to follow. As for the low dropkick, again, if you stay
low, this should not be a problem. Don't try to low parry it,
chances are you will land flat on your face with sore ankles.
Otherwise, its a poke match.


Baek:
____

This guy is strings, LOTS and LOTS of strings. Watch out for his
WS strings, they come out fast, and don't stop. You don't want to
get juggled, because he can do some nice damage like that.
Just try to poke and block as much as you can. And anticipate
the next move. Sooner or later, he is going into a high move,
and that is your opening.

An advanced BAEK can wavedash, this is perhaps his highest
priority to get close, to land his dangerous strings. If
you get hit by the last hit of his ws, 3, 3, 4 his u/f+3+4
is a guaranteed hit, so be wary of that string. Baek has
a few low hitting moves, but during some point he must go
to a high hitting move, this is were the AGF comes in, for
big damage and string interrupts. Watch out for his d/b+3 also
as he can knock you on the ground and do some dangerous
okizeme with it.

REMEMBER: If the next move has the option of being Low, or a
mid hitting juggle starter, better to block mid. Unless you
know that the next move is low. Because, you would probably
be better off taking a low hit, than getting juggled for a
lot of mean damage.

Eddy:
----
I don't really know what to say about an advanced player.
When Eddy goes into a handstand position, he is very venerable.
But this does not mean rush in and smash him up as fast as you can,
no, this means, you must time yourself very carefully and try
to catch Eddy in between his strings.

The best moves against and Eddy players are as listed.

d+3+4,(4),(4)
SS+4
F+1+2
d/f+1+2
U/F+4
d+1, N+2
d+1
d+4         <-- Its a low kick.
d/b+3

And so on. Anything that hits fast and low, or mid, will
probably be ok. The thing is, you wont really have a problem
too much with smashing Eddys into the ground, the lag between
the moves should be enough to get in and waste them.

Otherwise, just poke if you get in close.
Oh, and CD is your best friend here, any high moves from Eddy
are fodder for the AGF!


Ganryu:
------

This guy AINT no joke nor jack. This guy can pull off some of the
most damaging juggles. Stay up, and watch for an opening, he is NOT
slow, so you have to be clever. Poke when you can, and watch out for
his punch parry. If you are caught by it, you cant chicken it, you
will take throw damage, and you are left with you back turned, and
he can pull of anything from a side kick, to a Head Rush F+1+2.
The way to escape the actual throw part of the reverse is to simply
hit 1 when you get parried, you can't escape the damage but this will
face you towards Ganny and stagger you backwards. Avoiding the BT
guessing game he can initiate.

Chances are, sooner or later, he is going to sit down in front of you.
There are two options here for Ganny. He has a Megaton
Palm, that hits mid for nasty damage, and also a arm sweep, that
he can turn into small juggles. If he does the splits, then he can
roll sideways, but this isn't too much of a threat. If he sits down
in front of you, you should do a d/f+1+2 straight away. You should not
let him get back up. If he does, its a guessing game, and that is
not what you want. Also, he will try to get you with his Sumo Push
d+1+2, if this hits, you will stagger backwards, and if it is blocked,
he is left with initiative. Although I don't recommend trying to stop
this move with a poke, you can try it if you feel necessary to stop
it. Also, keep in mind, that he has a fast sweep. It
is hard to sidestep, and has no sweep stun when blocked either. So
all in all, ganny here is a good character to use. The way to beat
him, is utilise the d+1 as often as you can. Sidestepping is an
excellent idea, if you manage to sidestep the f+1+2 summon rush
thingee then it will leave you on his side, if not behind him.
Also, his d+1 will be utilised as a defence, followed by a guessing
game of FC 1+2 and so on. When he crouches or goes down, get out
of the way, out of range, just move. Get into CD distance, and
wait for priority to ANIMAL DASH and murder Ganny.

If you get hit by the last bit of his WS+1+2, 1+2 the d/f+2+3
for him is GUARANTEED so be ready.


Heihachi:
________

A good heihachi player will have you on your toes all the time.
Don't go head to head with his crouch dashes. Chances are you'll
loose. Get the throws off, and roll whenever you are grounded
and think the stomps coming. Techrolling is a good idea sometimes
just to get away from a stomp happy opponent. But if your opponent
mixes up with hellsweeps.. Then you have a problem. Stay down,
and take the first hellsweep. Its better than taking the whole
two hellsweeps into an TGF. (I say 2, because most people know,
that the 3rd hellsweep will chances are, not connect.)

Watch out for his kicks, things like the standing CH 4 can be
lethal and damaging to say the least. Don't counter him on an
unblockable with your CH 4 because, it will do an automatic counter.
He still takes damage, which is funny to watch as an ending move I
might add.

His WGF hits special mid now, so don't be afraid to block it from
any height. If you a crouched, it will send you back a bit, and
you should be able to recover before he does anything too painful
to you. Just keep in mind a few things about his Crouch Dashes.

1. After a hell sweep, if there is a pause, the TGF is coming.
2. The second hellsweep is always blockable accept on counter.
3. The TGF has no Mid\Low kick after it.
4. The WGF is SPECIAL MID. NOT mid.

Heihachi has no d+1 poke, it is a tile splitter, BUT a good
Heihachi player will know that he has a d/b+1 poke. That is
just as good as the d+1 poke of other characters. He is BEST
played out crouch dash distance. Don't let him get into this
position. Chances are he will shadow step out of hellsweeps,
and stand back. His CD game is very good, so you want to poke
ALL his CD's. Make sure you don't let him get to CD distance.
Stay in his face and poke like mad. Don't let him do anything.
The Twin Pistons d/f+1,2 is a good juggle starter, be careful
of this. You should SS+4 whenever you feel a mid\high move
coming out. He wont stop in the middle of a Crouch Dash.
Or if he is wave stepping, again, a SS+4 should stop him.

Summary:
Remember, Heihachi is uncannily deadly from all angles, My advice,
is to SS+4 whenever you can, Keep in his face and poke him head
to head. His CD game is very good, don't let him use it.

Hwaorang:
________

Throw. Whenever you can, stop the momentum of his strings. Don't
go toe toe with strings, you will lose. And loose a lot of your
life to boot. His kicks are very fast, fast and deadly. Once
you are in the air, he will kick like crazy to keep you up there.

If you are against a string player, watch his strings carefully
for one round, or before you challenge, and learn the ones he uses,
then, its a simple matter of poking or throwing Hwoarang, and poking
in the small time he leaves open between string connections.
The secret is, a lot of moves hit mid\high. Very few of his
kicks will actually hit low. CD is an option, but only if you know
that the move coming hits high, else you are taking the risk of
getting kicked. The SS+4 is your best friend. Stay back out of
his way, and look for openings, and SS+4 or f,f,N+1 your way into
him.


Jack 2:
______

Raw Power. Watch out for his uppercuts, and SS moves, they can do
the damage. And he is faster than people estimate, so take care.
He has mostly the same moves as Mr M G Jack, with lack of a few
and gain of some others. Watch out for his Ram, it seems to go
down well with scrubs and masters alike, and also his SS arsenal.
The SS arsenal is high and mid, that doesn't mean stay low, cause
you will eat a double knuckle in the head and that would hurt.
No no, just SS and poke. Get in his face, and wait for a botch
up or Whiff. Then nail him. On Paper, should be easy. IRL, not
so much.


Jun:
___

I have scrub tactics, willing to insert a write up from anyone
that is playing a master JUN.

King:
____

Scrubs? Learn the breaks and beat them up. EASY.

Masters?? Get in close and poke. This is going to be a war,
and watch out for the multi's, default to {1} for your break
after you miss the first {2} break. Chances are, if there not
good, they will do the Giant Swing. Else watch their hands,
and if they do the Muscle Buster, default to {2} again.
All kings multis have {1} as a break in them.. Just learn that and
you should be fine against throwers.

Now, a master will utilise his pokes, and his strategically
moves. He has a fast hopkick, that leads into small damage
juggles, that can put a world of pain on if you get thrown
on the ground. The most preferred ground throw is the Head Bomber.
The break for it is {2} so if you are ground thrown, do this.

Poking kings are more annoying, they tend to use a lot of standing
pokes, more so, you should really be standing against king, if he
crouchdashes, poke with a d+1. Watch out, king has the d+1, N+2
as well, and its a little slower? Anyway, it is still devastating.
His new poke, is the d/f+1,2 that does an elbow sting, into a gutpuch.
This is stoped by poking yourself.

Ok, now, king likes to throw. Most of his damage come from throws.
The most used command throw is the Muscle Buster. A break of 1+2.
Then again, the other one is the giant swing. Which has a break of {1}
So an idea is to push 1, hold, and press 2 for a break. This should
break any throw that has a break of 1 or 1+2. Watch for the mid throw
moves that can leave you in a position that you can be ground thrown.

This is one time I must say, Poke like crazy, and GO head to head
with his crouch dashes. If he crouchdashes, do the same. He might
do the double knuckle out of the crouchdash, but your AGF will beat
him out of it anyway. And slap him with a counter to boot for good
damage. Don't go head to head with king throwing, being a King master
entitles you to know the breaks for king too, which are the same as
Rogers\Alexs so just stay safe, poke, SS+4 and Hopkick, and annoy
king into submission.


Kuma\Panda:
__________

Don't get hit by the fart. Easy as that. Nah, Kuma is a force to be
reckoned with. The new Bear Stance is very nasty, and can keep away
a bulldogging opponent really well, just be careful, he has a few
options from here, namely a bear fling, that hits mid, and also
a bear swipe, that is like a fast poke. If this hits, the harder
right hand swipe is unstoppable, and quite damaging, however, this
will take him out of the stance. Also, when he is in this stance,
he can not block at all. This is handy, cause you can CD into an
AGF which will hit for good damage.

Poke anything else he does, watch out for his demon paw uppercut.
I think everyone would agree that this IS his best juggle starter.
It can launch you up, for a quick tag or good damaging juggles.
So watch out. The circus roll is tagable, so if you get caught
by this, you can expect to be hit by the partner soon after.

His fastest poke is the f+1, which combos into a G-Clef Cannon.
The Cannon does good damage, juggles and is taggable, so watch
out. Else, his d+1 has an uncanny range, and is fast, so it will
stop pretty much anything you try and do if your not careful.

His f+1+2 hits high now, and is pretty much faster than T3 so
watch out. Do a lot of SS and WS moves. And really poke him to
submission. Break the Circus Roll whenever you can, and if
you don't, be ready for damage. Else, just be careful..



Kunimitsu:
_________

Watchout for the d/f+2 cause that's gonna hurt. Else you should
be pretty ok. Just keep an eye out for her tricky tactics.
She has the d+1+2 were she disappears into the floor for a bit,
and raises back up. The other disappearing act she does, she comes
out of the roof with unblockables. This is not actually that
dangerous, a standing 4 kick will stop her from hitting you
most of the time, the hit, though unlockable, follows a very
narrow path straight down. So anything to be hit by it, must be
directly under it. The other real damaging things are her
Poison Wind d+3+4, which is easy to avoid, and her SS+3+4.
Which is like Rogers SS+4 but not as cool. I have never faced
a good Kuni before, so do not know much. I think its a lot like
yoshi?

Law:
____

I have scrub tactics, willing to insert a write up from anyone
that is playing a master LAW.

Lei:
____

Kookie is the right word for this guy. A lot of people do the razor
rush into a stance (f,n+1,2,1,2,4) Just remember if Lei does the
last kick, he goes into a Crane stance were he CAN NOT block. There
are also (To my knowledge, I only just started playing lei) high
or low hits from the crane stance. Get low, and ready yourself for
a headbutt. That will stop most lei's in their tracks. If you are
against a HAHAHA lei, then you have a problem. Try to pull off as
much damage as you can. And make Lei come to you. If you have someone
who can Tag Slide, do this when you can.. Else, if they can slide and
the whole HAHAHA Lei thing is happening, wait till he does the HAHAHA
and slide him. Chances are he will do a MID punch to stop you and
will go off his feet. Otherwise, just look out for the RAVE SPIN,
(d/b+4,4) If he does this and you block, stay low and do an Animal
Headbutt. If Lei lies down FU/FA Do the Ali Kicks. Don't get near him
cause he could Rave Spin or Kangaroo Kick, just beat him up. That's
what Ali-Kicks are for. If he is lying FD/FA watch out for the slide.
All his moves are pretty much low, so go in carefully, stay low, and
get ready to block the slide attempt. The other thing, while I remember,
is don't attack a backturned one. It is bad for your health.
The other thing I have learned, is people tend to prefer certain moves
from certain stances, if you watch carefully, you may be able to
anticipate anything that may be coming.

Ling:
____

What to say, ling will stay low, REAL low, get in on her. She's fast,
so watch out for her WS+2 that can lead to a juggle. Her juggles
are FINATICAL so don't let her get you up. A lot of her moves are low.
Do a lot of Knuckle Bombs (F+1+2) and Ali-Kicks to keep her at her
distance, and a lot of Animal Headbutts (WC+1+2) To discourage her
from getting close. All in all this is a nasty battle. And should
not be taken lightly. If its a scrub thou, pulling out those dumb
Phoenix Stance, roll around throws, just duck and Animal Headbutt
till they die. Oh, and remember the most USEFUL move against ling.
USE the D+1 WHENEVER you need it. Its going to be a NASTY poking
game. The thing with ling, is a master will be all over the place,
don't try to throw a backturned ling, you are gonna get hurt somink
KRONIK. Ling can poke fast, and is made for poking, so you have to
be ready to unleash all your fast and low power moves at a distance
to prevent being juggled. A f,f,N+1 is the best thing against a back
turned ling. Else, good luck. Its gonna be a war.

Mokujin/Tetsujin:
_________________

See all Chars. Just learn the stances so you know who he is!!


Ogre:
____

Don't do the Rolling Animal Kicks, you will eat Bloody Scissors soo
fast. Keep out of his kicks, and watch out for his F+2 and his
f,f+2. The hand snap thingee can be sidestepped after the first block,
but that doesn't leave you with much initiative, if none at all.
D+1 helps a lot, also the AGF. Forget the Infinite Kicks, no one in there
right mind will do them. Or a smart person will do the first few hits,
which I might add does nasty damage.. And then stop. If they like
to continue them thou, a simple SS+4 will stop them very quickly.

A good idea is to watch out for his legs. They are very long, and
can be very damaging if your not careful. But any ogre will try
to initiate his crouch game, the range of moves from this position
is too good to give up. Also, when you are down, watch out for his
double fist cannon ball thing that he does. It hits grounded opponents
for more damage than I would appreciate taking, and that, other than
his SS+4 which is a type of sweep, is about the only ground hitting
moves he has, but don't think that is not enough, because it is.

If you get in close, throw him and get back out again. Its as easy as
that. A master will do a lot more of his kicks thou, and you will
have to go toe to toe in hopes that your jabs are faster..

True Ogre:
_________

This is a hard one, really hard. I'll have to do this one in the next
update cause this really does need special attention.

Yoshimitsu:
__________

Watch out for the d/f+2. Fastest uppercut in the game. And the juggles
with damage are VERY good. Just don't get caught. SS a lot, and hopkick.
This is really all you can do. A good Yoshi will have you lost in strings.
A bad one will do nothing but his Crap 10-String, which I might add can
be poked at 6 different points in time. Just don't let his dancing around
intimidate you. Get into him, and throw him around a bit. He has one
command throw, so learn to break it. And watch out for unblockables.
The unblockables have good tracking, so don't try to SS and get in close,
chances are your gonna get stabbed. At that wouldn't help at all..
Also, watch out for the Roo kick, that can lead to BIG juggles. If you
get caught by it thou, you must have been sleeping. Cause its SLOW..

Keep in mind that he has the sword slash for Okizeme, that can be
rolled sideways out of.



==============================================================================
12) CONCLUSION
==========================

Roger\Alex are fun players, and should be played as such. Don't get mad
if you loose, just learn and get better. There is no point in winning
when you don't learn more of how to win. Just get in there and have fun.
He can be VERY competitive when it comes to tourneys, so don't count him
out of those, and just get ready for people to laugh when they see who
you choose. Cause personally, I don't when I know a good Roger\Alex is
standing next to me. I know I am about to be in a new world of pain.
