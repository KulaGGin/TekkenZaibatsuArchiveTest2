I.INTRODUCTION
	
Let's get this out of the way already: I do not, in any way, claim to be a good/expert 
Baek player. I just believe that I've played enough to be familiar with him, and in the 
process be able to give tips and some tricks to other Baek players. (And because there's 
not a single Baek FAQ on www.tekkenzaibatsu.com)

Going into Flamingo Stance cancels the last hit. Baek can cancel the Flamingo
Stance into some of his regular moves regular moves. If you are looking to cancel into a 
Punch or Right Kick attacks you can just input the proper command. It gets a little 
trickier if you want to cancel into Left Kick attacks or Double Kick attacks. In order to do 
this you have to keep holding down Left Kick as you go into Flamingo. For the chart below 
lets assume you did F+1,2,3 to go into Flamingo and you are now holding Forward and Left Kick.

III. SOME MOVES IN-DEPTH

I won't be listing all the moves in the moves list since I don't use all of them. I will just 
include those moves that I use in my game. Each move is given a rating of 1 to 5 stars, with 
5 stars meaning that the move is very effective (for me, at least). 

1,1 | Twin Jabs | ****
   What can I say? It's a basic 1,2 jab. It's fast (10 frames), and gives a +1 frame advantage 
on block. On a hit, it gives +9+9. 

---
1,2 |Double Punch| ****
   It has the same use as the 1,1 move, but it gives you a lot of options afterwards like:

   = 3,[~f_~b] |High Kick| ***
	The *** is for the Flamingo cancel option. 

   = 3,4<3~5 |Launching Rocket| ***
	This move hits h,l,m, but if you use this all the time, the 4 will get parried. You 
        can delay the final 3, though, and it's a class 2 juggle starter. Just remember to 
        delay it once in a while to screw up your opponent's timing.

   = 3,3,4<4<3[~f_~b] |Black Widow| **
        If your opponent doesn't duck all the highs, then the delayable kicks can be pretty
        effective. 
	
---
b+1 |Stealth Needle| *****
   This move is very nice. It's an anti-SS move. It also has Baek doing a SSR during the 
animation. This move counterhits easily. I don't know why, but it seems to have the priority 
over a lot of moves. This is very useful especially during your Flamingo SS mix-ups. More on 
that on the FLAMINGO SIDESTEP MIX-UPS section.

---
b+2 |Bolt Cut| ***
   This seems to be an anti-SS move, too. It's like a backfist done in reverse. On a CH, the
opponent gets knocked down, and you get a free d+3,3,N+3. Some people use d+4,3,3 instead, 
but it sometimes misses. Try it after a SSL, and if it hits, go for a right side throw since 
you get a +9 frame advantage. This move is great. Too bad it hits high.

---
u/f+2 |Bone Stinger| ***
   It's a bit slow (26 frames) and hits high, but it if gets blocked, you get a +9 frame adv.
Go for a throw, or it the opponent wises up, do any mid move.

---
f,N,d,d/f+3~5 |Wing Blade| ***
   Whereas Bob's CD+4 is a class 1 juggle starter only on regular-sized characters, his 
master's CD+3 launches even the big robots way, way up. On a tag, that is. If you do a CD+3 
without the ~5, big characters don't get launched as high. Maybe it's a class 1.5 (no such 
thing) on biggies. You can use this move pretty often since the opponent gets pushed back a 
bit if Wing Blade gets blocked, leaving you relatively safe from retaliations. I'll give it 
**** if only it is as quick as Bob's--23 frames compared to 16. 

---
3,4<3~5 |Launching Rocket| ***
   This is the same move as the one listed above. Only this time you get to do the 3,4<3 
without first doing 1,2. The effect is the same... it's a class two juggle starter. Always
feel free to delay the 3. Or, you can stop at 4 (recover crouching) and then get into your 
FC game.

---
WS+3,3<4 |Wave Needle| ****
   I use this one pretty often. This is the same as Baek's Flamingo Stance (FS) 3,3<4. The 
only difference is that the first 3 hits high, while the one from FS is mid. The 4 hits 
low and it kinda knocks the opponent off his/her feet. If you connect with the 4, you get a 
free u/f+3+4. 

---
(FC_d)+3,3,d+3 |Snake Creep| ****
   This move hits LLL. Nice. Just don't abuse this since more and more people can block the 
second 3. 

---
(FC_d)+3,3,N+3~5 |Snake Blade| ****
   It hits LLm. Mix this one up with Snake Creep. This can drive some people nuts if they 
can't block it correctly. Experts can see the mix up and block correctly, though. This one 
is also effective in terms of okizeme.

---
f,f+3 |Hunting Axe| ***
   This one is too slow for me. It acts like the Mishimas' f,f+3. You can do a d+3,3,N+3 or
a d+4,3,3 if you hit with it.

---
u/f+3,4,3 |Hunting Hawk| ***
   It's pretty much like Bob's own u/f+3,4,3. It hits mmh, and you get a +7 frame adv. I don't
think there's anything guaranteed after it. You're safe from retaliation, though. You can do
this as the opponent tags in if you're too far away for a CD+3.

---
u/f+3+4_3+4 [~f_~b] |Flashing Halberd| ***
   This hits h,h, but it's fast. It takes 16 frames to hit, but I've read that the u/f+3+4
version is one frame faster. If you hit with this the opponent gets knocked down quite hard,
thus not allowing them to techroll. They can hold F and spring forward, though. Do this move
after connecting with WS+3,3<4. It combos and if your opponent doesn't hold F, do a CD then a
f,f+4_d/b+4. It's guaranteed to hit. If he does hold F, he can block either move, so do a CD
Albatross instead.

---
d/b+4 |Heel Axe| ****
   If this one CH's or hits a crouching opponent, I believe another one is sure to hit. This 
is the move to use if you manage to train the competition to stay on the ground after being 
juggled. This move hits M, so I think this does more damage on an opponent on the ground 
rather than one who is rolling away.

---
b+4 |Heel Lance| ***
   This one looks like Bob's LFS b+4, only Baek's version doesn't juggle. What a shame...
This one can be used in okizeme, too, but it's not that great there. You can use this one
on your FS sidestep game. This one pushes away a BT opponent.

---
f+4<3[~f_~b] |Heel Knife| ****
   This one is for playing keep-out. Use it at medium range, since it's a bit on the slow 
side. You can either delay it, or go into FS. If I'm not mistaken, if the 3 CH's, it stuns,
and you get a free d/b+3+4 (if the opponent doesn't break out of the stun). 

---
d/f+4~4<3 _ WS+4<4<3 _ CD+4<4<3[~f_~b] |Albatross| **********
   This is THE move. It hits mmm, is delayable all throughout, stuns on CH, guaranteed on any 
hit, and is cancelable into FS. All 3 versions are cancelable into FS if you do a ~f_~b. The 
best one is WDA (Wavedash Albatross). Yeah, Baek can wavedash, too. Here's a brief explanation 
of Albatross's properties:
   Delayable: This move is pretty safe to do all the way even when blocked, but if you're not
sure, you can just do a CD+4. You can still continue the move even after checking if it gets
blocked or not. That's how long the delay window is.
   Stuns on CH: The 3 stuns on CH, and a d/b+3+4 unblockable is guaranteed. Or, you can do 
another WDA.
   Guaranteed on any hit: The whole string is guaranteed to hit whenever you connect with the
first or second 4 (kinda like the Mishima 1,1,2's). Even when you delay the hits, they're 
still sure to hit.

---
(FC_d)+4,3,3,3[~f_~b] |Baek Rush| *****
   The d+4,3 part is a great poking tool. This hits lmmm. At 12 frames, it's pretty fast for 
a kick attack. This can be very effective in your okizeme tactics. Another plus is it's 
cancelable-to-FS property.

---
(FC_d)+4,3,3,d+3 |Baek Needle| *****
   You can mix this one up with Baek Rush to make your opponent guess how to block correctly
at the end of the strings. 

---
b+3 |Flamingo Stance| *****
   It's a great evasive move. The move has a built-in SSR property to it. 

---
b+1+2 [~B] |High/Mid Puch Parry| *****
   I prefer parries over reversals since parries are final and cannot be chickened. What makes
Baek's pucnh parry even better is that a d/f+2 uppercut is sure to hit afterwards. A word of
warning: be sure to release the stick to neutral after pressing 1+2 or you'll go into Flamingo
Stance. If that happens and you're not expecting it, you'll quickly lose the advantage you've
gained.

---
d/f+2 |Regular Uppercut| *****
   IMHO, this is Baek's best juggle starter. It's fast, and is guaranteed after his punch
parry. It doesn't launch the biggies (except True Ogre?), but you can quickly jab them,
and they'll float as well as the others. 
   After a low kick parry, d/f+2 is also guaranteed, but it won't juggle. This is because
Baek's uppercut can't launch crouching opponents. The uppercut would cause a stagger back
animation, though, and you can follow-up with an u/f+3+4, provided that you're close enough
so it won't whiff. Refer to u/f+3+4's entry for follow-ups.



IV. FLAMINGO THROW

   In order to make you FS sidestep game effective, you have to master Baek's Flamingo throw. 
It's the same as his normal f+2+3 throw, though when you do it in FS, the escape command 
becomes 1+2. The moves list says it's done FS 2+3. I don't know if this is true since I can't 
do it that way. The way I input the command is 
		
		F+[2]~3

That is, press 3 immediately after pressing and holding F+2. That may sound so simple, but 
believe me: lots of people find it hard to do, and I'm one of them. It took me about a week 
before finally getting the timing down.
   Practice doing the throw first as soon as you enter FS (b+3). Press b+3, then do F+[2]~3.
Actually, you don't have to input the command as soon as you are in FS. Try doing b+3, then 
hold F or B to make Baek hop a couple of times. Then, as he finishes his hop animation, do the 
throw. It will come out all the time. 
   You can also do F+[2]~3 after a FS sidestep. The motion is b+3, SSR, then F+[2]~3. 
   Once you master the timing, try doing the Flamingo throw after you cancel a move into FS.
The easiest one would be F+1,2,3, [2]~3. All you have to do is press [2]~3 (while still 
holding down F) a split second after the F+1,2,3. On other FS-cancel moves, the timing gets 
trickier. You have to wait until you see Baek raise his leg up fully before inputting F+[2]~3.
   If you have a hard time doing the throw, try pressing [2]~3 a little faster. 


V. FLAMINGO STANCE CANCELLING TECHNIQUES

   This refers to Baek's ability to cancel certain strings into his Flamingo Stance. These
certain strings are all those moves in Section II that have "[~f_~b]" on them. The only 
attacks that are cancellabe to FS are 3's. That is, all left kicks, which makes sense, since 
it's his left leg that is raised when he enters FS. When you input a "3~f", what you're 
actually doing is cancelling the kick, so that instead of kicking [???], you just raise your 
left leg, and go into Flamingo Stance. Trying to do a [~f_~b] to cancel a string into FS is a 
bit hard. It requires you to time the [~f_~b] carefully right after you input the last 3 which 
you are trying to cancel into FS. I say, don't try doing that. There's a simpler way. All you 
have to do is to make sure that you are holding F as you cancel a string into FS. 

   (Note: F# means holding F until another directional command is to be entered. If there
    is none, just hold F until the entire command sequence is finished.)

   Let's take Baek's 1,2,3~f Double Punch, High Kick [Flamingo] string as an example: Doing
what the command says means inputting four commands: 1, 2, 3, and then ~f. You can easily
time the ~f incorrectly such that the High Kick comes out. So, instead of doing the listed
command, do F#+1,2,3. That is 1 input shorter than 1,2,3~f. Plus, you're 100% sure that the
3 is going to be cancelled. The same goes for all the other strings with " [~f_~b]". 
Cancelling f+4<3, for example, is exactly the same as the Double Punch string. You simply 
hold F until you press 3.
   But what about strings which don't start with a F like d+4,3,3,3[~f_~b] or d/f+4<4<3? The
timing is still pretty easy. You can input and hold F pretty much anytime before the last 3.
Let's say you want to cancel d+4,3,3,3--you can do d+4,F#+3,3,3, or maybe d+4,3,F#+3,3, or
d+4,3,3,F#+3. All these commands would cancel the last 3 and make Baek go into FS.

   Now that you're into FS, what moves can you do? Beside all of Baek's FS Arts, you can
do almost all of his Regular Stance moves. Well, except for moves with more than one
directional input like f,f+4. Another exception are moves that start with u/f like u/f+2
and u/f+3,4,3.
   To input a command with no directional input, you have to press and hold F. For example,
if you are in FS and want to do a 1,1, you have to do F+1,1. Or, if you did F#+1,2,3, and 
want to do a simple 4, just keep holding F, and press 4 (that is, F#+1,2,3, 4). The f seems 
to act like a signal telling the computer that you're doing a regular stance move. Also, you 
can press b, intead of pressing and holding F. This is useful if you're going to do any move 
that starts with a "b". Let's say you did b+3 to enter FS and you want to follow it up with 
a b+4. So instead of pressing f or b, the move already starts with a "b" so all you have to 
do is input b+4 already.
   In the case of moves that don't start with a "f" or "b", just do a "f" before entering
the appropriate command for the move. So, in order to do a d/f+4<4<3 while in FS, do
FS f, d/f+4<4<3. Or if you entered FS by cancelling a string like d+4,3,3,3, this is what 
you have to do: d+4,F#+3,3,3, d/f+4,4,3. Again, you no longer have to input an additional
"f" before the d/f+4,4,3 since the "f" is already taken care of by the F#. 
   To do moves starting with a "3" while in FS, the input is a bit trickier. What you have 
to do is to input a 3+4 in place of the "3". So if you're going to do a d+3,3,3 after going
into FS, you should input b+[3] (to enter FS), d+3+4,3,3. The trick here is to hold down 
the 3 and then press 4. 

   This is where Baek's infinite strings come in. To do an "infinite string" you basically
input one FS-cancelable string after another. One example is F#+1,2,3, d+4,F#+3,3,3, d/f+4,
4,3. Another one, and it's also the easiest, is: F#1,2,3, 1,2,3, 1,2,3, etc. Note: if you 
can't do the infinite string, your timing is off. You have to wait until you see Baek's 
left leg fully raised before you input the next string. BTW, just because you can do 
infinite strings doesn't mean you have to abuse them. I recommend doing just 2 strings in 
a row. A good one would be CD+4<4,F#3, d+4,3. 
   Keep in mind that when you do cancel a string into FS, you can always do a FS throw (or 
a quick d/f+1). Let's say you do F#+1,2,3. Instead of doing another string after the FS 
cancel, do a [2]~3. Again, you don't have to input another "f" since you're already holding 
F (because of the F#). I may seem too repetitive, but I just want to give stress to the use 
of the F# command in Baek's entire FS cancel game.



VI. FLAMINGO SIDESTEP MIX-UPS

   This part is centered around Baek's double sidestep game. Keep in mind that Baek can
do only a double sidestep to the right because he has only one Flamingo Stance (left). Input 
a b+3 to make Baek do a SS to the right, and then do a regular SSR (d, when you're on the 
left side of the screen, and u when on the other side). After a double SS, you've got a lot 
of options:

F+[2]~3    --> Flamingo throw. You can train the opponent to duck with this one. Since the 
	       escape command is 1+2, the opponent may think it's just better to duck it.
               If you manage to catch them on their left side, always tag out to your
 	       partner for extra damage.
b+1        --> You can do this after a b+3 (single ss) since the b+1 already makes Baek 
	       sidestep to the right. This hits mid, thus training the opponent to block mid.
d/f+1      --> This is a quick mid uppercut, and it gives a +1 frame adv. on block. Just
  	       remember that you have to press "f" before doing the d/f+1.
f+1,d/f+2  --> If you ever end up behind your opponent after a 2SS, do this. It seems as if
               the d/f+2 launcher is guaranteed after you connect with the f+1.
d+1        --> Again, remember to press f first. This one starts your FC game.
d+4,3      --> A nice poke
FS 3,3,4   --> This is great when you hit the opponent's side. You are sure that the 
 	       low-hitting 4 won't be blocked. just don't be tempted to follow it up with
               an u/f+3+4 since you will WHIFF most of the time. 
   

VII. JUGGLES

   A lot of these juggles come from ZAIBATSU'S Baek combo movies.

d/f+2,
   F#+1,2,3, 1,2,3, N+4
   F#+1,2,3, 1,2,3, 1,2,3, N+4         (Both hits of 3+4 connect on big characters, while 
 				        the second whiff on regular-sized characters)
   F#+1,2,3, 1,2,3, N+1,2,3,4          (You let go of F so that you don't cancel the last 
                                        string)
   F#+1,2,3, 1,2,3, 1,2,[3], d/b+4     (The unblockable hits if the opponent techrolls or 
                                        tags out)

   u/f+3+4, WDA                  (if the opponent holds F)


* CD+4,4,F#+3 and d+4,F#+3,3,3 are a great way to set up your okizeme game. Do the WDA and
  cancel the 3 into FS and then do a d+[3]+4,3,3 or a d+4,3,3,F#+3 if the opponent techrolls. 
  The d+4,3,3,3 string is better since you'll have the chance to repeat it after going back 
  to FS. If the opponent stays on the ground, do a d/b+4.
