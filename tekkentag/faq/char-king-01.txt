= Introduction to Tekken Tag Tournament =
=========================================

If you need further elaboration on TTT, I suggest the following:

Tekken Zaibatsu: http://www.tekken.net/zaibatsu
Tekken Salute: http://salute.consolenation.com
TTT Official Web Site: http://www.tekkentagtournament.com/
Fighters.net: http://www.fighters.net/namco/tekken/index.html
Catlord's TTT Movelist: http://tekken.net/catlord/ttt/tttmoves.txt

These web sites deal with TTT and Tekken 3.  These sources should get youa 
acclimated with TTT.  The first three sites have forums where you can discuss 
TTT.  You can find me on those forums as "SmuvMoney".

"The Official Tekken 3 Ultimate Guide – Arcade Edition" by Versus Books 
(http://www.vsbooks.com)
"The Unauthorized Tekken 3 Fighting Guide (for Playstation and Arcade)" by Ben 
Cureton (Tragic) 

Even though these books were written for Tekken 3, there are enough similarities 
between Tekken 3 and TTT that warrant their usefulness.  However, I'm not sure 
if you may be able to find copies of either guide at this time.

I write this FAQ from the perspective that you have little knowledge about King 
II but some knowledge about TTT.  If anything goes over your head, you can 
probably find information on it from any of the above sources.  You can also 
view the Acknowledgements under BIBLIOGRAPHY for more sources of information.

===================================
= Introduction to King The Second =
===================================

King the Second (King II) is the successor to King I, the Mexican wrestler in 
Tekken 1 and 2.  According to the Tekken 3 story, King I is killed by Ogre.  
King II dons the jaguar mask to help the orphanage that King I left behind.

In case you're wondering why I choose King, it's simple - He is King; hence he 
RULES! =D Seriously, King II is a grappler first and foremost, but don't let 
that stop you from using his other moves.  He juggles well and can keep an 
opponent frustrated while standing or on the ground.  King can beat his opponent 
without throws - the threat of a throw can mess up your opponent's game.

==========
= Legend =

The format is loosely based on Catlord's and Tragic's numeric Tekken notation.

===================
= Universal Moves =
===================

Not knowing how to use moves universal to TTT can be sometimes be the difference 
in close matches.  This section breaks those moves down.

---------------------
- Moving & Blocking -
---------------------

This may be a little basic for some people, but it gets more complex later.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Basic Movement ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Move Forward                        f_F                                  
Dash Forward                        f,f                                 
Run                                 f,f,f_f,F               WR

Dashing and moving forward give range to your moves especially those with an f,f 
motion.  If you do the f,f motion slowly, you'll get more range.  Do it quickly 
to do it faster.  Certain moves can only be done while running (see below).

Move Backward                       b                                   
Dash Backward                       b,b                                 

Even though I don't encourage this as a general strategy, you can dash backwards 
to avoid attacks.  However, you will be unable to block for a moment.  You can 
instead throw out attacks and even sidestep during the lag.

Sidestep                            u~N_d~N                 SS

Added in Tekken 3, sidestepping allows characters to avoid moves when used 
correctly.  All characters have moves that can be only initiated from a 
sidestep.  Sidesteps can set up side throws and juggles.  However, a poor 
sidstep can cause you to walk into an attack and eat minor/major counter hit 
damage.  In general, if the opponent throws out a move using a right limb that 
will hit you on your left side, you sidestep to your right (SSR) and vice versa 
for your opponent's left limb attacks (SSL).  Some moves can not be sidestepped 
(Yoshimitsu's 3_f+3) while others can be avoided with an SSL or SSR (Armor 
King's f+1+4).  However, this should work to avoid most moves.  Check the chart 
below to show you how to SSL/SSR based on what direction you're facing:

     SSU  SSD
   +----------+ 
1P | SSL  SSR |
   |          |
2P | SSR  SSL |
   +----------+

Hop                                 ub_u_uf                             
Jump                                UB_U_UF

A hop is a short, quick leap.  A jump is a higher, further leap.  You can jump 
over your opponent, but you can't hop over unless they are grounded AFAIK. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Blocking ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Passive High Block                  N                       sM_M_H      
Active High Block                   b_B                     sM_M_H      
Passive Low Block                   d_D                     sM_L        
Active Low Block                    db_DB                   sM_L        
   
Second in importance to basic movement is blocking.  Passive or neutral blocking 
works for one or two hits especially if the opponent is stringing attacks.  At 
that point, you will need to active block appropriately to avoid taking damage.

Low Parry/Thrust Block *!*          df                      sM_L        

New to TTT, all characters now have a low parry.  Simply move the joystick to df  
when a low or special mid attack is about to hit you.  Unlike other parries, it 
has no miss animation.  It leaves the opponent stunned for a short time but no 
attack is guaranteed.  If you mistime the low parry, you will probably get hit.  
However, learning to use this can save you a lot of worry about high/low mixups.  
It is best used on moves that you know are coming that special mid or low.

Crouch                              db_d_df                 WC               
Crouch Walk                         DB_DF                   RC WC

The crouch evades all high attacks and throws.  All characters can walk forward 
or backward while crouching without a crouch dash.  Simply hold DF_DB and your 
character will take baby steps in the appropriate direction while crouching.

While Crouching                     DB_D_DF                 WC            
Modified WC                         d~db_d~df               m-WC            

Many moves can only be done from a crouching position.  When your character is 
in a full crouch (WC), it can perform the attack.  However, there is a quicker 
way to do WC moves.  You can go to down and then go to db_df to do the move.  
This is especially true for moves that have a WC,df motion - you can do a d,df 
or DF motion to execute it without having to wait for a full crouch animation.

Crouch Dash                         f,N,d,df                            
Rolling Dash                        d,df,f
Sway                                d,db,b[~N]                          

There are several characters that have a crouching version of a forward dash, a 
crouch dash.  The character will quickly advance while keeping their head low, 
which avoids high and some mid attacks.  Many characters including King can set 
up many throws and attacks from a crouch dash.  Some characters have a rolling 
dash, which is similar to a crouch dash except it recovers high.  Other 
characters have a backward crouch dash or a sway.  The opponent will dash 
away and/or lean back while crouching before standing up and attacking.
                    
While Standing                      WC~N                    WS                            
Modified WS                         N,d,df,N_N,d,db,N       m-WS                                
Rolling Modified WS                 N,d,df,f_N,d,db,b       m-WS                               

Many moves can only be done while standing (WS) from a crouch (WC).  However, 
other methods for WS moves are possible in TTT.  If you perform a N,d,df~N+ANY 
motion, you perform a WS move even though you didn't fully crouch.  Your 
character bobs down slightly and then pops up and does the WS move.  The 
"modified" notion (m-) comes from the fact that you are never fully crouched.  
It is based from a similar principle in Virtua Fighter.  The neutral at the 
beginning is technically optional but makes it easier to do.  Note that this 
motion is almost the same as a crouch dash or sway except for a last step.  In 
fact, you can do a WS move out of a crouch dash/sway (if your character has 
one), which makes perfect sense since the motions are so alike.  You can do a 
QCF_QCB to do some WS moves.  However, if the character already has moves that 
use QCF_QCB, you will not get WS moves using this method  - you will perform the 
other move instead.  An example would be Paul's Death Fist (d,df,f+2).  If you 
want a m-WS+2 Palm Lift, then perform a N,d,db,b+2 or N,d,db,N+2 motion.

- Throws -
----------

Left Front Throw                    1+3                     Left FT {1}  
Right Front Throw                   2+4                     Right FT {2} 
Tag Throw *!*                       2+5                     Tag FT {2}   

Each character has at least 7 throws for standing opponents: left front, right 
front, generic tag, left side, right side, back, and at least one other front 
throw.  The generic tag throw allows you to switch partners safely while 
damaging your opponent.  It is an over-the-shoulder toss into a pounce or ground 
attack by the partner.  There are other team/partner specific tag throws.

Left Side Throw                     1+3_2+4                 Left ST {1}  
Right Side Throw                    1+3_2+4                 Right ST {2}

Each character has side throws from the opponent's left and right.  Some side 
throws allow a tag out.  To avoid a side throw, escape with 1 if they are on 
your left or vice versa with 2.  To set up a side throw, you can sidestep an 
opponent or hit the opponent with a move that forces their side to you.

Back Throw                          1+3_2+4_2+5             BT {-}       

All back throws are inescapable, but they can be crouched under except for the 
tackle.  Every character has at least one back throw. If you use the tag throw 
from behind, you don't tag throw the opponent – you do the 2+4 back throw.

Reverse Throw                       BK 1+3_2+4              BKT {1_2_-}  

The opposite of a back throw is a reverse throw.  It is a throw peformed while 
your back is turned.  The ensuing throw is the same throw the player would 
do if not turned around.  The escapes are the same as your standard throws.

- Ground Recovery -
-------------------

Unfortunately, there will be times when you are on the ground trying to get up.  
If you have trouble getting up without your opponent tagging you a few times 
first, then this section is right up your alley.

Hop Up *!*                          ~u                      FD/FA M       

When knocked down by most moves, you can quickly get up or roll away when you 
touch the ground.  This is tech get up or tech recovery.  Perform the command 
when you touch the ground.  Certain moves do not allow a tech get up, but it is 
best to see if you can tech to avoid further punishment.  In TTT, you can tech 
recover from longer range knockdowns like Nina's Blonde Bomb (f,f+1+2).  You can 
only tech roll from a long range throw like Nina's uf+1+2, i.e., no hop up.
 
Back Spring  *!*                    ~b                                           
Slide Back Up *!*                   ~D/B_d/b+2                          

In TTT, you can also tech get up violent knockdowns like Bryan's Mach Punch 
(f,f+2) and rollback knockdowns like Paul's Deathfist on counter (QCF+2 CH).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Normal Recovery ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you can not tech get up or you choose to not tech.  As with Tech Get 
Up, there are times when it is better to tech than not.  Like the Rock says, 
know your "Roll" and you'll be OK (bad pun - sheesh ;p).

Speed Up Recovery                   2                                   

This is listed in the PSX Tekken 3 manual and it seems to work in TTT.  It 
allows you to gain control of your character while knocked down.  It works after 
knock down stuns.  Use in conjunction with the get-up techniques listed below.  
If you stand straight up using this, it is usually best to block low as most 
people would have been trying to foot sweep your recently grounded character.

Tag Out *!*                         5

When you tag out from the ground, your character gets up and attempts to run 
offscreen.  You can be hit while onscreen so make sure you can get away clean. 
 
Stand Up                            u                                  
Rising Low Kick                     3                       LG FD/FT JG                        
Rising High Kick                    4                       M          

Regardless of ground position, you can get up with a mid or low attack or stand.  
Note that the Rising Low Kick from FD/FT can be used to start juggle combos.  
Both the high and low kicks can be reversed or parried respectively.

Rising Feet Lunge                   b,b+3+4                 FU/FT M GB KD

Certain characters including King can spring up from FU/FT position and attack 
legs first.  This is known as the Rising Feet Lunge.  Not all characters have 
this move.  If it is blocked, it causes a small guard stun.  If it hits, it 
knocks down.  For King, this will leave him with his back turned.
     
Ankle Lightning Kick                d+3_d+4                 FU/FT L      

If you need to get up with an attack that will stop the opponent cold and allow 
you to get up cleanly, the Ankle Kick can be used.  It will briefly stun your 
opponent.  If you miss, you will be punished as the recovery is bad.  I don't 
think the ankle kick can be parried, but King could reverse this in Tekken 3 - I 
haven't tried this in TTT.  They may have fixed that though.  Note that this 
only works from FU/FT with no rolling beforehand.

= Rising Feet Lunge                 = b,b+3+4               FU/FT M BK  

Even though the forward/backward roll has its uses, be careful using this 
against certain characters (King for instance).  You can be hit while rolling, 
which means a juggle and/or minor/major counter damage.  Know when to roll and 
not roll.  If you can roll forwards/backwards freely, then the flying cross chop 
becomes a good move to use since it causes either a guard stun when blocked or a 
knockdown if not blocked.  Note that the Cross Chop can only be used if you are 
FU/FT. After a forward/backward roll by itself, you will stand up.

    = Recover Crouching                 = ~D                L

You have the most options if you choose to roll to the side.  You can do almost 
anything mentioned in the previous sections.  After the initial side roll, you 
can choose to tag, stand up, attack, or roll forwards/backwards.  If you choose 
to turn over to a face down position (FD/FT_FD/FA), you have the same options as 
if you were knocked face down initially.  Note that you can't do a Flying Cross 
Chop or an Ankle Kick once you roll over, but you can still roll forwards or 
backwards and do almost anything else.

You will need to know when and how to get up.  You can chain various wake-up 
moves and attacks from any roll - the side roll having the most options.  Most 
of the options off the side roll can be done on their own off of the 
forward/backward roll or without a roll.  Knowing how to get up can be the 
difference between a win and a loss.  It's not something I can easily explain, 
but it is necessary for TTT success.

-------
- Tag -
-------

The largest and most important innovation to TTT is the ability to tag in a 
partner.  As with ground recovery, you must know when to and when not to tag.  
You can tag almost anytime except while being thrown, juggled, or in certain 
types of stuns/staggers.  Since everything is new to Tekken in this section, I 
will avoid using *!* before all the moves.

Standing Tag                        5                       H_L         
Ground Tag                          5                                   
Tech Tag                            ~5                      TR            

Standing, ground, and tech tags are probably the ones you will be using the 
most.  Note when you tag out, the character leaving can still be hit until 
he/she is fully off screen.  Make sure it is safe to tag or you will get hurt.

Stun Tag                            5                       DS_FS

If you are caught in a double-over stun or fall-over stun (DS_FS), you can 
Immediately press tag to tag out and avoid being juggled.

Tag Throw                           2+5                     Tag FT {2}   

All characters have a generic tag throw that allows a safe tag to their partner 
while damaging the opponent.  The throw itself is an arm drag takedown followed 
by another move from your partner that hits grounded opponents.  You can not get 
up before the partner hits you.  You can escape the initial tag throw with {2}. 

Tag Run Cancel                      ub,b                                
= Tag                               = 5                                 
Tag Dive                            f,f,N+1+2               M GB KD        
Tag Slash Kick                      f,f,N+3                 M GB KD
Tag Slide                           f,f,N+4                 LG          

Are you the person who tags in your partner only to get mugged by the other 
team?  Well, you can prevent that with tag in moves.  Being able to perform tag 
in moves is vital to TTT survival.  You can do a dive, kick, or slide to avoid 
damage.  You can also perform character specific moves.  Tag moves can be 
buffered offscreen so that the character comes onscreen performing the move.

TTT allows for tag juggles where both team members are involved.  It involves a 
move that can be tagged from followed by the partner finishing off the juggle.  
Besides looking cool, tag juggles have another interesting and important 
feature: they reduce the red healing portion of the life bar.  The red portion 
of the life bar is the maximum amount a character can heal while not being used.  
Taking this away can help prevent comebacks later from a healed up tag partner.

These are other universal moves you may have to use or defend yourself against.

= Tackle                            = N                     sMBT {-}

If you're running at a standing opponent, you will automatically tackle at 
midrange and shoulder block at far range.  If they are grounded, you will run 
and stomp them.  If an opponent is running at you, it usually means bad things 
for you.  You can hit people out of running attacks, but it is not easy to do.  

Not all characters have these all the running moves.  King doesn't have the Side 
Kick or the Leg Sweep.  King will do a standing 3 instead of a Side Kick (do a 
WR 3+4 drop kick instead).  King will do a Stagger Kick instead of a Leg Sweep.

~ Jumping Attacks ~

Hop Attacks                         (ub_u_uf)+1_3_4         M_H_M         
Pounce Attacks                      (ub_u_uf)+2             MG         

For most characters, uf+4 is a hop kick that juggles.  A uf+1 is a hop punch 
that sometimes knocks down but doesn't juggle.  The uf+3 is usually a jumping 
spin kick or high kick that hits high rather than mid unlike the other two.  All 
hopping right punches produce a downward punch pounce that hits grounded 
opponents.  Most characters have better attacks to hit grounded opponents.

Jumping Midkick                     (UB_U_UF),N+3           M FS KDch      

The UF,N+3 kick actually causes a fall over stun so it is worth mentioning.  The 
other jumping attacks are similar to their hopping versions.  If you counter 
hit, it knocks the opponent away in most cases.

Tackle Flip Reversal                1+2                                 

If you are ever tackled from the front, you can either dodge the tackle during 
the initial impact for no damage {2} or flip the tackler over before you touch 
the ground {1+2}.  If you flip the tackler over, you can start attacking as if 
you tackled that person.  In the case of King, you can do any Ultimate Tackle 
follow up.  If you are tackled from behind, then you can not escape the initial 
impact or the falling down.

Front Tackle Left Punch Block       2
Front Tackle Right Punch Block      1

If you block the opponent's punches when tackled, you will throw them off of you 
and receive no further damage.  From a front tackle, you can only block the 1st 
or the 4th punch.  If that punch is a 1, block with 2 and vice versa. 

Back Tackle Left Punch Block        1
Back Tackle Right Punch Block       2

If you are tackled from behind, the person can only punch you.  However, you can 
escape the punches if you escape the 1st punch.  If that punch is a 1, block 
with 1 and vice versa.  The person will be thrown off of you for no damage.

Tackle Arm Lock Escape              1+2,2,2,2,2                        
Tackle Leg Lock Escape              1+2,1,1,1,1                         
Tackle Arm Lock Reversal            1+2,2,2,2,2,2                       
Tackle Leg Lock Reversal            1+2,1,1,1,1,1                       

You can avoid the punishment of a limb lock with the correct escapes/reversal.  
Everyone can escape limb locks.  However, only Paul, Jin, Nina, and King can 
reverse arm locks with arm locks of their own.  King and Nina can reverse leg 
locks.  Limb locks are hard to escape but are worth it to avoid large damage.

Left Reversal Escape (Chicken)      f+1+3                              
Right Reversal Escape (Chicken)     f+2+4                              

Added in Tekken 3 to stop abuse of the attack reversal, I can not emphasize the 
importance of attack reversal escapes.  This is also known as a "chicken" 
because the announcer actually says "chicken" during its execution.  If you 
throw a move that involves a left limb, use the left chicken and vice versa for 
the right.  If a move uses both arms or legs, the correct chicken (left/right) 
depends on the character and the move.  You have to enter the motion as soon as 
or just after you throw the move.  If your opponent attempts an attack reversal 
and you chicken, you escape the reversal and cause minimal damage to the 
opponent to boot.  The best way to do a chicken is to buffer it into a move you 
feel might get reversed.  For example, if I do King's Konvict Kick, but I feel 
it might get reversed, I would do the following: f,f+4~f+2+4.  If you want to 
buffer it, you can do f,f+[4]~f+2.  This is an example of button buffering.

Please note the very good news: King's kick reversals can not be chickened!!!  

Supercharger Powerup                ALL                     CH      

If you press all the buttons except tag, your hands will start to glow.  This is 
a supercharge powerup.  While you are supercharged, any hits cause an automatic 
counter hit.  It doesn't last long though.  I tend not to use it too much 
because of its obvious startup.  You can get hit during the startup.  

Netsu/Anger Powerup

This has no joystick motion or button press.  It is a powerup that your tag 
partner receives if your onscreen character is hit too many times.  When that 
happens, the lifebar of the offscreen character starts blinking red.  If that 
character is tagged in, his/her hits will do extra damage for a short time.  
Once the lifebar of the now onscreen character stops blinking, the powerup ends.  
Not all teams or characters experience a netsu powerup.  Some anger powerups 
require more hits than others depending on what team you are using.  By default, 
most teams allow 5 hits before the powerup is initiated.  If King is partnered 
with Armor King, only 4 hits are required for either of them to get a netsu 
powerup.  On that note, let's talk about moves that are specific to King II.

==========================
= King The Second Throws =
==========================

For the throws listed with a *** before them, the multiparts will be fully 
explained in the Multi section.  I just list them because they can be used as 
standalone throws if you don't know how to do the full multithrow sequences yet.

---------
- Front -
---------

Winding Nut                         1+3                     Left FT {1}  
Suplex                              2+4                     Right FT {2} FU/FA 
Tag Throw *!*                       2+5                     Tag FT {2}   

Your basic throws don't do much damage compared to command throws, but they are 
useful since they are quick.  The Winding Nut leaves you far away, but you can 
do a Stagger Kick.  The Suplex allows for a wake up foot sweep (FU/FA 3) on your 
opponent.  The tag throw allows your partner to tag in and damage the opponent. 

Muscle Buster                       QCB+1+2                 FT {1+2}

The Muscle Buster is the best command throw King has bar none (and probably the 
best overall throw in TTT IMHO).  It does huge damage and requires a double 
button press to escape.  You can follow with a Moonsault or a Blind Kick for 
okizeme.  The only bad thing about it is you sometimes get the Irish Whip or the 
Figure Four on bad joysticks.  This should be the #1 command throw of choice.

Giant Swing                         f,HCF+1                 FT {1_TR}

The Giant Swing is King's most damaging single throw.  It has huge reach since 
you hit forward twice during the motion.  If the character tech rolls, it does 
half damage, which is about the same damage as your basic throws.  It is also a 
single button escape.  However, the reach makes this thing scary when used.  Mix 
with the Tombstone Piledriver for a powerful throw mixup.

Tombstone Piledriver                db,f+2                  FT {2}

The Tombstone Piledriver is a powerful command throw, but the motion is more 
complex.  On some machines, it's hard to find the db position in a pinch.  Its 
only other weakness is the single button escape.  It does a even more damage 
like the Muscle Buster.  You can also perform ground throws afterwards since it 
leaves the opponent right next to you.  The ensuing ground throw(s) will almost 
kill them.  Mix this up with the Giant Swing to lessen the chance of escape.

Falling Headlock DDT                D,db,d,DB+1+2           FT {1+2}     

The Falling Headlock DDT is second in damage to the Giant Swing.  Essentially, 
it is a WC throw, but the motion is complex.  It is sometimes difficult to get 
this throw off, but the damage is worth it.  Its main use is to evade a high 
attack and counter grab from crouch.  The double button escape makes this move 
useful.  You can ground throw afterwards if you dash quickly.  

Frankensteiner                      df+3+4[~5]              FT {-} FD/FT [TJC4]

Even though the Frankensteiner is not escapable and does a butt load of damage, 
it only throws close standing opponents.  If you get the throw, you can tag out.  
If you don't throw, you will hit the opponent and end up FU/FT.  If you do throw 
you will be FD/FT unless you tag out.

Figure Four Leg Lock                DB+1+2                  FT {1+2_3+4}

I tend to avoid the Figure 4.  You can be reversed for damage by hitting 3+4 at 
the right time.  However, both the escape and the reversal are double button 
presses.  Since it is a simple command throw, it can be used with the same speed 
as a basic throw.  If the opponent doesn't know how to reverse it, then feel 
free to use it.  It doesn't do much damage, but you can Stagger Kick afterwards.

Knee Bash                           df+2+3                  FT {2}       

The Knee Bash does the least amount of damage of your command throws so I tend 
to avoid.  You can follow with a Stagger Kick afterwards.

Pile Driver ***                     QCF+1                   FT {1_3+4}   
Throw Away ***                      B+1+2                   FT {-}       

The Pile Driver and Throw Away are non-crouch dash multithrow starters, making 
them similar to normal throws.  If you enter an wrong button sequence, the throw 
ends with no follow up.  The Pile Driver can be escaped at the apex with 3+4. 
For the Throw Away, the throw has no escape, but the follow ups do.

Reverse Arm Slam ***                f,DF+1+3_f,DF+2+4       FT {1_2}     
Reverse Stretch Special Bomb ***    f,DF+1+2                FT {1+2}     

These two multithrow starters will cause King to crouch dash before he stands up 
and attempt to throw the opponent.  King will not start the crouch dash motion 
until the full command is entered, i.e., you have pressed the buttons.  This 
means you are basically committed to the throw and can not delay it.   

Standing Heel Hold ***              f,N,d,DF+2+3            FT {2}       
Arm Breaker ***                     f,N,d,DF+1+4            FT {1}       

These two multithrow starters allow King to crouch dash without committing to a 
throw.  Since King can do other moves from a crouch dash (Black Bomb, Hop Kick), 
King is not forced to throw unless he presses the buttons at the end.  

The follow ups for the multithrow starters are discussed in the Multi section.

-----------------
- Side/Sidestep -
-----------------

Argentine Backbreaker               1+3_2+4                 Left ST {1}  
Knee Crusher                        1+3_2+4                 Right ST {2} 

Both basic side throws cause good damage and can be followed up with ground 
throws.  If you throw from a sidestep, make sure you use SS 1+3.  Using SS 2+4 
will cause a sidestep multithrow rather than a standard side throw.  You can 
follow up either side throw with a Flying Elbow (uf+1+2) or ground throw.

Reverse Stretch Special Bomb ***    SS 2+4                  SSFT {1+2}     
= Cancel                            = B                     RC          
Cannonball Buster ***               SS 2+4                  ST {1_2}
= Cancel                            = B                     RC

You can grab opponents using a sidestep multithrow.  If you sidestep and end up 
grabbing them from the front, you will do the Reverse Stretch Special Bomb.  If 
you grab an opponent from the side or back, you will do the Cannonball Buster.  
To escape either sidestep multithrow, you escape as you would the crouch dash 
version for the Reverse Stretch Special Bomb or a standard side throw for the 
Cannonball Buster.  The back version of the Cannonball Buster is not escapable.  
You can cancel the initial grab by holding back before King stands up to grab.  
You can not side throw or sidestep multithrow a crouching opponent.

-----------------
- Crouching/Mid -
-----------------

Jumping Power Bomb                  d+1+3_d+2+4             MT {1+2}    

The Jumping Power Bomb does very good damage, but the range is suspect.  Then 
again, if my opponent is crouching at that range, I'll throw a hop kick before a 
crouch throw.  If you pull this off, feel free to ground throw the opponent.

Reverse Stretch Special Bomb ***    df,DF+2+4               MT {2} 

Unlike the standing variations of the RSSB, King does not crouch dash or 
sidestep - he does a crouching throw animation.  It has a little more distance 
than the Jumping Power Bomb due to the df motions, but I tend not to use crouch 
throws.  Near a crouching opponent, I'm usually thinking Hop Kick first.

Ultimate Tackle ***                 WC,1+2_f,N,d,DF+1+2     sMT {2_1+2}

The tackle can be your friend or enemy.  It can be done from WC or a crouch 
dash.  It has many follow ups.  Be careful of tackle reversals.  In that case, 
your opponent can damage you unless you know some tackle escapes.  Unlike other 
crouching throws, this will grab standing opponents as well.  The tackle is 
escaped with 2 and reversed with 1+2.  You can not tackle from the side.

---------------
- Back/Behind -
---------------

King has 3 back throws.  It doesn't matter which one you use; they all do huge 
damage.  Most back throws can not be escaped, but they can be crouched under.

Stretch Buster                      b,F+1+2                 BT {-}

The Stretch Buster is the most damaging of the three back throws and it allows 
for follow up ground throws especially on larger characters.  Make sure your 
opponent is facing backward or else you may end up doing a Jaguar Lariat.  The 
other two are very damaging and humiliating as well but don't have any real 
ground throw opportunities.  If you have the opportunity for a back throw, I 
usually go for the Stretch Buster, but any back throw will do.

Half Boston Crab                    1+3                     BT {-}      
Cobra Twist                         2+4_2+5                 BT {-}      

The Cobra Twist and the Half Boston Crab do equal damage.  It is simply a matter 
of preference on which one you use.  Neither allow for any ground throws, but 
you can perform a Stagger Kick afterwards IIRC.

Cannonball Buster ***               SS 2+4                  BT {-}      
= Cancel                            = B                     RC          

If you do a sidestep multithrow and grab the opponent from behind, this is what 
you end up with.  As with all back throws, this is NOT escapable, but the 
follows ups are.

Ultimate Tackle ***                 WC,1+2_f,N,d,DF+1+2     sMBT {-}

You can tackle opponents from front or behind but not from the side.  From 
behind, the tackle is not escapable, but the follow up punches are.

Reverse Throw                       BK 1+3_BK 2+4           BKT {1_2_-}

If you are facing away from your opponent, you can still perform a throw.  Your 
character will turn around and do a throw.  The escapes are the same as well.

----------
- Ground -
----------

All ground throws have the same command - db+1+3_db+2+4.  However, this can be 
hard to do in the heat of battle.  I suggest that you hold 1 or 2 during a move 
stun so that you don't throw a punch.  Then while holding down the punch, you 
press db and the appropriate kick.  Since you have already held down the 
corresponding punch, you will attempt a ground throw - welcome to Tekken Button 
Buffering 101.  Simply do this: [1],db+3 or [2],db+4.  It makes ground throwing 
a lot easier for me.  You can also hold the kick first and then punch instead.

You usually have to dash in for a ground throw after a set up move.  Buffer the 
dash or run from your move stun so you  get to the opponent quickly.  If you do 
it right, the opponent can not get up; they will be forced to escape the throw.

Head Bomber                         db+2+4                  FU/FT GT {2}

The Head Bomber is the cooling looking ground throw that King has - you will get 
huge cool points from the audience (and cringes from the men and/or your 
opponent) if you pull this off.  King lifts the opponent's legs by the ankles 
and headbutts them in the crotch.  After this ground throw, you can Stagger 
Kick.  This is probably the ground throw you will be using the most (it's the 
one I use the most) since it tends to humiliate the best and just hurts a lot.

Figure Four Leg Lock                DB+2+4                  FU/FT GT {1+2)

I almost never the Figure Four ground throw since I prefer the Head Bomber.  
Unlike the standing Figure 4, you can not reverse the ground the Figure 4.  On 
larger characters, you may actually be able to do two figure-four leg locks.  
Perform the standing one (DB+1+2) and then quickly dash and do the ground one.  
It is actually very hard but not impossible.  If you find your opponent escaping 
the Head Bomber, use this since it has a double button escape.

Swing Away                          db+1+3                  FU/FT GT {1}

I tend not to use the Swing Away since it doesn't look like you can follow it up 
very well.  King throws you pretty far away.  However, if you prefer using 1+3 
for your ground throws, this is the one for you.  King picks up the opponent by 
the legs and does a single rotation of his Giant Swing before letting go.

FU/FT ground throws can be performed after the following moves:

Knee Crusher                        1+3_2+4                 Right ST {2}
Leg Screw                           b+1+3_b+2+4             M_H 4

Half Boston Crab                    db+1+3_db+2+4           FD/FT GT {3+4}

This is King's only FD/FT ground throw.  He grabs a leg and pulls up and back on 
it until the hip cracks (like the 1+3 back throw).  You need very good timing to 
get the FD/FT ground throw off the Throw Away setup since you have to dash very 
far in a very short time (PRACTICE).  It also has an unusual escape {3+4}.

The following moves set up FD/FT ground throws:

Throw Away ***                      B+1+2                   FT {-}
= Throw Away Knockdown              = ~2+4                  {2}

Shoulder Cracker                    db+1+3_db+2+4           FU/FA GT {1+2}

This is King's only FU/FA ground throw.  King grabs one arm, places it between 
his legs, and cracks the shoulder, similar to the Struggle Combination finish 
from the Arm Breaker.  All of the setup moves leave your opponent right next to 
you.  Perform the ground throw as soon as your move stun ends.

The following moves set up FU/FA ground throws:

Tombstone Piledriver                db,f+2                  FT {2}
Arm Breaker ***                     f,N,d,DF+1+4            FT {1}

Wing Tearer                         db+1+3_db+2+4           FD/FA GT {1+2}

For a FD/FA opponent, this is King's only ground throw.  The Wing Tearer is 
King's second most painful ground throw.  King grabs the opponent by the wrists 
and puts his knee on their back - he then pulls the wrists towards him like 
levers until the shoulders crack (OUCH!).  However, the setups aren't the most 
reliable as all of them require counters.  The Elbow Sting leaves your opponent 
FD/FA on CH, but your opponent can get up easily.  The Stomach Smash CH and 
Blind Kick CH are better, but the timing is very precise.

The following moves leave your opponent FD/FA:

Stomach Smash                       f,f,N+2                 LG DSc      
Elbow Sting                         df+1                    M GB KS

Flip Over                           db+1+3_db+2+4           Left FU/S GT {1}
Flip Over                           db+1+3_db+2+4           Right FU/S GT {2}

King doesn't have any ground throws that damage FU/S opponents.  For the Flip 
Over, it is sometimes necessary to dash beforehand, especially after the 
Argentine Backbreaker.  After the Flip Over, repeat the motion (dash if need be) 
and you'll get the FD/S ground throw, which will do damage.  After the Flip Over 
on larger characters, you can do the ground throw motion without a dash.  The 
escape follows the same protocol as side throws.

The following moves set up FU/S ground throws:

Argentine Backbreaker               1+3_2+4                 Left ST {1}
Double Heel Hold                    b+1+3_b+2+4             M_H 3
Shoulder Cracker                    db+1+3_db+2+4           FU/FA GT {1+2}

Camel Clutch                        db+1+3_db+2+4           Left FD/S GT {1}  
Bow & Arrow Stretch Hold            db+1+3_db+2+4           Right FD/S GT {2}  

The commands for the Camel Clutch and the Bow and Arrow Stretch are the same; 
the throw performed depends on what side of the opponent you are on.  Simply do 
either setup ground throw, dash if necessary, and then perform the next ground 
throw.  The escapes are similar to standing side throws.

Button buffering can be done for the following links to make it easier to get 
these throws off in the heat of battle:

Back Drop: 2,1,1+2 => 2,[1],2
Cannonball Buster: 2,2,1+2 => 2,[2],1
Manhattan Drop: 3+4,1+2,1+2+4 => 3+4,[1+2],4
Muscle Buster: 3,1,2,3+4,ALL => 3,1,2,[3+4],1+2

You can get 3-6 throws with this series.  To get 6, you start with the Reverse 
Arm Slam and then branch to the Cannonball Buster.  The only way to get 3 is to 
start with the Cannonball Buster and chain into the Power Bomb.

You can enter multiple follow up throws during throw intervals.  This is known 
as multithrow bluffing (thanks to the person in the Tekken Zaibatsu forum who 
coined the term).  In case someone looks at your hands to see what throw you are 
doing next, you can do multiple follow ups to a throw to confuse the opponent.  

Let's use the Reverse Stretch Special Bomb to Cannonball Buster throw as an 
example.  After these two throws, you can do the Power Bomb or the Manhattan 
Drop, both of which can be escaped with 1 and 2 respectively.  If you are only 
entering one throw after the Cannonball Buster and the opponent can see what 
throw you are doing, they may know the escape.  However, if you do both entries, 
the opponent will be forced to guess.  It looks like this:

f,DF+1+2, 2,2,1+2, 1,2,3+4,3+4,1+2,1+2+4

Note the consecutive 3+4's?  You can actually take one out and still perform 
the bluff.  It would like this:

f,DF+1+2, 2,2,1+2, 1,2,3+4,1+2,1+2+4...

In the second case, you are buffering throw commands into one another.  I call 
This multithrow buffering (not to be confused with button buffering).  The 
buffering in this case also helps to multithrow bluff.

In general, you can bluff anytime you can enter more than one throw.  You can 
multithrow buffer when any two sequences have a matching begin-end button press 
(3+4 in this case).  In fact, multithrow buffering makes multithrow bluffing 
easier since it reduces the number of button presses needed for multiple follow-
ups.  If this sounds confusing, don't worry - I will show more examples with 
other multithrows as well.  

True multithrow bluffing can also be done by intentionally missing a button 
press to fool an opponent into thinking you're doing a certain multithrow only 
do another sequence correctly.  In the example, if you mess up the Power Bomb's 
1 or the Manhattan Drop's 1+2+4, you will only do the properly entered throw.

There are several throws whose escape is dependent on what throw you chained 
from or what buttons you used to grab.  Here is an escape chart:

Reverse           Back              German            Power             Giant

Special Bomb ***  Buster ***        Drop              Bomb              Buster

Here are the "conditional" multi throw escapes:

Reverse Arm Slam: Left {1} ; Right {2}

Reverse Stretch Special Bomb: Crouching {2} ; Crouch Dash or Sidestep {1+2} 

Back Drop: After Left Reverse Arm Slam {1} ; After Right Reverse Arm Slam {2}

Cannonball Buster: Left Side {1} ; Right Side or After Back Drop {2} ; Back or 
After Reverse Stretch Special Bomb {-}

Power Bomb: After Cannonball Buster {1} ; After German Suplex {-}

Giant Swing: After Power Bomb {1} ; After Victory Bomb {2}

Muscle Buster: After Victory Bomb {1} ; After Power Bomb {2}

The following throws always have the same escape:

German Suplex: After Back Drop {1}
Manhattan Drop: After Cannonball Buster {2}
Victory Bomb: After Manhattan Drop {-}

  = King's Bridge                     = 1,3,4,1+2,3+4       {-}

For the Standing Heel Hold series, if the opponent escapes the Scorpion 
Deathlock, Indian Death Lock or the S.T.F., King will receive 10 damage.  

You can button buffer the Scorpion Deathlock from the Standing Heel Hold:

f,N,d,DF+2+3, 1+2,3,[1],3

Since the Standing Heel Hold animation is quite long, you can actually input all 
three follow ups through multithrow bluffing and buffering:

f,N,d,DF+2+3, 1,2,3,1+2,1,3,1+2,3,1,1+3

If you look closely, I have entered the STF, Indian Death Lock, and the Scorpion 
Deathlock.  Entering all the throws can prevent a possible escape.  This is easy 
to do because you have a ton of time to enter all the links.  Even still, it 
also depends on whether or not you have the links down to a science (PRACTICE).

  = Rolling Death Cradle              = 1+3,3+4,2+4,1+2,1+2+3 {2}

You can buffer button presses during these chain throws:

Head Jammer: 1+2,[4],2
Chicken Wing Face Lock: 2,[1],2+3 (or alternatively [2,1],3 or [2],[1],3)
Rolling Death Cradle: 1+3,3+4,2+4,[1+2],3

Ironically, I can not do the Struggle Combination with button buffering even 
though it looks like a good candidate.  I have tried to do it but no success.

Even though the Chicken Wing Face Lock sequence is 2,1,1+2+3, you can hold 2, 
then hold 1 while holding 2, and press 3 while holding both 1 and 2.  Even 
though you are really doing 2,1+2,1+2+3, it still works - go fig.

Since you do not get much time to enter a followup sequence, you can usually 
only enter two out of three follow-ups.  If you're really quick and nimble, try 
entering this from the Arm Breaker:

f,N,d,DF+1+4, 2,1,1+2+3,1+2,1+2,4,2+4

If you take out the Chicken Wing button presses, you can do the Triple Arm 
Breaker and Head Jammer very quickly.

If you can do the Rolling Death Cradle reliably, you are the BOMB DIGGY!  I 
still have trouble doing it.  However, it is very possible.  Here is how I do it 
(thanks to another Tekken Zaibatsu forum member on how to do it):

1+3: Use your index finger and thumb
3+4: Use your index and middle fingers
2+4: Use your index and thumb
1+2: Use your index and middle fingers but hold them down
1+2+3: Use your thumb for 3 while holding 1+2

It does the most damage in the game for a multithrow, but the button sequence is 
by far the most annoying of them all.  It is also a simple button escape {2}.

I personally tend to finish the Arm Breaker series with the Struggle Combination 
or the Dragon Sleeper.  If you get the Head Jammer off, the Struggle Combination 
is inescapable.  However, I can't seem to follow it with a ground throw – just 
Stagger Kick afterwards.  However, you can follow the Dragon Sleeper Finish with 
a ground throw.  I almost never do the Triple Arm Breaker.

    = Stretch Combo                     = 1+2               {-}         

You can buffer a Cross Arm Lock from the Ultimate Punches: 

f,N,d,DF+1+2_WC,1+2, 1,2,[1],2
f,N,d,DF+1+2_WC,1+2, 2,1,[2],1.

To escape the punches from the tackle, you have to put in the escape for the 1st 
or 4th punch.  If that punch is a 1, escape with 2 and vice versa for 2.

To get the Stretch Combo, you have to hit 1+2 exactly when King's back hits the 
ground from the Leg Cross Hold.  The Arm Twist doesn't have this precise timing, 
making it much easier to finish with.  You can do either lock from the first set 
of ultimate punches.  The Leg Cross Hold into the Stretch Combo does a lot more 
damage so it is worth going for if you can get the timing and you really need 
the damage.  If the opponent is close to dying, just go with the Arm Twist.

  Ultimate Punches                    1,2,1,2,1_2,1,2,1,2   {1_2}       

You can tackle someone from behind.  However, you can only do punches.  Even 
though the initial tackle is not escapable, the punches are.  Only the 1st punch 
can be escaped.  If that punch is a 1, escape with 1 and vice versa for 2.  The 
escape for the punches is actually switched because the victim is turned over.

= Tag w/ Armor King *!*             = ~5                    {2}

Unlike other multithrows, you have to enter the next command after the 
Throw Away quickly or else you'll just spin the opponent around.

The Throw and Destroy and the Throw Away Knockdown set up ground throws.  As 
with all ground throws, you have to be quick and usually dash to set it up.

The Throw Away Feint and the Turn Around do no damage and leave the opponent 
standing.  The Turn Around does leave your opponent BK albeit far away.  Neither 
of them have any guaranteed follow ups AFAIK.

If King is partnered with Armor King, King can tag from the Throw Away.  The 
opponent is thrown towards Armor King where he will power slam the opponent.

= Boston Crab                       = <1+2,3,4,1+2          {-}         

The Double Arm Face Buster can only be done at the very beginning of the Pile 
Driver.  The Boston Crab has to be entered at the apex.  Since they share a 
common 1+2, make sure you time your button presses appropriately.  I personally 
do the Boston Crab since it does more damage.  If you do the Double Arm Face 
Buster, you only get damage for one throw.  With the Boston Crab, King slams the 
opponent down first and then go for the Boston Crab, which in turn does more 
damage.  At the apex of the Pile Driver, an opponent can escape with 3+4.

Even though I don't personally buffer this throw, you can doing the following:

QCF+[1]~2
QCF+[1]<2,3,4,1+2

This is the only multithrow chain that doesn't begin with a throw.  It starts 
with a counterhit Stomach Smash.  If you stun, go for the Jaguar Driver.  It 
does  more damage and looks cooler. :) Both can be followed by ground throws.  

Once again buffering can be done even though you don't really need to:

f,f,N+[2],1
f,f,N+[2],1,u,d,N+3+4

= King the Second Reversals =
=============================

King has been blessed with kick reversals.  In fact, you can NOT chicken out of 
them.  Then again he can't reverse punches - you can't win them all.

Leg Screw                           b+1+3_b+2+4             M_H 4      

The Leg Screw right kick reversal throws your opponent away from you, but you 
can perform FU/FT ground throws if you buffer a dash.

Double Heel Hold                    b+1+3_b+2+4             M_H 3     

The Double Heel Hold left kick reversal keeps your opponent close to you so you 
can do the FU/S ground throws into the FD/S ground throws.

Low Thrust Block/Parry              d+1+4_d+2+3_D+2+3_D+1+4 L           

The low parry is good against any low attacks.  If you stop a move with this, 
you can usually Konvict Kick (f,f+4) or Hop Kick (u/f+4) before the opponent can 
stand up and recover.  If you Hop Kick the opponent, any standard juggle should 
work.  It stuns an enemy longer than the df universal low parry.

Low Jab Uppercut                    d+1~N+2_D+1~N+2         sMM         

The Low Jab Uppercut is your best attack bar none and one of the best in TTT.  
It is useful for getting inside since it moves King forward.  It has little 
recovery unless it whiffed and it is not very easy to reverse.  Since you start 
with a low jab, you can travel under high attacks quickly and counter with this.  
You don't have much recovery after the uppercut.  In fact, this move is even 
better than the standing Jab Uppercut due to its range and the slower recovery 
of the Jab Uppercut in TTT.  Abuse this move, but be ready to chicken reversals.

Jab Uppercut                        2,1                     HM          

This is another punch string that can be useful.  Granted it is not his best 
punch chain anymore, it has set up potential.  The 1 in this case is an uppercut 
which hits mid so opponents can not crouch this punch chain.  It makes for a 
good poking tool and as well as a relatively quick counter to any move finishing 
high.  Unfortunately, you can no longer follow this string with anything for 
free as you could in Tekken 3.  However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.  
This string was weakened in terms of recovery, but it still recovers quickly.

One note of warning though - DO NOT hold forward while doing the 2 on the ground 
of in combo.  If you do, you will start F+2 9-hit string version of this where 
the uppercut has much longer recovery.  Instead, do a f,N,2,1 if you want to 
increase its range.  This move is also a key part of his juggling strategy since 
the uppercut causes a mini-rejuggle so to speak.  As with most punch chains, be 
prepared to chicken in case of reversal. 

Palm Attack To Attack               1,2,1                   HHM

Even though it is not as good as the Low Jab Uppercut or the Jab Uppercut in 
terms of use, the Palm Attack to Attack is another punch rush that can be used 
often.  It starts up a little faster than the Jab Uppercut since it starts with 
1 rather than 2.  Unlike the Jab Uppercut, you can hold forward or even dash to 
give the initial 1 more distance.  It also ends with the uppercut, but I am not 
sure if the recovery is the same as the Jab Uppercut.  Since the first two hits 
are high, you may get countered before you get to the uppercut, the second 1.  
If you need a quick counter or poke, you can also use this move, but I tend to 
prefer the Low Jab Uppercut chain in general.  You can also do the Palm Attack 
without the To Attack uppercut as a generic 1,2 punch string for poking.  The 
Low Jab Uppercut, Jab Uppercut, and the Palm Attack To Attack have good 
recovery.  As with the (Low) Jab Uppercut, you may need to chicken reversals.

Leg Breaker                         WC,df+1                 LG JG          

The Leg Breaker is a slow but annoying move that hits low.  It is a damaging low 
juggle starter.  It is best done from far away because it is easy to counter 
close up.  If your opponent is turtling, doing this move from far away 
will sometimes surprise them.  If you do hit the opponent with this, you can 
usually follow up with another Leg Breaker by holding DF and pressing 1 again.   
You can combo two in a row, but the opponent can roll to its right and escape 
after the second one.  You can also do other combos off the Leg Breaker, but 
another Leg Breaker is probably the simplest one.  You can also perform FU/FA 
ground throws after the Leg Breaker but you have to be very quick.

Inside Uppercut                     WS+1                    M           

Even though this is a basic move, it is useful inside.  It is quick with little 
recovery and has a lot or priority.  However, it doesn't knock down or juggle.  
I sometimes get this move trying to do something else.  Its only weakness is its 
lack of range.  However, its priority makes up for that.

Crouching Uppercut                  WC,df+2[~5]             M JG [TJC2]       
K's Flicker                         f,f+2[~5]               M KD JGch [TJC2ch_5]       
While Standing Uppercut             WS+2                    M KD          

Even though these three uppercuts look exactly the same on execution, they do 
have subtle differences.  The Crouching Uppercut will always juggle and is a tag 
juggle starter.  K's Flicker only juggles on counter hit but will tag on a 
normal hit.  If you tag on a normal Flicker hit, there is no real guaranteed 
followup.  The WS+2 Uppercut doesn't juggle and you can't tag from it.  If you 
block a low move with poor recovery, quickly go to df+2 to start a juggle or 
WS+2 for some easy damage and a knockdown.  Note that all three uppercuts have a 
very significant recovery.  They all do pretty good damage though.

Stomach Smash                       f,f,N+2                 LG DSch      
= Hi-Jack BackBreaker               = 1+2                   {1+2}       
= Jaguar Driver                     = 1+2,u,d,N+3+4         {3+4}       

King goes a long distance as he bends down and punches very low to the ground. I 
tend not to use the Stomach Smash much, but it has its uses.  It hits low and 
grounded opponents.  However, the f,f,N sometimes makes hard to use up close.  
Hence I tend to only use this from far away so I don't get hit out of it before 
I do the move.  This is another move to use against turtlers who stand a 
distance away.  Its other redeeming factor is the ability to multithrow on CH.   
However, King has easier and more useful multithrow starters.  You can also 
start juggle combos from it on CH, but the double-over stun can be escaped.

Elbow Sting                         df+1                    M GB KDch KScr 
< Side Swipe *!*                    < 2                     M 

The Elbow Sting is probably his best non-jab single punch attack.  It comes out 
very fast and causes a stun or guard break on impact.  On crouching opponents, 
it causes a knee down stun (KS).  It knocks down FD/FA on CH.  Do not ground 
throw since the opponent can get up easily.  I usually Stagger Kick instead for 
extra damage.  This is not as dominating as Paul's Elbow, but it is still a very 
high priority move.  As with most punch attacks, be wary of reversals.  The 
Elbow Sting can be interrupted by fast jabs at close range.

You can follow the Elbow Sting with a Side Swipe.  A Side Swipe will miss on a 
Elbow Sting CH.  This is another punch rush that can close distance.

Side Swipe                          df+2                    M           

The Side Swipe has a small range, can't be reversed, hits mid, and has little 
recovery.  It is also juggle filler since it will cause a small rejuggle.

Head Spinner                        1+2                     M BK
< Knifehand                         < 1                     M KD         

The Head Spinner - Knifehand (referred to as the Head Spinner combo) is his best 
long range punch move.  King does a spinning elbow into a knife edge chop.  It 
covers a large distance quickly and does loads of damage.  It is usually hard to 
see coming and the first part isn't reversible.  The spinning elbow will avoid 
most jabs during execution.  The knife hand is reversible so left chicken if the 
1+2 is blocked.  If the chop is blocked, it is not easy to retaliate.  The chop 
can be delayed or left out altogether; that will leave King in a BK position.  
This move can also be done out of a sidestep quickly and easily.  Use this move 
as a counter when you think your opponent is doing an attack reversal.  Since 
the elbow isn't reversible, they end up eating the Head Spinner for counter 
damage.  It is also a good juggle finisher and a very good move in general.

Knockout Punch                      SS 2                    H KD FSch      

The Knockout Punch is a move I hardly ever use.  Even though it comes from a 
sidestep, it is extremely slow and hits high.  It does do a lot of damage 
though.  If it does hit, it either causes a violent knockdown on a fall-over 
stun on CH.  If you do not CH and the opponent doesn't tech roll (~b), you can 
dash and get a FU/FT ground throw, but you have to be very quick about it.  If 
you counter hit, you can juggle off of the stun even though it is escapable.  
You can also ground throw on CH, but the CH stun can be escaped.  

Flying Cross Chop                   f,f,N+1+2               sM_H~LG KD

The Flying Cross Chop is similar to the wake-up version of the Flying Cross Chop 
that can be done from a knockdown or tag, but it is done from a standing 
position.  It seems to hit special mid in TTT.  In Tekken 3, it hit high 
initially then came down to hit low and grounded opponents.  Since King jumps 
up, this move avoids a lot of attacks.  Its only weakness is the little damage 
that it does.  It is also not reversible and tends to interrupt other attacks.
       
Black Bomb                          f,N,d,df,N+1+2[~5]      M KD BNch [TJC2ch_4]

Since the Black Bomb is a crouch dash move, it is useful in King's crouch dash 
strategy.  What King essentially does is a crouch dash into a downward double 
axehandle.  Since four of his multithrows begin with a crouch dash, this move is 
useful in case your opponent crouches expecting a multithrow.  You can hit them 
with this for very good damage.  If you counter hit the opponent, you will cause 
a bounce juggle, which bounces your opponent off the ground.  If you hit with 
the move, you can tag out, but it only tag juggles on CH.

Capital Punishment                  uf+1+2                  M CFS?          

King performs a jumping axehandle similar to the Black Bomb.  It has far range 
since he jumps before doing it.  Using it up close can be bad since the opponent 
can hit you out of your jump and juggle you.  This move hits mid and semi-
grounded opponents trying to get up but does not hit fully grounded opponents.  
You can punish mistakes from long range with this move.  It is good for catching 
incoming (as in tagging in) characters.  I believe this move is reversible as is 
the Black Bomb.  If you hit with this move, it causes a (crumple fall?) stun 
that can be followed up with Stagger Kicks for an easy juggle.

Shoulder Tackle                     f+2+3                   M           

The shoulder tackle is good because it has unusual priority.  It does have a 
little bit of startup so it is best used from medium distance.  Once started, it 
does much damage, but the recovery isn't too hot unless you use it from far away 
so use with caution.  It can be used in okizeme to hit semi-grounded opponents 
and can be used to punish incoming opponents or as a tag move when King tags in.

Elbow Drop                          d+1+2                   MG FU/FA         

This move can be used on hard hit grounded opponents, i.e., after a Jaguar 
Lariat.  It is similar to the Rock's "People's Elbow" from the WWF (thanks to 
Domingo's Armor King FAQ on that description).  It hits standing and grounded 
opponents.  I sometimes use this to avoid damage when tagging in since King is 
left on the ground after move.  If you do it while someone is standing, chances 
are you may actually hit whatever they were trying to do since the elbow is the 
closest thing to the opponent.  This leaves you FU/FA so be ready for okizeme.

High Elbow Drop                     U+2+4_UF+2+4            MG          

This move is a jumping elbow drop.  It can be used to avoid attacks especially 
when tagging in or to pounce on opponents.  However, with tech get up, this move 
is no longer the beast it was in Tekken 2 (the U+2 elbow pounce).  It does do a 
lot of damage but isn't very useful except to avoid certain unblockables.  You 
can also use it after either side throw as a powerful two-hit combo. 

Diving Body Splash *!*              f,F+2+3                 MG          

Like the Shoulder Tackle, this move comes out slowly, but it does good damage.  
It can be used as a pounce or for okizeme.  If it is blocked, it stuns but 
leaves you FD/S to your opponent so expect some okizeme punishment if missed or 
blocked.  It can be used to counter Kuma's Hunting Bear stance and Ling's Art of 
Pheonix stance.  It is best used as a surprise move.

Layoff                              f,f+1+2                 H

This move does no damage by itself, but it can be followed up if you are quick.  
In Tekken 3, you could follow this up with a Disgraceful Kick, but I don't think 
you can in TTT.  King will push you, which will break your guard, allowing for a 
fast attack to penetrate.  You can only use it up close like a throw.

Stagger Kick                        WC,df+4_WC,df+3+4_d+3+4 LG

  = Stagger Kicks                     = ~4,4                LG,LG CH    

Learn to love the Stagger Kick (Ali Kick) - you will be using a lot.  It hits 
low, can be repeated, has many follow ups, and hits grounded opponents.  On CH,  
you can hit with multiple Stagger Kicks or go into a Spinning Uppercut.  If you 
have a Stagger Kick or Spinning Uppercut blocked, you will be asking for a 
beating as both have lousy recovery.  People tend to call this move cheap, but 
it does have enough shortcomings that it can be beaten pretty easily by smart 
players.  Do not be afraid to use this move especially for okizeme.  To be safe, 
if you're not sure this is going to hit a standing opponent, only throw one as 
the recovery isn't too good.  Most players will be expecting 2 or 3 so you will 
probably escape unscathed even if it is blocked.  A single Stagger Kick can be 
used to counter Paul's Death Fist due to its length.

Hop Kick                            uf+4                    M JG        

The Hop Kick is your quickest juggle starter.  If you need a quick juggle or 
counter, use this.  In Tekken 3, you could Hop Kick after a low parry, but I'm 
not sure if this is the case in TTT.  It has good range and speed.  Its recovery 
is small but enough to be punished if you're not careful.  The majority of your 
juggles will come from this move.  As with most other kicks, this can be 
reversed if you get too predictable with it.  You can also use the Hop Kick out 
of a crouch dash (f,N,d,df,(f),uf+4).  This is another way to mix up the crouch 
dash in your King routine.  This move is most useful in countering any blocked 
high recovery move that leaves you standing.

Konvict Kick                        f,f+4                   M           

The dash motion on the Konvict Kick gives it very good range.  It is simply a 
mid hitting front kick that knocks down and hits hard.  On CH, it does massive 
damage.  This is also good for okizeme countering and punishment - second to the 
Disgraceful Kick.  Since it hits mid, you can punish crouching moves nicely.  It 
does have some recovery so don't overuse it.  You can also do this move out of a 
crouch dash (f,N,d,df,f, f+4).

Front Kick                          WS+4                    M           

The Front Kick is probably the safest and most powerful of the WS moves.  It has 
good range, hits mid, and has good recovery.  You can also do the modified 
version of it (m-WS+4) as explained in the While Standing section. The only 
quirk of the m-WS+4 is that sometimes King will go slightly off axis during the 
kick.  Out of the m-WS moves, the m-WS+4 is definitely the most useful one.  
This can be done out of a crouch dash (f,N,d,df, f+4).  This move is useful 
in custom stringing since it reaches far and is quick.

Disgraceful Kick                    b+4                     H           

This move looks like it hits mid, but it hits high.  However, don't let that 
stop you from using it.  It is his best okizeme move for missed rising attacks 
(3_4).  If either of these are missed, simply do this move (or the Konvict 
Kick, but this is faster) to knock them back down and start the fun all over 
again.  If you hit the opponent at close range, it causes a hard knockdown 
(extra damage).  In that scenario, you can Moonsault or Blind Kick, but it's not 
always a guaranteed hit if the opponent knows what he/she is doing.  If you 
counter hit from midrange, you get a rollback knockdown where you have to run to 
chase down the enemy.  It can also be used to finish juggles for decent damage.  
You can counter Nina/Anna's double palm attack (Blonde Bomb/Scarlet Bomb) with 
this if you buffer it out of your block stun.

Rib Buster                          df+3                    M           

Even though this is technically a basic move, this move is one of King's best 
kicks.  It is a long reaching left footed round kick that hits mid.  It has good 
reach and does good damage.  If someone is evading to your left, use this to 
snuff them clean.  This move is also very good after a Jab Uppercut rush, but it 
doesn't combo like it did in Tekken 3. I tend to use it towards its maximum 
range to avoid having it snuffed up close - it does have a slightly slow 
startup.  This move screams "abuse me" - an overall great move.  As with most 
moves, be wary of reversals – chicken when necessary.  

Knee Buster                         df+4                    L           

This move is highly underrated.  King does a standing low kick that is similar 
to his Rib Buster.  It has short yet deceptive range.  It can be used in a 
mid/low mix-up with the Rib Buster to annoy and pressure the opponent.  Since it 
hits low, it can only be low parried.  However, I have never seen anyone do that 
on reaction.  This should be another move in your King ground arsenal especially 
up close.  Since it is a low move, it helps against turtlers up close.

Frankensteiner                      df+3+4[~5]              sMG FU/FT  

If you don't throw with the Frankensteiner, King will flip and land FU/FT. The 
flip hits special mid.  It's a good move to use on a grounded opponent.  If you 
don't throw with this move, it doesn't do much damage.  

Exploder                            f,f+3+4                 M GB KD FU/FT     
Delayed Exploder                    3+4                     M GB KD FU/FT     

King does a drop kick and ends up FU/FT.  If you press both kicks, King will 
take a step and then drop kick.  This is the delayed version.  If you dash 
first, he will drop kick as soon as you press 3+4.  It does moderate damage.   
Before you hit the apex, you can be hit out of the air so be careful.   

Running Exploder                    WR 3+4                  H GB KD FU/FT 

King does a spinning drop kick and ends up FU/FT.  It hits high but does a lot 
more damage than the Exploder.  On CH, this does almost as much damage as the 
Deadly Boomerang.  It works well to catch your opponent when tagging in or out. 
           
Deadly Boomerang                    SS 3+4                  H GB KD FD/S       

King does a sidestep into a jumping round kick landing FD/S.  This is the Deadly 
Boomerang.  It looks like a Back Brain Kick - I like to call it the Head Hunter 
Kick or the Ghetto Blaster. :) On CH, this is deadly and can end rounds quickly 
if you know how to use it.  I have killed people with two moves (Giant Swing & 
Deadly Boomerang), which is reminiscent of Jack-2 in Tekken 2 - CH megaton punch 
& big splash, but I digress.  Don't try to reverse this kick - it is not worth 
it.  Someone tried to do it but could not - after 2 hits the round was over.  If 
this can be reversed, I would like to see it.  King ends up on the ground FD/S.  
Even though King does the move off of a sidestep, he does a second SS (SSL?) 
before he does the kick.

Rolling Sobat *!*                   f+4                     M SHch          

King turns around and does a spinning jump kick.  The Rolling Sobat has a long 
range - about as long as the Disgraceful Kick.  It hits mid, but I have missed 
some crouching opponents with this move when it looked like it should have hit.  
It is one of his longest pokes. It is fast for such a long range move.  This 
kick almost screams "abuse me" but be wary of reversals.  Up close, a d+1 may 
interrupt it before it comes out and cause a low juggle since King leaves the 
ground.  It is best used from midrange to avoid getting countered/interrupted.  

Blind Kick *!*                      BK 3                    MG GB CSc   

King does a mule kick while his back is turned.  It hits mid and causes guard 
stun.  It is best used on semigrounded opponents after a close Disgraceful Kick 
or Muscle Buster.  You can juggle or ground throw on CH.  

-----------------------
- Unblockable Attacks -
-----------------------

Jaguar Lariat                       F+1+2                   UH KD          

The Jaguar Lariat can be used as a surprise move.  It is a high unblockable, 
but there is no flash before he attacks.  He just sidesteps slightly and 
lariats.  This does huge damage and allows for an Elbow Drop or a ground throw.

Atomic Blaster                      BK 1+2                  UH KD         

The Atomic Blaster is the backed turned version of the Jaguar Lariat.  Like the 
Jaguar Lariat, it is a high unblockable that has no warning flash.  He turns 
around and clotheslines you.  They do about the same damage.  I do not think you 
can follow up this move since King is to the side of the opponent facing away.

Moonsault                           1+4_f+1+4_BK 1+4        UG KD FD/FT

The Moonsault is his best unblockable.  It hits opponents in every position.  
King turns around, jumps in the air, and flips face down on his opponent.  It 
does decent damage and has excellent follow ups.  If you hit the opponent, you 
can roll off and throw a wake-up 3 and nail the opponent while they're trying to 
get up.  From there, you can go into a Stagger Kick, Spinning Uppercut combo and 
attempt another Moonsault.  This is also useful on standing opponents as a 
surprise attack from medium distance.  Many an opponent has come in attacking 
from too far away only to have King drop on them for good free damage.  You can 
be hit out of it if you get too predictable or if you are too close to your 
opponent when you start the move. If it misses, you land on the ground FD/FT and 
can receive okizeme punishment there.  I tend to use the above Moonsault trap 
(f+1+4, wake-up CH 3,d+3+4~2 repeat as they get up) on opponents who don't know 
how to counter or escape it. One last note: it is usually better to use f+1+4 to 
do the Moonsault unless you are turned around.  The f motion will align yourself 
towards your opponent in case your opponent sidesteps or rolls to the side.

It is imperative that you learn other characters' hit strings as well as your 
own so you can counter or reverse them before you misblock and eat half the 
string.  In fact, if you ever play another King, you will be ready in case 
the other King decided to test your 10-hit string skills.  Here are some 
important notes and observations in King's 10-hit strings.

Hits 4, 6, and 9 are break points, i.e., you can always block or even counter or 
reverse those hits even if you got hit by the previous attack.  They are noted 
with asterisks around the numbers in the chart.

Hits 1 and 2 are always high punches.

The first medium hit, Hit 3, is always an Uppercut (the same one as the "Jab 
Uppercut" and "Palm Attack to Attack" Uppercut).  Opponents can no longer crouch 
at this point.  The uppercut can only be followed by an Elbow Sting at Hit 4.  
Both hits are mid. 

Hit 5 is always high.  Even though you can have an Elbow Swipe as the 5th hit, 
it will be considered high (or mabye even sM?) even though by itself it is 
normally mid.  This is important because you can actually block low in 
preparation for the Stagger Kick or prepare a counter.  Your other option for 
Hit 5 is a high spin kick (WS+3).

If you choose to take the kick route for Hits 5 & 6 (Spin Kick => Jump Kick), 
please note that both are easily reversible if the opponent blocks the elbow 
before the kick.  I have reversed other King players who have tried this on me.

If you hit with the Stagger Kick in Hit 6 from the Elbow Swipe or in Hit 7 from 
the Jump Kick (i.e., the first Stagger Kick in the hit string), you cause a very 
large stun.  You should be able to get off a WS move, tackle, or throw.  I 
prefer the tackle or throw myself.  If you must use 10 hit strings, use this to 
your advantage.  The problem is getting to that point in the string so that you 
do hit.  I tend not to use 10-strings for that reason.

Hits 7 and 8 always hit low.  Hit 7 is always an Stagger Kick.  If Hit 8 is a 
Stagger Kick, block high.  If it is a foot sweep, block low.

If I nail any of these juggle starters,  I almost always do the Jab Uppercut 
into Head Spinner (2,1, 1+2,1).  It does the most damage in this series and 
isn't that hard to do.  The Jab Uppercut causes a semi-rejuggle in most juggles.  
If you want more hits, then Elbow Swipe off of the Jab Uppercut and follow 
through with a Stagger Kick ~ Spinning Uppercut for 6 hits and a little bit of 
style but less damage.  I don't know of too many easy combos for King that give 
you move than 6 hits.  The Stagger Kick ~ Spinning Uppercut is a good finisher 
of choice since it can hit semigrounded opponents for a semi-rejuggle as well.  

Before I realized the power of the Jab Uppercut in juggles, I would normally 
follow up my juggle starter with a jab or Palm Attack (1,2).  These are still 
good, viable combos, but I prefer the Jab Uppercut due to the small rejuggle 
ability and slight edge in damage. 

Like the Jab Uppercut, a right kick will cause a small rejuggle, allowing moves 
to hit afterwards.  This allows the Stagger Kick finishers to follow easily.  
The Right Kick - Disgraceful Kick finisher only works on big characters I think.  
The side kick can also be used if you're close enough.  For the combos that use 
right kick (4), you can no longer hold forward for extra damage like you could 
in Tekken 3 or you'll do the Rolling Sobat.

= WS+4, d+4
= WS+4, d+3+4,2
= d+3+4,2
= d+3+4,4,4

The Leg Breaker causes a low juggle float.  You can follow up with either 
crouching moves or WS moves since the Leg Breaker is a crouching attack.  You 
can also follow up with a d+1, but it sometimes misses if you are off axis.

4 CH
= d+3+4,2
= d+3+4,4,4

A right kick CH causes a juggle which allows you to hit with the Stagger Kick.  
Getting the Disgraceful Kick or the Side Kick is also possible.

= d+3+4,2

A CH Elbow Sting will floor your opponent, allowing you to follow it with 
Stagger Kicks.  A ground throw is difficult but possible if the opponent doesn't 
choose to immediately get up.  You can also employ okizeme at this point.

==============
= Black Bomb =

= 1,2, b+4
= 1+2,1
= 1, 1+2,1
= 2,1, 1+2,1
= 4, d+3+4,2

The Black Bomb causes a bounce juggle on CH.  This move is his most damaging 
juggle starter.  On CH, any Hop Kick series juggle will work here as well.

On CH, these moves stun, allowing for juggles.  However, the stun is escapable.  

=======
= Tag =
=======

King can also start and finish tag juggles depending on his partner.  Tag 
juggles are a new feature in TTT that should not be overlooked.  They are very 
cool looking when executed properly but are not that difficult to perform.

----------------------
- Tag Juggle Classes -
----------------------

I will be using the Tekken Zaibatsu definition of tag juggle classes for tag 
juggle starters.  You can check this URL for more information and examples: 

http://www.tekken.net/classtag.htm

There are 5 classes of tag juggles, aptly named 1-5.  The level depends on what 
type of move can be done by the tagged in player after a tag juggle starter.  
Here is what they mean and some examples.

Class 1: Tag juggle starters allowing almost anything to connect
(examples: Yoshimitsu's 4~3, Baek's f,N,d,df+3)

Class 2: Tag juggle starters allowing high/standing moves to connect
(examples: King's f,N,d,df,N+1+2 CH or WC,df+2, Armor King's f,N,d,df+2)

Class 3: Tag juggle starters allowing low moves to connect
(examples: Julia's f+1, Gun Jack's d+1+2)

Class 4: Tag juggle starters that can't be tech rolled but allow for a ground 
followup
(examples: Bryan's b+1, Paul QCB,N+1 CH)

Class 5: Tag juggle starters that do not allow a reliable/guaranteed followup
(example: King's f,f+2, Wang's f+4)

If a tag juggle combo works for a given class, it works for any higher class.  
The abbreviation for a tag juggle class is [TJC#] where the number is the class.

-----------------------
- Tag Juggle Starters -
-----------------------

These are the moves that King can tag from when they hit:

Crouching Uppercut                  WC,df+2[~5]             M JG [TJC2]
K's Flicker                         f,f+2[~5]               M KD JGch [TJC3ch_5]

Even though K's Flicker juggles on CH, you can tag out on a hit.  However, 
without the CH, it will not allow for a guaranteed juggle (Class 5).  On CH 
juggle and tag, it becomes TJC3.  As with most tag moves, the tag is only 
possible on a hit.  If blocked, you are not able to tag out.  The Crouching 
Uppercut is always TJC2, which will float high to allow for most tag combos.

Black Bomb                          f,N,d,df,N+1+2[~5]      M KD BNch [TJC2ch_4]

This move causes a bounce juggle on CH.  However, tagging from this move will 
not automatically cause a bounce juggle (maybe if you buffer the tag - need to 
investigate).  If it hits, you can tag.  On CH, it is TJC2.  Without the CH (or 
a buffered tag?), it is TJC4 since you can not tech roll the hit.  A sliding leg 
sweep from the tagged in partner may hit the opponent - I will have to check.

Frankensteiner                      df+3+4[~5]              HT {-} [TJC4]

If King throws the opponent, the tag partner can hit the grounded opponent upon 
tagging.  You have to use a tag-in move (Sliding Leg Sweep) or a fast move that 
hits grounded opponents.  The Frankensteiner is TJC4 when it throws since you 
can not tech recover.  Other non-generic tag throws AFAIK are TJC4 or TJC5.

---------------
- Tag Juggles -
---------------

If King is tagging in from a juggle starter, what he can do to finish the juggle 
depends on how high the opponent is when he enters.  Here is what he can do with 
each class excluding class 5.  If a combo works for a given class, it will work 
for any higher class.  Note that not all of these are tested, but most should 
work since they are mostly from Tekken Zaibatsu:

TJC1:
f+2+3
f,f+2+3

TJC2:
= 1, 1+2,1
= 1,2, f+4
= 1,2, b+4
= 1,2, f,f+4
= 1,2, df+2, d+3+4,2
= 1,2,1, d+3+4,2
= 2,1, 1+2,1
= 2,1, f,f+4
= 2,1, f+4
= 2,1, b+4
= 4, d+3+4,2
= d+3+4,4,4 

TJC3:
= d+1, d+3+4,4,4
= d+1, WS+4, d+3+4,2
= d+1, WS+2
= d+1~N+2

TJC4:
= d+3+4,4,4
= d+3+4,2

Juggles listed in the Hop Kick section are considered TJC2 juggles for King.

Let's put all this knowledge together, shall we?

===========
= General =
===========

This is where you will find information on how to fight all characters in TTT.

-----------
- Okizeme -
-----------

Okizeme is loosely defined as the art of attacking someone who is downed.  For 
King, it is imperative that you have good okizeme techniques.  King has so many 
ways to keep you down or punish you when you stand up it should almost be 
illegal. ;) There are different attacks you can use for okizeme, but they all 
serve one purpose: to take more energy away from an opponent who is grounded or 
trying to stand up.

Stagger Kick                        WC,df+4_WC,df+3+4_d+3+4 LG            
= Spinning Uppercut                 = ~2                    M KD          
= Stagger Kick ~ Spinning Uppercut  = 4~2                   LG~M CH KD     
= Stagger Kicks                     = 4,4                   LG,LG       
  = Spinning Uppercut                 = ~2                  M CH KD       
  = Stagger Kicks                     = ~4,4                LG,LG CH    

This is probably your #1 move in okizeme.  This will actually hit grounded 
opponents and opponents who are trying to get up.  If you hit an opponent while 
they start to get up, you will cause a float or a counter (if they were able to 
stand) that will allow you to add a Spinning Uppercut or one more Stagger Kick.  
It is especially useful against characters who like to lay down a lot (Lei and 
Eddy).  It can be also used after most knockdowns where the opponent can't roll 
as well as after most ground throws.

Disgraceful Kick                    b+4                     H

If you need a fast attack to counter an opponent's missed wake up move, this 
move has the fastest motion.  It will hit wake-up 3 and 4 if they miss even 
though the Disgraceful Kick hits high.  Since it also reaches very far, you 
usually don't have to move forward.  Just make sure the opponent's kick whiffs 
and hit the opponent back onto the ground for more okizeme.  You can also use it 
to start okizeme if you hit with it at point blank range.

Konvict Kick                        f,f+4                   M

If someone misses a foot sweep, I usually dash in and kick for good damage and 
another knockdown.  Since you have to hit forward, make sure you don't 
accidentally dash into the wake-up attack before nailing them with this.

Rolling Sobat *!*                   f+4                     M

This move is good for okizeme since it reaches far.  It can be used in places 
where the Disgraceful or Konvict Kicks are used to attack missed wake-up 
attempts.

Moonsault                           1+4_f+1+4_BK 1+4        UG KD

This is my second favorite move to punish grounded and standing opponents with.  
The Moonsault is unblockable and will allow you to roll over and follow up with 
a foot sweep.  If you counter with the foot sweep, you can Stagger Kick ~ 
Spinning Uppercut and attempt another Moonsault (Moonsault Trap).  If an 
opponent doesn't ground recover correctly, you can use it to counter their wake 
up attempt.  Even though the Moonsault is easy to see coming, it can be hard to 
avoid because of its unusual hit area.  If your opponent side (tech) rolls a 
knockdown, wait for the side tech roll to almost finish and then go for the 
Moonsault.  If done correctly, you should nick them with the Moonsault to allow 
for the Moonsault Trap to start or continue.  However, if the opponent is fully 
standing, you may get jabbed during the Moonsault attempt.

Diving Body Splash *!*              f,F+2+3                 MG KD FD/S

Since this move does hit grounded opponents, it should be mentioned in the 
okizeme section.  It can hit grounded and semi-grounded opponents.  It will 
leave King grounded, but you can go for a juggle with a wake up foot sweep (3).  
If you miss, you may be subject to okizeme of your own.

Sidestep (SS)                       u~N_d~N                 SS

You can actually sidestep wake-up attempts.  To sidestep wake up attempts, it is 
best to be just out of range or at the edge of the range for wake-up attacks.  
If the opponent rises with a sweep (3), evade to your left since it is a left 
kick and vice versa for 4.  If you do it right, you will evade the attack and be 
able to set up a side throw, multithrow, or juggle.  For a high kick, you can 
actually do a Deadly Boomerang to avoid and counter it if done correctly.  
However, if you guess wrong/incorrectly, you will eat a counter hit or juggle.

At the right range, you can follow side tech rolls with a sidestep in the same 
direction as the tech roll.  You can actually do a sidestep multithrow to grab 
them as they stand up from a side tech roll.  You can also crouching throw or 
multithrow a side tech roller before he/she fully stands - a side tech roll 
leaves you crouching before you can fully stand.  Since you can't throw any 
moves while standing up from a tech roll, they have to escape the throw.

--------------
- Countering -
--------------

Knowing what and when to counter is important.  For example, if you duck under a 
slow high move, feel free to Crouching Upper, Hop Kick or Ultimate Tackle (be 
wary of escape or reversal).  It is very hard to counter with a low throw so I 
advise against it in most situations.  Remember that you have a kick reversal 
and a low parry.  If you can see a move coming and block it, chances are you can 
reverse/parry the next move in that string.  Slower moves can be countered with 
a Hop Kick or a command throw since you are in block stun.  Specific moves you 
can counter will be discussed in the Vs Human section.  I have created three 
"Counter Attack Classes" that are similar to the Tag Juggle Classes except that 
they use letters.  These are moves that can used when you block an opponent's 
attack.  There are three classes:

Class A Counter Attack: Any attack that starts with a jab fits into this class.  
This is used to counter relatively quick recovering moves.

Class A Counter Attack examples: d+1~N+2, 1,2,1, 2,1, d+2

Best Class A Counter Attacks: d+1~N+2 as long as you're in range

Class B Counter Attack: Any attack that starts with an attack slower than a jab 
but is still nonetheless quick.  The majority of King's moves are of Class B.

Class B Counter Attack examples: uf+4, 1+2,1, b+4, f+4, df+3, df+4, df+1,2, 
df+2, most normal throws

Best Class B Counter Attack: uf+4, 1+2,1, b+4, f+4 (situation dependent)

Class C Counter Attack: Any WC or WS that can be used to counter attack after a 
low block.  Usually the move that is blocked has slow recovery or causes a trip 
attack stun when blocked.

Class C Counter Attack examples: WS+4, WS+1, WS+2, D+1~N+2, WC,df+2[~5], WS-
uf+4, D,db,d,db+1+2

Best Class C Counter Attack: D+1~N+2, WS+4, WS-uf+4, WC,df+2[~5]

Any moves that can be countered by Class B can be countered with Class A moves 
if you are up close to the opponent.  If a move can not be countered by most or 
all of the moves in that class, only the successful/guaranteed counters will be 
listed.  For Class C, some counters may not work if the attack blocked recovers 
without a trip block stun.  However, since D+1~N+2 is a Class C counter, even 
relatively quick recovering attacks can be countered after blocking.  Further 
elaboration will be provided in the Vs Human section.

------------
- Recovery -
------------

Certain moves have a longer recovery than others.  Some examples are listed 
below.

Short Recovery          Medium Recovery         Long Recovery
2,1                     uf+4                    WC,df+1
1,2(,1)                 f,f+4                   WS+3
WS+4                    (any missed throw)      WC,df+2
WS+1                    uf+1+2                  f,f+2
d+1~N+2                 SS+2                    (WC,df+4_d+3+4),4,4
                        df+2                    f+2+3
                        df+1
                        f+4

Ground recovery is also important.  Know when to tech/side/forward/back roll 
based on who you're facing.  This really only comes with gameplay and practice.  
While tech roll will prevent some pseudo combos/ground juggles, you are not 
allowed to attack until after you fully stand.  If you do a side roll, you tend 
to be safer, but you can be followed by a sidestep or dash.  If you roll 
forward/backward, make sure you can do it safely.  If you don't, your opponent 
will probably knock you back down while rolling, usually with some sort of 
rejuggle or power move.  

----------
- Poking -
----------

Poking is the art of attacking up close to confuse or frustrate your opponent 
into a mistake that you can take advantage of.  One of the best ways to poke is 
through custom stringing.  A custom string is a series of attacks that are hard 
to interrupt if they hit or are blocked.  At higher levels, this is very 
important.  Poking can prevent opponents from turtling and interrupt slower 
power attacks.  For most strings, if the previous hit is blocked, the next hit 
can be reversed so buffer chickens between certain moves.  Here are some  
examples:

2,1, d+1~N+2, df+1,2
1,2,1, d+1~N+2, throw
1,2, df+1,2
df+4, df+3, f+4
1, d+1~N+2, 1+2,1

There are tons that you can create to pester and annoy your opponent.  However, 
the key is to make them block high long enough so you can throw them or block 
low to eat a mid hit or juggle starter.  Poking allows for a good mixup that 
will lead to more mistakes, throws, juggles, and frustration for your opponent.  

------------------
- Crouch Dashing -
------------------

King has moves that can only be done with a crouch dash.  However, he has moves 
that can be done outside of a crouch dash that can also be done using a crouch 
dash.  Here are some examples:

f,N,d,df, uf+4 (Hop Kick)
f,N,d,df,f, f+4 (Konvict Kick)
f,N,d,df, f+4 (WS+4 Front Kick)
f,N,d,df,f, f+2 (K's Flicker)
f,N,d,df,f, f,N+2 (Stomach Smash)

For the moves done in a crouch dash that normally/otherwise require a f,f 
motion, it is necessary to buffer a forward into the crouch dash itself 
(f,N,d,df,f_f,N,QCF).  If you do not, you will usually ending up doing WS moves.  
The crouch dash gives extra range to these moves as well as provides a mix up 
especially with the Hop Kick.  If your opponent crouches under what they think 
is a multithrow attempt, these moves will hit them except for the Stomach Smash.

==========
= Vs CPU =
==========

I basically use the CPU to practice combos, multithrows, and new moves in TTT.  
This is a great time and place to practice tag in moves especially in the early 
rounds.  Tag in moves are important to survival versus human competition.  It is 
also a good place to practice multithrows and complex command throws.  The 
middle rounds are good juggle combo practice as well as poking.  Multithrows 
become harder in later rounds because the CPU will always crouch unless just 
tagging in or recovering.  Complex command throws are sometimes harder to pull 
off as well for that reason.  The later rounds (Rounds 7 & 8) are all about 
poking and countering and not using too many high recovery moves.  It is 
difficult for me to give specific strategies for the CPU since it can depend on 
difficulty and what characters you face.  No matter what round, always know how 
to ground recover.  It may save your life in combat.

============
= Vs Human =
============

I am finally going to add some basic Vs Human strategies.  These are not 
Complete by a long shot, but it's a start.  Any feedback would be hugely 
appreciated.  I have attempted to list strengths and weaknesses for a character 
as well as what moves to look out for.  I have also listed moves that you can 
counter when blocked as well (see Counter Class listing above).

Since I hate dying to unblocked 10-hit strings, I will include generic charts on 
how to block 10-hit strings.  I do this by listing the low points in the string 
for every character listed in this section.  There is no way to memorize all the 
10-hit strings in the game.  However, I will do my best to inform you of what to 
look for and how to always be able to at least block every 10-hit thrown at you.  
How you counter and reverse 10 strings is up to you, but I will name obvious 
places that King can reverse or counter.  I will try to create a generic chart 
that covers all the 10-hit strings for a given character.  I want you to always 
know how to block correctly even if you don't know the exact string the person 
is using. I will use a compressed format that attempt to cover all the strings 
for a character.  It will look like this (this is Paul's "blocking chart"):

        5:
       / 
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-L-9-0:
       \         / 
        L-6-7-8-L

Legend:
0-9 = mid/high hit (always block high)
L = low hit (hit may be high or low but not mid so block low to block/avoid)
: = end of string
/,\,- = possible string paths
U = unblockable
T = throw

I hope this isn't confusing.  I will give a full explanation with each chart.  I 
also have a separate FAQ for 10-hit string avoidance that should be out by the 
time this revision is complete.  The 10-hit string sections for each character 
are also listed in that FAQ, which can/will be on GameFAQs or at the following 
locations:

----------------------
- Mishimas & Kazamas -
----------------------

Chances are you will fighting a lot of Mishimas - Kazuya, Heihachi, and Jin are 
among the best TTT characters.  Be prepared - they can put a hurting on you very 
quickly.  They are similar in some ways, and all must be taken seriously.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Jin Kazama/Devil Jin ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I find him to be the most commonly used Mishima (OK, he's a Kazama, but his 
father is Kazuya Mishima).  Anyway, he can juggle with the WS+2, Tooth Fairy 
(SS+2), Wind God Fist, Twin Pistons, or on a Stun Punch (b,f+2) CH.  Even though 
the Wind God Fist hits high, you still must be careful.  If you ever get caught 
on a Stun Punch CH, tag out IMMEDIATELY or hold forward to escape the stun and 
hopefully be able to block the followup.  If you block an SS+2 or a 1,1,2, 
punish Jin for his foolishness as both moves have poor recovery.  The WS+2 and 
WS+1,2 are much harder to punish and have high priority.  His hell sweep is 
pretty quick and hits low.   His new kick, the Demon Steel Pedal (b+4), can be 
deadly on CH or in okizeme - roll to your right or SSR to avoid it whenever 
possible.  The db+1, his other new move, causes a violent knockdown, which can 
be followed by a 4~3.  If you are hit by this, immediately hold back to kip up, 
watch Jin miss his 4~3 by inches if he tries it (block back to be safe), and 
ground throw him quickly or okizeme him.  Jin does have a reversal, so be ready 
to chicken if you anticipate one coming.  Try not to use too many slow moves at 
close range for his 1,1,2 will find a way to demolish you for your foolishness.  
Be careful of his White Heron (1+4,2) strings - try to stop him by crouching 
under the 2 and then punching before he can get out the last kick.  If you can't 
do that, try to anticipate the final kick and reverse or low parry.

Here are a few moves that you can sidestep or counter:

b,f+2,1,2: SSR the final hit unless it is in a hit string 
SS+2: Class B
1,1,2: Class B
uf+4,4,4,4: Class C (you will cause a trip stun on either foot sweep)
1+4,2,d+4: Class C

Jin has the most hit strings in the game.  However, if you break them down based 
on the starting moves in the string, they become less difficult.  Here are the 
possible hit string starters:

Punch Kick
Kick Punch
Punch Punch
Devil Jin only


Here are the possible block charts based on the starter of the string:

                       4-5:        L-1:
                      /           /  
JIN PUNCH KICK = 1-2-3-L-5-6-L-8-9-0-1:
                                    \ 
                                     L:

If he starts with a punch kick combo, one of two things can happen:

1) Jump Kick: If he leaves the ground, attempt a reversal or throw a jab.  This 
is the best way to stop the jump kick string cold.  If you miss that 
reversal/punch attempt at hit 3, block low at hit 4 and then block high and 
attempt another reversal at hit 5.  After that, hit 7 is low.  He throws high 
moves for hits 8 and 9 so try to stop him there (crouch and counter) because at 
hit 10, he can go mid (Thunder God Fist) or low (Can-Can Kicks).  If hit 10 gets 
you, then it won't matter what hit 11 because you will be juggled.  If you do 
block hit 10, he can still mix it up if he went for the Thunder God Fist.
  
2) If he does a punch (Laser Cannon) after the punch kick opening, simply block 
high until hit 5.  The combo ends there.

                                 L:
                                / 
JIN KICK PUNCH = 1-2-3-4-L-6-7-8-9-0:
                                \  
                                 9:  

If the string starts with a kick-punch combo, crouch at hit 4 and counter.  This 
is the best way to stop this string so you don't have to worry at all later.  
However, if you block hit 4, you will eat a stun that will let him continue the 
string with a White Heron combo (1+4,2).  I think you can parry the first hit of 
the White Heron, but your timing has to be extremely precise.  From there he can 
do the following at hit 8:

1) Thunder God Fist: Stand up if you think this coming.  However, he can follow 
the Thunder God Fist with a mid/low kick.  If you're really brave, do a SSL.

2) Stun Punch: He starts the b,f+2 string.  Just block high.
          
                          L-6-L-8-U:         
                         /          
JIN PUNCH PUNCH = 1-2-3-4-5-6-L-L-9-0:
                                   \
                                    U:

If the 10-string starts with two punches, then it is also somewhat complicated.  
Here is what can happen next:

1) Punch Punch to Kick Kick: If hits 3 & 4 are kicks, then he is going for a 9-
string where hits 5 and 7 are low.  You have to hit him between hits 8 (mid) and 
9 since hit 9 is actually unblockable.

2) Punch Punch to Punch Punch: If hits 3 & 4 are punches, hit 7 will always be 
low.  Hit 8 can be high or low so block low to be safe.  Stand up for hit 9 
since that is always mid in this case.  Hit 10 can be an unblockable so if you 
see lightning, hit him before he hits you.  

DEVIL JIN = 1-2-3-4-5-6-7:

Just block high.  This is actually a true combo where only the 6th hit is mid.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Kazuya Mishima ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kazuya doesn't have as many moves as Jin, and frankly, really doesn't need them.  
He is relatively simple yet extraordinarily effective.  His gut punch (WS+2) is 
widely respected and feared.  A clean hit will lead to VERY VERY BAD THINGS for 
you.  He does have other gut punches which are also effective.  He can juggle 
nicely with the Twin Pistons (WS+1,2) and the Wind God Fist.  He has a low Hell 
Sweep from a crouch dash and his Stature Kick (db+4_1,2,4).  His few moves are 
compensated mostly by the damage they do in juggles so be very careful.  Kazuya 
does keep his Mist Step, which is kind of an auto SS.  Like Jin, he has the 
infamous 1,1,2 so try to use moves with little recovery as possible.  Kazuya is 
a bad azz, and those were just a few reasons why (the purple suit helps :).

Here are some moves you can counter:

1,1,2: Class B
uf+4,4,4,4: Class C (you will cause a trip stun on either foot sweep)

Kazuya has 3 hit strings: 1 9-hit and 2 10-hit.  Here is the blocking chart:

                           U: 
                          /
KAZUYA = 1-2-3-4-5-6-L-L-9-0:
                      \
                       8-U:

Kazuya always starts with punches.  However, what will happen next is based on 
hits 3 & 4:

1) Kicks: If hits 3 & 4 are kicks, then Kazuya is doing a 9-hit string.  Block 
low at hit 7 (always low), stand up for 8 (mid), and hit him out of hit 9 
(unblockable).  

2) Punches: If hits 3 & 4 are punches, then block low for hits 7 (always low) & 
8 (high or low but never mid) and stand up for 9.  If he starts to glow, hit him 
because he is doing an unblockable.

Hit 6 in either case is always a kick that can be reversed by King.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Heihachi Mishima ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where do I start?  Heihachi screams domination and that is what he will be 
trying to do from the start.  Watch out for the Wind God Fist and the Twin 
Pistons.  They are both very quick and lead to massively damaging combos.  He 
can also juggle from his right kick CH.  His Hell Sweep has been toned down but 
is still deadly when used correctly.  He can also sneak under attacks with the 
Demon God Fist (f,f+2).  He also has a very quick Deathfist.  Heihachi is armed 
to the teeth with ways to kill.  

Here are some moves that can be countered when blocked:

1,1,2: Class B
uf+4,4: Class C
QCF+2: Class B?
1+2: Class A?
f,f+2: Class B?

Even though Heihachi has 4 10-hit strings, 3 of them can be blocked exactly the 
same way.  Here is the blocking chart:

HEIHACHI = 1-2-3-4-5-6-L-8-9-0:
                \       
                 L-L-6-7-8-9-0:

Heihachi can start the string two ways:

1) Kick: If he starts the string with a kick, hits 4 and 5 are low (Hell 
Sweeps).  You can low parry either one of them.  The rest are high or mid.

2) Punch: If he starts with a punch, the 7th hit is low. Block low or parry.  

If you misblock the last low hit of either string, you may eat the rest of it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Angel/Devil ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I haven't fought Angel/Devil enough to give you very specific strategy, but I 
will try.  You can crouch under the standing lasers (1+2_u+1+2) or even SS I 
believe.  If he does the flying laser, run towards him.  If he goes behind you, 
SS twice in the same direction to avoid the laser and then start running towards 
him.  Angel/Devil has most of the Mishima's including a standing Twin Pistons, 
Wind God Fist, and Hell Sweeps.  He also a new juggle starter, the Devil Twister 
(SS+2).  He doesn't have many moves like Kazuya but can still be effective.

Here are moves that you can counter when blocked:

1,1,2: Class B
1+2_u+1+2: Class C (if you crouched underneath it)
uf+4,4: Class C

Angel/Devil has 1 10-hit string, taken from Kazuya.  Here is the block chart:

ANGEL/DEVIL = 1-2-3-4-5-6-L-8-9-0

Hit 7 is always low.  Block low here or eat the rest of the string.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Jun Kazama ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I haven't fought many Jun's but I will try to give some decent analysis.  Jun is 
the mistress of confusing strings.  She can continue spinning and stringing 
until the cows come home, but your reversal and low parry can stop her cold.  Be 
wary of her b+1, WS+3 trap among other things especially from Jun scrubs.  Her 
White Heron mixup can mess you up if you're not careful.  She can do other 
strings from the White Heron instead of the 4_d+4 mixup like Jin.  If you block 
a sweep in any string, the Cartwheel (should she do one) afterward is reversible 
almost on reacion - take advantage of this fact.  If you are thrown by her, roll 
to the side to avoid a Cartwheel follow up, which causes major damage if you 
roll forwards or backwards.

Here is what you can punish:

d+3+4_any string that ends in Can-Can Kicks: Class C if the second hit goes over 
your head?
3+4: Class A?

Here is the block chart for Jun hit strings:

JUN = 1-2-3-4-5-L-7-L-9-0:
           \         \ 
            4:        L-0:

Here is what can happen during the string:

1) Kick @ Hit 4: If hit 4 is a kick, the string will end there.

2) Punch @ Hit 4: If hit 4 is a punch, then be prepares to block low at hit 6.

Hit 6 is always low, but it can take one of two forms:

1) White Heron Kick: If hit 6 is the start of the White Heron combo, then hit 9 
will be low.  Blocking hit 9 low will allow hit 10 to go over your head since is 
it high (Can Can Kicks).

2) Punch: If hit 6 is a punch, then hit 8 will be low.  I believe hits 9 and 10 
are a Cartwheel Kick that can be reversed IIRC.

Remember Jun has other string series as well, none of which are covered here.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Lee Chaolan ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lee is more than ever his own character in TTT.  He has a few moves of Law, but 
he can not be used like Law.  He has a few mixups from his d+4 kick.  Remember 
this though: if he goes low and does the d+4,4,4,4, simply block the third and 
reverse the 4th kick, which is mid.  If the second kick is high, stand up 
because he can follow with a flipkick for the 3rd hit.  If the third hit isn't a 
flipkick, crouch again for the 4th hit is also a high kick.  If he goes into his 
kick unblockable from the second hit, simply crouch since it is UH (high 
unblockable).  If he starts his infinite kicks, SSL twice and you can usually 
back throw for free.  He has two juggle starters from his Hitman stance so be 
wary if he goes into that stance.  You may be able to Stagger Kick him once from 
maximum range.  His "Blur Kick" (f+4) is fast but hits high and doesn't do much 
damage.  His Silver Heel (b+4) will juggle on CH and can interrupt you quite 
easily, but it comes out slow and is easy to see coming if you're not stuck in 
the middle of a move.  His Blazing Kick is also a little slow, but it is an 
excellent tag juggle starter (TJC1 I believe).

I haven't played against Lee enough to tell you what you can counter after 
blocking it, but I can try:

2,f+2,2_2,2_or any string ending as such: Class A (d+1~N+2)

Lee has only one 10-hit string that is taken from Law:

LEE = 1-2-3-4-5-L-7-8-9-0

As with Law, hit 6 is low.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Forrest Law ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Law is the master of inside poking.  His b+1,2,1 CH and b+2,3,4 are made to mess 
you up.  He has very fast jabs and can juggle off of a CH d+2 (d+2,3).  He also 
has the standard hop kick and uppercut.  His One-Inch Punch (f+2~1) has amazing 
priority and can lead to some high damage tag juggles.  Use a lot of d+1~N+2 to 
interrupt his pokes.  Most Laws try to CH with the b+1,2,1 after making you 
block other strings - d+1~N+2 comes in handy for this purpose.  You can reverse 
almost any flipkick if you block the hit before it as long as you're in range.  
Some flipkicks recover faster can others - enough so that Law can do his parry 
on any move you throw as a counter and punish you.  Many also recover crouching.  
If Law is ever stupid enough to do the Shaolin Spin Kicks (4,3,4), crouch 
underneath the third one and DDT him (or almost any Class C counter) for his 
stupidity. :) If you see the Tricky Step, just stay out of range and let Law 
dance.  It will end in a few seconds.

Here is what you can sidestep or counter:

b+1,2,1: SSL the last hit; otherwise Class A
b+2,3,4: If you block the 3, reverse the 4; otherwise Class A
db+4: Class C or Class B (just stand up quickly first)
db+2,4_d+3+4: f,f+4/Class B if he doesn't lie down ; if he lies down, d+3+4
2,2_f+2,2,2_any string ending as such: d+1~N+2 (Class A?)

Law's 10-strings are almost as complex as Jin's.  Unlike Jin, they can be 
defeated with a simple blocking scheme if you know the patterns.  Here is Law's 
simple blocking chart for all his strings:

LAW = 1-L-3-4-5-L-7-L-L-0:

Hit 2 can go high or low but not mid so block low to be safe.  Hit 3 is always 
mid so stand up quickly.  Hit 4 is high.  Hit 5 is always a high left kick so 
reverse it if you wish to or crouch and counter before Hit 6.  Hit 6 is always 
low and is good low parry bait.  However, if you misblock it, you may end up 
eating the rest of the 10-string.  Hit 7 can be high or mid so stand up to be 
safe.  Hit 8 and 9 can be high or low but not mid so block low to be safe.  Hit 
10 is always mid so stand up.  You can also reverse hit 10 as it is always a 
flip kick/somersault.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Lei Wulong ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As TTT's stance master, Lei is all about confusion.  He can confuse you into an 
array of mistakes through his rushes and stances.  He can go into several 
standing stances and a few while lying down.  However, all is not lost.  You can 
sometimes interrupt his stances and punish him on the ground.  Watch out for the 
rush punches - this is normally the main method of confusion - he can go into 
any of his animal stances from it.  If you block all the moves in the rush 
before he sidesteps, a d+1~N+2 will usually stop him cold.  Also be wary of the 
drunken stance - he has a punch parry from that stance.  He also has other 
parries from other stances as well.

You can always counter the following Lei moves when blocked:

4~4,3,3: d+3+4 (or ground throw if he just misses)
SS Stance changes: d+1~N+2 if you blocked the move before the SS unless the 
stance has a specific parry
3,3: f,f+4 (other Class B/C may miss or be countered by a low BK backfist)
1,2,1: WS-uf+4 (other Class C moves may get countered by a low BK backfist)

Lei has 3 strings: 1 9-hit and 2 10-hit.  Here is the blocking chart:
            
                  L-L-9: 
                 / 
LEI = 1-2-L-4-5-6-7-8-L-0:
                     \ /           
                      9

It actually gets complicated if you forget to do one thing: block low on the 3rd 
hit.  If you block the 3rd hit, simply Hop Kick for a free juggle or WS+4 for 
free damage.  If you don't block it, he can juggle you with backfists (very 
likely) or he will perform a backflip at hit 4 and continue the string (unlikely 
but possible).  Here is what can happen in the string from there:

1) Three Backflips: If Lei backflips, three times, he is going into his 9-hit 
string.  After the third flip, block low or parry hits 7 & 8 and stand up for 9.  

2) One Backflip: If he only flips once, you won't have a problem until hit 9, 
which can be mid or low.  However, since hit 7 is a break point and a high kick, 
you have a window where you can crouch and quickly counter (hit 8 is mid) or 
reverse the kick, which is pretty easy to do.  Since the other two strings are 
the same until hit 9, you best stop Lei before that time.  If you block hit 9, 
you can reverse hit 10 as it is always a high kick.

Do yourself a favor: Block low at hit 3 and counter to stop the string. :) 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Eddy Gordo/Tiger Jackson ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

He is second to Lei in terms to stances and confusion due to the nature of his 
strings.  Even those most Eddy players will rely on stances (handstand/relaxed), 
Eddy can be dangerous while standing.  He has many strings as well as single 
moves that do not require any special stance.  He can also sidestep very wide 
since his natural fighting stance involves a continuous sidestep.  The best way 
to learn all his string follow-ups is to fight a lot of Eddy players or actually 
attempt to learn Eddy.  

Here are some counters to blocked Eddy moves:

b+4,4,3+4: d+1~N+2, uf+4 - you can reverse the 2nd 4 IIRC
3~4,4,4: low parry the third or fourth hit
Relaxed position: df+1, d+3+4 (if you blocked the previous move)

Eddy has only one true hit string:

EDDY/TIGER = 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0-1:
                      \
                       L...

If the 6th hit is low, he goes into the Leg Whip strings (which will not be 
discussed here).  Block high otherwise.  It may be better to stand and block 
since Eddy's 11-hit has no break points after the 4th hit or later IIRC.

~ Paul Phoenix ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First and foremost, don't miss any moves with slow recovery as you will be 
rewarded with a deathfist.  If you are hit by a deathfist, remember to stop the 
rollback knockdown with an immediate ~DB or ~db+2.  His QCB sway can also make 
you miss and leave you open.  Watch out for his jump kicks.  Paul has very good 
jump kicks that most players overlook.  Now that he also has SS moves, be wary 
of the SS+3 since it hits low.  Paul is never a fun match and can be over quick 
for you if you're not careful.  Be very careful when tagging in against Paul.  
If he is close to you when you tag, your partner may not be able to get off a 
tag move in time.  You may have to jump (UB_U_UF) as soon as you tag to avoid 
catching a deathfist.  Since he has a reversal, learn to chicken.  Paul has two 
good double-button escape throws.  Be very wary of both of those.  Poke safely 
and smartly and chicken and you should be OK.

Here is a list of good counters for blocked Paul moves:

d+1: d+1~N+2 (stops deathfist/falling leaf follow-ups from the elbow up close)
QCF+2_d+1,2: d+3+4, df+3, or maybe most of Class B (easier to counter up close)
d+4,2_d+1,4,2: Class B
f,f+3,4,4_df+4_d+4: d+1~N+2? (I think you can enter this before the third kick)
QCF+1: Class A (Let me check on this)

Here is how you can best defend against Paul's 10-strings:
         
               5:
              /  
PAUL = 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-L-9-0:
              \
               L-6-7-8-L-0:

If he goes into his 5 hit, it ends in a deathfist so block high if you're 
not sure what string he is doing.  It's not worth losing the damage.  He can 
also do a 10-hit string where the 5th hit is low.  If Paul goes into his 10-hit 
strings, remember this: If the 5th hit is low, the 9th hit is also low.  
Otherwise, the 8th hit will be low.  That's all you ever need to know.

~ Hwoarang ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though Hwaorang uses a lot of kicks that can be reversed by King, smart 
'Rang players will make use of his punches to stop you.  They will not throw 
kicks that are easily reversible.  They will peck at you, trying to bait you 
into a reversal to fake you out and get a free hit or juggle.  This is where his 
stances come in (Left/Right Flamingo and Left/Right Foot Forward).  This is 
where Hwoarang can get evil unless you know what can be thrown out of each 
stance.  Hwoarang is not a given victory in TTT unless he gets too predictable 
with his kicks.  Watch out for the df+2 - if you get hit by it, hold down to 
avoid the incoming Torpedo Kick, which leaves Hwoarang at a huge advantage.  If 
Hwoarang is able to low parry one of your attacks, a Sky Rocket (f,N,d,df+4) is 
guaranteed IIRC.  Some of his kicks can hit you to the side when blocked so 
quickly face forward and block unless you want to eat more kicks.

Here is what you can counter easily:

3,3,3,3: reverse the 4th hit if you blocked the third
db+3+4: reverse this unblockable (not that hard to do and the look on your 
opponent's face will be priceless :)
d+4,4: Class C if you blocked the d+4 correctly or crouch under the 4 or reverse 
the 4 if you blocked the d+4

Hwoarang has 2 10-hit strings.  Here is his blocking chart:

HWAORANG - 1-2-3-L-5-6-L-8-9-0:

For Hwoarang, hits 4 & 7 are always low.  Hits 7 & 8 are the Firecracker combo 
(d+4,4) so block low and counter/punish. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Baek Doo San ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beak, Hwaorang's teacher has some of the moves that Hwoarang has including the 
Flamingo stances.  His kick strings can be just as deadly as his pupil.  He also 
has some good punches to keep you from trying to reverse incessantly.  Most of 
his kick strings do have some lag so if you block one, a quick d+1~N+2 should 
work most of the time.  Watch out for his f,f+2 throw - it comes out deceptively 
quick (as does Hwoarang's).  I wish I had more to say, but I haven't fought that 
many Baeks yet.  

Baek also has 2 10-hit strings.  Here is his blocking chart:

BAEK = 1-2-L-4-5-6-7-8-L-0:
            \
             L-5-6-7-L-9-U:

If hit 3 is low (it can be high or low), stand up for hit 4 as it is mid - in 
this case, hit 9 will be low.  If hit 3 is not low, hit 4 is low, hit 8 will be 
low and hit 10 will be an unblockable that King can reverse IIRC.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Bryan Fury ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bryan can outpoke you with his jabs and quick kicks and strings.  He can 
demolish you with his Mach Punch on slow recovering moves.  He has a ton of 
juggle starters and stun moves as well (especially the b+2,1...).  You may be 
spending some time turtling waiting for an opening.  If he crouches, he can 
juggle or throw with the Chains of Misery, which is a double button escape 
{1+2}.  Watch out for the new Snake Slam (b+1) - it is great for interrupting 
moves and causes a bounce juggle. 

Here is what you can counter:

f,f+3: Class B
3,2,1,2: Class B
df+3: Class C

Bryan Fury has 3 hit strings: 2 8-hit and 1 10-hit.  Here is the blocking chart:

BRYAN = 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0:
                     \
                      8:

Bryan's block chart is quite simple because there are no low hits in any of his 
hit strings.  Also, hits 5 & 6 are always high - you know the routine. :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Ling Xiaoyu ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ling is the mistress of sidestepping.  She can easily get behind you or to the 
side of you before you even realized what happened.  She is very effective from 
her Rain Dance Stance (RDS) and her Art of Phoenix (AOP) stance.  Even though 
she no longer has the WS+2 juggle except on CH, she can still juggle you with 
the RDS 4 (Mistrust), AOP (1+2 variations), and her new df+2~1.  Watch out for 
her db+1 - it is almost a deathfist like move for her.  Her main weaknesses are 
that her hits and her stamina are relatively weak.

If you dare, here is what you can counter I think:

RDS 4_any string ending as such: Class A or reverse the kick
AOP: d+3+4
df+2~1: Class B? definitely Class A
b+4_SS 4: Class A?

Ling has 2 10-hit strings.  Here is the blocking chart:

LING = 1-2-3-L-L-6-L-L-9-0:
            \   /    
             4-5

Ling can go low or mid at hits 4 and 5.  After that, hits 7 & 8 are always low.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Bruce Irvin ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bruce Irvin has become a fearsome character as of late.  He has a ton of short 
strings that can be mixed up to make you misblock.  If you get juggled, chances 
are you will see the Triple Knee as the juggle ender.  It does massive damage 
and Bruce huge comeback power.  Watch out for his Knee Strike (b,f+4).  It is 
king of slow but can interrupt moves very easily.  Watch out especially for the 
3,2,1,4 string.  On CH, the 1 will juggle and you will lose at least half a 
lifebar.  Bruce is never an easy match but he is beatable.  You can safely poke 
him and SS some of his strings since Bruce tends to be linear.  

I'm not sure what moves you can counter against Bruce (more research needed :).

Bruce Irvin has no 10-hit strings.  He has tons of other canned strings. :)

---------------------------------
- Ain't Nuthin But A Chang Wang -
---------------------------------

This section is devoted the Changs and characters like them.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Julia Chang ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Julia is feared for good reason, mostly the f,f+1 elbow and 1~1,1 on CH.  She 
can juggle for massive damage especially with her Mountain Crusher string 
(df+4,2<b,f+1) or elbows into d,df+1,2.  She has a hop kick that is deadlier 
than King's, only slower in recovery.  She can mix it up like the Williams' and 
any counter hit can lead of losing half a life bar.  She can also mix it up from 
a WC position with the Bow and Arrow Kick, the lunging elbow, and the Skyscraper 
Kick (WC,df+4,3, WC,df+2, and WS+4 respectively).  If you successfully block any 
of these WC follow-ups, you can punish her.  Be very wary of her Mad Axes - 
Julia can do the QCB from a few steps away, walk towards the opponent and then 
press 2 more than a full second later and still get the throw, which is a double 
button escape to boot.  If you see a right kick, prepare to low parry and save 
yourself the 4,4 mixup woes.  Otherwise, you will have to watch Julia very 
closely to make sure you don't misblock.  Her right kick even floats on CH for 
very easy damage.  At close range, she can beat you down with the 1~1,1, df+1~1, 
or f,f+1, all of which can take out most King's fastest punch attacks (even the 
Elbow Sting) and get the CH and juggle/knockdown way too easily.  Your only 
friend as always is the d+1~N+2.  It can help stop strings, but you will just 
have to play defensive and take advantage of low parries, reversals, and other 
mistakes from Julia.  Julia is not one to be played around with unless you want 
to die quickly. 

Here are some class counters for certain moves:

d+4,1_4,4,1_any string ending in the Razor's Edge: Class B
1~1,1_df+1,1_any string ending in the Flash Uppercut: Class A
WC,df+4,3_any Bow & Arrow string: Class B or reverse the 3 if the 4 is blocked
uf+3+4: Class B
WS+4: Class A?
f+1: Class A? 

Julia has 3 10-hit strings:  Here is the blocking chart: 

JULIA = 1-2-3-4-L-6-7-L-9-U:
                     \   
                      8-L-0:

Remember that the 5th hit is always low - low parry it if you can.  Stand up 
again for hits 6 and 7 since they are mid or high.  It get somewhat complicated 
after that though.  Hit 8 can be high, mid, or low, but there is a string break 
point before hit 9.  Even if you misblock hit 8, you will be OK as long as you 
block hit 9.  It comes down to this for the last three hits: 

1) Hit 8 Is Low: if Hit 8 is low, block high for hit 9.  If hit 9 is blocked, 
hit 10 won't come out since it's a Sky Upper (listed as an unblockable).

2) Hit 8 Is Not Low: If hit 8 isn't low, hit 9 will be low and hit 10 will be 
mid (a Flash Upper).  That wasn't too confusing, was it? ;)

At hit 8, you basically switch blocking from low to high or vice versa.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Michelle Chang ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Michelle, even though she's not as good as Julia, can definitely hold her own.  
She has many of the moves that Julia has including the f,f+1 elbow, 1~1,1, 
df+1,1, Bow and Arrow mixups, etc.  Even though her elbow doesn't knock down, 
f,f+1,4 juggles if the f,f+1 hits on CH.  She also has better SS moves than 
Julia as well as a new high-hitting lunge punch (f,f+2).  She also have some 
other juggles starters as well.

Here are some class counters for certain moves:

d+4,1_4,4,1_any string ending in the Razor's Edge: Class B
1~1,1_df+1,1_any string ending in a Flash Uppercut: Class A
WC,df+4,3_any Bow & Arrow string: Class B or reverse the 3 if the 4 is blocked
uf+3+4: Class B
WS+4: Class A?
f+1: Class A?

Michelle has the same 3 10-hit strings as Julia:

MICHELLE = 1-2-3-4-L-6-7-L-9-U:
                        \   
                         8-L-0:

Remember that the 5th hit is always low - low parry it if you can.  Stand up 
again for hits 6 and 7 since they are mid or high.  It get somewhat complicated 
after that though.  Hit 8 can be high, mid, or low, but there is a string break 
point before hit 9.  Even if you misblock hit 8, you will be OK as long as you 
block hit 9.  It comes down to this for the last three hits: 

1) Hit 8 Is Low: if Hit 8 is low, block high for hit 9.  If hit 9 is blocked, 
hit 10 won't come out since it's a Sky Upper (listed as an unblockable).

2) Hit 8 Is Not Low: If hit 8 isn't low, hit 9 will be low and hit 10 will be 
mid (a Flash Upper).  That wasn't too confusing, was it? ;)

At hit 8, you basically switch blocking from low to high or vice versa.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Wang Jinrei ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wang is unusual in that he has some of the Julia/Michelle moves like the Sky 
Upper, the 4,4, the 1~1, the Bow and Arrow etc, but I don't play him like a 
Chang as such (and most of my opponents don't either).  Wang has some very 
powerful moves and some disgustingly effective combos.  He does have a Deathfist 
and a reversal so stay on your toes for both of those.  His f+4, albeit slow, 
can punish any blocked move with slow recovery.  His best juggles come from the 
Tiger Mountain to False Lift (db+4,2 or db+2 for just the False Lift).  If 
blocked, they are slow to recover so punish.  He also has the Sky Upper and a 
Hop Kick, but the Hop Kick has lousy recovery.  He also has some simple power 
attacks like f+2 and df+1+2 that can keep you on the ground or nail you when you 
are there.  Even though his stamina is his greatest weakness, he can beat you 
quickly enough so that you don't have a chance to hit him.

Here are a few moves you can counter when blocked:

d+4,1_4,4,1_any string ending in the Razor's Edge: Class B
1~1,1_df+1,1_any string ending in a Flash Uppercut: Class A
WC,df+4,3_any Bow & Arrow string: Class B or reverse the 3 if the 4 is blocked
uf+3+4: Class B
WS+4: Class A?
db+2_db+4,2: Class B?
uf+4: Class B

Wang only has one ten hit string.  It is actually from Julia:

WANG = 1-2-3-4-L-6-7-8-L-0:

Hits 5 and 9 are low - simple. :)

------------------------
- The Williams Sisters -
------------------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Nina Williams ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The queen of mean can outpoke you, outdistance you, throw you, and multithrow 
you with ease.  She can do some inhumane juggles even off the simple df+2 
uppercut.  At close range, watch out for the d+4,1 - d+3,2 - db+4,3 - d+1~N+4 
and other potential low-high mixups and strings.  If the low kick on most of 
them counter hits, the following move is unblockable, which usually results in a 
juggle or good damage.  She can also SS out of the d+4,1 (and some other moves 
as well) into multithrow or other attacks, which causes havoc from there because 
of a large sidestep.  Chicken your slower moves due to reversals.  The d+1~N+4 
is very similar to King's d+1~N+2 except it reaches further.  Watch out for her 
uf+4,3,4 as it comes out quickly.  If you don't know them already, find out all 
the escapes for her multithrows.  Nina's mutlithrows can do as much damage as 
King's.  Watch out for the Can Opener (uf+4,3,4).  It's a quick and easy way for 
Nina to get inside and poke you down.

Here is a short list of moves that you can counter when blocked:
f+1+2_WS+1+2_any string ending in f+1+2: b+4, f+4 or most of Class B I think
db+3+4: Class B
db+4,3: Reverse the 3 if the db+4 was blocked; otherwise Class B
db+4: d+3+4 when she is grounded 
df+2_Any string ending in df+2 upper: Class A? or maybe SSR last hit?

For Nina, here is the best way to defend against 3 10-hit strings:

NINA = 1-2-3-4-5-L-L-8-L-0:

Hit 1 can be mid or high.  The second through fifth hits are always high so you 
can crouch and D+1 before hit 6.  The 5 hit is always a high kick so reverse it 
if you're feeling risky and frisky.  The 6th hit is always low for all strings.  
Hits 7 and 9 can be high or low but never mid, so if you're not sure what string 
she is doing, then block low at those points to be safe.  Stand up for hit 8 
with Nina since it can be only mid or high.  Hit 10 is always a kick so if you 
block/avoid hit 9, feel free to reverse the kick.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Anna Williams ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While Nina has better juggle starters than Anna, Anna is said to be a better 
overall poker.  She has the WC & SS mixups on top of most of Nina's pokes to 
boot like the d+1~N+4.  She can come mid or low out of WC so be very careful.  
Her multithrows, although not as varied as Nina, look very painful and do good 
damage if not escaped.  Pay attention to the Fatal Attack (uf+1,3).  Even if the 
punch misses, the kick comes out very fast.  As I mentioned, Anna doesn't have 
as many good juggle starters, but once her opponent is airborne, she can lay the 
smack down very nicely.  Her df+4 hits low like King's and is good for poking 
annoyance.  Her Cat Stance (b+4) autoparries low and reverses throws IIRC - so 
don't do anything to trigger those reversals.  Her Assassin Dagger/Thruster 
(QCF+1) hits high but comes out quickly and juggles on CH.  As with Nina, watch 
out for the Can Opener (uf+4,3,4).  It comes out quickly and gets Anna inside to 
really take you out.  

You can counter the following when blocked:

df+2_Any string ending in df+2 upper: Class A? or maybe SSR last hit?
f+1+2_WS+1+2_any string ending in f+1+2: b+4, f+4 or most of Class B I think
uf+4,3,4: If you blocked the 3, crouch or reverse the 4

Anna only has one hit string so the blocking chart is simple:

ANNA = 1-2-3-4-5-L-7-8-9-0

Hit 1 can be mid or high.  All the hits afterward are high except for Hit 6 
(low).  Ironically, you can use Nina's blocking chart as well for Anna since 
Anna's only string is also used by Nina.

--------------------------------
- Jacks of All Trades & Spades -
--------------------------------

All 3 Jacks scream power as well as Ganryu and Kuma/Panda, who share a lot of 
the Jacks' moves.  However, in TTT they have a lot of unique moves that actually 
differentiate the Jack "family" of characters.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Gun Jack ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gun Jack happens to be my favorites of the Jacks.  He is powerful, can juggle 
pretty well, and is built like a tank in terms of endurance.  His major weakness 
is that overall, he is pretty S-L-O-W.  Almost any blocked/missed move has 
significant recovery.  However, his jab (2_f+2_d+2) does not; it can keep you at 
bay and set you up for a juggle or throw.  He has several juggle starters 
including df+2 and WS+1 and a throw.  His various 1+2 attacks do hellacious 
damage so slow recovering moves are basically a no-no.  His new b+2 can sneak 
under high attacks and smack you back easily.  He has a good low attack game 
(FC,1,1,..., b,db,d,DF+1, FC,1+2, df+2+3) to keep you guessing.  He even has a 
low throw to boot to complement his already large array of standing throws.  If 
you can outpoke him, the battle may be yours.  By the way, please watch out for 
his unblockables.  You should never get hit by them if you're remotely paying 
attention.

Here is what you can counter against Gun Jack:

f+1+2,1+2: Class C
1+2,1+2: Class B (b+4 preferably)
b,db,d,DF+1: Class C if in range I think
3+4: Run under and back throw
f+4~1: Hit him quickly w/ anything
db+4,3...: Class C
d+3+4,1,2,...: Class C or Class B

(I usually play as Gun Jack not against him...more research needed)

Gun Jack has 4 10-hit strings:

GUN JACK = 1-L-L-4-5-6-7-8-9-0:
            \       /     \ /
             2-L-L-L       L

There are two ways he can start the string:

1) Jump Punch: If he jumps for Hit 1, then hits 3-5 will be low Cossack Kicks.

2) Low Right Punch (d+2): From here, he will go into a low Shark Attack for hits 
2 & 3 and uppercut for 4 and 5.

At hit 6-8, block high for the Wild Swing mid triple.  He can then go low or 
mid.  If you see Gun Jack duck down, block low.  Stand for hit 10.

~~~~~~~~~~
~ Jack-2 ~
~~~~~~~~~~

Jack-2 suffers from some of the same problems as Gun Jack.  He is also quite 
powerful.  He has gained a new shoulder tackle similar to King's and some SS 
moves, one of which is a juggle starter.  He can set you up with the jab as 
well.  His low game as similar to Gun Jack but not as good.  He doesn't have the 
low throw Gun Jack possesses.  He does have most of the 1+2 strings that do 
massive damage.  He also has most of Gun Jack's throws and juggles.  He is 
stronger and tougher than King but not unbeatable.  

You can counter the following moves of Jack-2:

f+1+2,1+2: Class C
1+2,1+2: Class B (b+4 preferably)
b,db,d,DF+1: Class C if in range I think
3+4: Run under and back throw
f+4~1: Hit him quickly w/ anything
db+4,3...: Class C
d+3+4,1,2,...: Class C or Class B

Jack-2 has the same strings as Gun Jack:

JACK-2 = 1-L-L-4-5-6-7-8-9-0:
          \       /     \ /
           2-L-L-L       L

There are two ways he can start the string:

1) Jump Punch: If he jumps for Hit 1, then hits 3-5 will be low Cossack Kicks.

2) Low Right Punch (d+2): From here, he will go into a Shark Attack for hits 2 & 
3 and uppercut for 4 and 5.

At hit 6-8, block high for the Wild Swing mid triple.  He can then go low or 
mid.  If you see Jack-2 duck down, block low.  Stand for hit 10.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Prototype Jack ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prototype Jack is somewhat different than the other Jacks.  He lacks a lot of 
the moves the other two have - less 1+2 strings for instance.  Instead, he has a 
decently quick TJC1 starter and a d+1,2 similar to Paul and Heihachi.  He also 
has the jab and a new f+1 elbow to poke with.  He also has some good SS moves as 
well.  Even though he has a Jack in his name, he is a little different from the 
other two Jacks.  

Prototype Jack only has one string, taken from the other Jacks:

PROTOTYPE JACK = 1-L-L-4-5-6-7-8-9-0

Block low at hits 2 & 3.

~~~~~~~~~~
~ Ganryu ~
~~~~~~~~~~

Ganryu can be a nightmare.  He has the power of the Jacks but with improved 
speed and maneuverability.  He has fast jabs, a short shoulder tackle, mad 
juggles, and good poking moves.  His short shoulder tackle can go under many 
attacks very easily.  He has a good low game like Gun Jack with the df+3, 
FC,1+2, and df+2+3.  He is great in okizeme.  He has a good SS game and even has 
a punch reversal to boot.  A good Ganryu can overpower or finesse you.  He has a 
few of the 1+2 Jack strings, but his other moves are more varied than the other 
Jack-like characters.  He even has decent follow-ups from the Sit Down Stance 
(d+3+4 or SDS).  Last but not least, watch out for his unblockable.  It can be 
near fatal.

Here is what you can counter with Ganryu:

b,db,d,DF+1: Class A
1+2,1+2: Class A
f,f+1+2: Class B
b+1+2: SS twice/thrice in the same direction
SDS,2: Class C

Ganryu has no 10-hit strings.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Kuma/Panda ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kuma/Panda (hereafter referred to as Kuma) is not the joke people make him out 
to be if played correctly.  He has a fast TJC1 starter (f,f+2), a very fast jab 
(f+1 & 2_f+2), and incredible power.  Kuma is IMHO the most powerful of the Jack 
family hit for hit.  He has a Giant Swing like throw (the Circus Throw).  He can 
do some very powerful juggles as well as poke with those long range jabs.  He 
also has relatively quick power strike in the f+1+2 even though it hits high.  
He even got a new stance (Hunting Bear Stance - HBS) from which he can cause 
confusion.   He doesn't use many kicks except for maybe the Running Side Kick 
(WR 3) - his legs are really too short.  Do not take him lightly or you may be 
turned into a ball and rolled around for a while. :)

Here are potential counters to some of Kuma's moves:

HBS: d+3+4, df+1 before he can attack
1+2,1+2: Class B

Kuma/Panda has no 10-hit strings.

----------------------------
- The Kings Of Giant Swing -
----------------------------

This is the chapter that deals with King and similar fighters.

~~~~~~~~
~ King ~
~~~~~~~~

If you have been reading this FAQ attentively, then you know what to expect from 
another King player.  I don't know what to put here except use the knowledge 
given throughout this FAQ to fight off King.

Here is what you can counter:

d+3+4,2: Class B
d+3+4,4,4: Class C (Class B also works)
f,f+2_WC,df+2: Class B
f,f,N+2: Class A
f+2+3: Class B
f,f+2+3: d+3+4
f,N,df,f,N+1+2: Class A (maybe Class B)
uf+4: Class A

King has 5 10-hit strings, but he can turn them into 9-hit strings by starting 
with a right punch (F+2).  In any case, the F+2 right punch is always considered 
hit 2 in this analysis even if King started the string with it.

Here is his blocking chart:

         2
          \ 
KING = 1-2-3-4-5-L-L-L-9-0:
                \   /
                 6-L-L-L-T:

Everything up to hit 5 is mid or high.  However, hit 6 can be mid or low 
depending on what hit 5 is:

1) Hit 5 Punch: If hit 5 is a punch (df+2 elbow), hits 6 and 7 are low.

2) Hit 5 Kick: If hit 5 is a kick (WS+3), hit 6 is a mid jump kick (uf+3).  Both 
kicks are easily reversible.

Hit 7 is always a low Stagger Kick.  Even though hit 8 is always low, hit 9 can 
be low or mid depending on what hit 8 is:

1) Hit 8 Stagger Kick: If hit 8 is a Stagger Kick, stand up and block high for 
hit 9 and hit 10.

2) Hit 8 Foot Sweep: If hit 8 is a foot sweep (d+3), then hit 9 is low.  Block 
low at all costs as hit 10 is a throw (escaped by 1+2).  If hit 9 is blocked, 
hit 10 will not come out.

It is important that you block the first low Stagger Kick in either combo.  If 
you misblock, you are stunned for a long time, giving King a huge advantage.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Armor King ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

King's mentor and friend is a bit different from King.  He can juggle a lot 
better than King can thanks to the Dark Uppercut (f,N,d,df+2).  Armor King is 
all about the crouch dash game so you will see a lot of moves from the crouch 
dash: upper (2), knee (4), lariat (1), choke sleeper (1+2), and other moves that 
can be performed within or without a crouch dash.  He can also poke like King 
because of the d+1~N+2, df+1, df+2, db+4, df+4, and other moves he shares with 
King.  Armor King also has the Mule Kick (b+3), the equivalent of King's 
Disgraceful Kick.  He has the low drop kick (db+4) to keep people guessing.  
Watch out for his WS+1 - it knocks down normally and turns opponents around on 
counter.  His Stagger Kicks are shorter and don't allow for an uppercut 
followup.  He also has a shoulder tackle that leaves him to the side of you.   

Here are the Armor King moves you can counter:

WS+2: Class A
F,N,d,df+4: Class A (d+1~N+2)
d+3+4,4,4: Class C or Class B (f,f+4)
db+4: Class A
f+1+4: d+1~N+2 before they can turn around

Armor King only has one 10-hit string, which is taken from King:

               2
                \
ARMOR KING = 1-2-3-4-5-L-L-L-9-0:

Block low at hits 6, 7, and 8.  Like King, he can start his string with an F+2.
Like King, I believe that hit 6 causes a long stun if misblocked.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Alex/Roger ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alex/Roger (Alex) has some of King's moves but has several moves of his own.  
Watch out for the f,f,N,1.  If you block and get stunned by it, you will have to 
avoid/SS the animal uppercut (f,N,d,df+1) that will hit you before you leave the 
stun.  during your stun.  His animal uppercut is great for TJC1 and TJC2 
juggles.  He also has a headbutt coming out of the crouch dash.  He doesn't have 
too many juggle starters except for the ones he shares with King.  He shares 
many moves with King and Armor King: f,f+4, the df+1, df+2, f,f+2, WC,df+2, 
d+3+4,4,4, f,HCF+1, db,f+2, 3+4, d+1~N+2 (and some others).  He also has the 
animal kicks - just block high and counter when he finishes if possible.  Alex 
is unusual but beatable if you don't get sloppy.  

Here is what you can counter:

f,n,d,df+1: Class A
uf+4: Class A
d+3+4,4,4: Class C or Class B

Alex/Roger has no 10-hit strings.

--------------
- The Mitsus -
--------------

Gee, I wonder what this section is about...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Yoshimitsu ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yoshimitsu still has the best df+2 uppercut in the game for easy, painful 
juggles.  He also has the df+4 side kick even though it is toned down in TTT.  
He has more options from the flea stance (u+1+2), a new unblockable, and some 
new SS moves including some SS juggle starters.  He still has that quick knee 
(f,f+4) that can't be reversed.  He can even mix it up from the old standing 3 
(4_df+3+4).  That standing 3 is very powerful so don't miss anything slow.  His 
1,2,1 is a very good punch string.  He has a throw similar to the Muscle Buster 
(Rainbow Drop - QCB+1+2) that is about as deadly as well.  He still has his 
spinning moves - in case he gets dizzy, punish him. 

Here is what you can counter:

3,4: Reverse the 4, Class A before the 4, or throw before the 4
4~3_3,df+3+4_any string ending in a Kangaroo Kick: Class B
f,f+2: Class A
f,f+4: Class A
WC,df+3: Class C

Yoshimitsu has 2 5-hit, 2 8-hit, and 3 10-hit strings for a total of 7 hit 
strings.  Here is the blocking chart:

                       6-7-8-U-U:
                      / 
YOSHIMITSU = 1-2-3-4-5-L-7-U-U-U:
                    \     \
                     U:    8:

Yoshimitsu can start his two ways:

1) Punch Upper: If Yoshi starts with a Punch Upper, you can reverse the 4th hit, 
a high right kick.  You can also crouch under and counter.  You can low parry at 
hit 6 in case you messed before that.  Hit 6 from the punches can be low or mid 
so it is best to stop Yoshi before then.

2) Two Kicks: If Yoshi starts with back to back kicks, you can reverse the 
second one or crouch under and counter.  In this scenario, you need to stop him 
before hit 5 because he has 5 hit strings that end with unblockables.  If he 
doesn't do a 5-hit with the unblockable, then you can reverse hit 5 (a right 
kick) or low parry hit 6 (a low kick).  If you do neither, you may end up eating 
unblockables again.  

Be very careful in both cases.  If you haven't stopped Yoshi by hit 7, you may 
be eating back to back unblockables if he does a full 10 hit.  If he ended up 
doing an 8-hit, then you were very lucky. :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Kunimitsu ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kunimitsu got a lot of new moves in TTT including a power strike (1+2), a jump 
kick (f+3+4), TJC1 starter (f,f+2) and new unblockables among other things.  She 
has a similar uppercut to Yoshimitsu's, but Yoshi's is a lot better.  She has a 
few very unusual moves, including an overhead flip and a foot sweep from SS.  If 
she jumps up to throw you, hold DF to escape the Frankensteiner.  If she 
disappears, step back - she may be doing her unblockable from the top of the 
screen.  She may also be doing her crouch dodge where nothing can hit her.  She 
can juggle pretty well so watch for the df+2 and f,f+2.  Otherwise, most of her 
moves are similar to Yoshimitsu.

Here is what you can counter:

f,f+4: Class A
WC,df+3: Class C

Kunimitsu only has one 10-hit string taken from Yoshimitsu:

KUNIMITSU = 1-2-3-4-5-L-7-8-9-U

Hit 10 is unblockable.  Hit 6 is low.  Hits 4 & 5 are high kicks so reverse or 
counter.  You can stop the unblockable if you're quick.

-------------
- The Ogres -
-------------

Yay, I'm almost done!

~~~~~~~~
~ Ogre ~
~~~~~~~~

Ogre has a very big sidestep.  He has some of the better moves from the 
characters he "destroyed" in Tekken 2, including the Shining Fists (1,1,2).  He 
has a very fast Hop Kick and quick power strikes and the Waning Moon (df,df+2+4) 
from Wang.  He has Kazuya's WS+2 gut punch.  He has all of Anna's WC attacks.  
He also has the Creeping Snake mixup from Baek.  From Armor King, he borrows the 
Shoulder Tackle and the Drop Kick/Exploder.  He also has the most unblockables 
in the game and people do use them.  If you block the f,f+2 Snake Hand, dash 
back or SS to avoid the unblockable part.  Overall, Ogre is a very tough foe 
when used correctly.  

Here is what you can counter:

1,1,2: Class B
Infinite Kicks: SSL twice and you usually can back throw for free
uf+4: Class A
f+1+4: d+1~N+2 before they can turn around

Ogre doesn't have any 10-hit strings.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ True Ogre ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What holds for Ogre mostly holds for True Ogre except for the sidestep stuff.  
True Ogre is so big that his SS doesn't go that far in most cases.  Unlike Ogre, 
he can breathe fire.  He also has a few moves that Ogre does not have.  His arms 
are also a LOT longer than Ogre's so he has very long reach especially on power 
strikes.  If you block the f,f+2 Snake Hand, dash back or SS to avoid the 
unblockable part.  Otherwise, the rest of his moves can be treated similarly to 
Ogre's moves.

Here is what you can counter:

1+2 (Standing Fire): Class C (you should be crouching) or WS-uf+1+2
3+4: SS twice in the same direction and run towards True Ogre
Owl's Hunt: crouch under, run, and back throw
1,1,2: Class B
f+1+4: d+1~N+2
Infinite Kicks: SSL twice and back throw

True Ogre doesn't have any 10-hit strings.

--------------------
- Mokujin/Tetsujin -
--------------------

Mokujin/Tetsujin is a copycat character.  It will take on the moves and 
mannerisms of any character except Ogre, True Ogre, and Angel/Devil.  However, 
it is important to be able to quickly figure out who Mokujin/Tetsujin is 
mimicking.  The easiest one to tell is Eddy by his obvious stance.  However, 
others are harder unless they throw moves at you.  Also, juggles will work 
differently or not work at all due to various differences.

What else is there to know about King?  Well, here are some minor things that

King has 3 costumes/outfits.  When TTT was first released, only 2 were

King once all characters have been time released:

wrestling tights with attached tail, yellow boots (punch outfit from Tekken 3)
