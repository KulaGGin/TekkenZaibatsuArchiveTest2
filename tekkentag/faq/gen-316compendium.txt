OPENING SALVO: SOME (actually A LOT of) WORDS FROM THE AGENT==================

I'm back. I can't believe that the last time I updated this FAQ -- or had
anything to do with Tekken or combos -- was back in 2000. Ah. Those were the
days when I would kill time by making a combo video... Something in the air
tells me those days are upon us once more.


AN INTRODUCTION -or- WHERE HAVE I BEEN?
---------------------------------------

Tekken used to be a big hobby of mine before college [and women] figured into
the equation. Eventually, other priorities took over and I faded into
obscurity. But four years later and fresh out of graduation, this man formerly
known as Agent316 is piqued by the news of a new Tekken on the horizon --
Tekken 5 -- which many have remarked to be the best Tekken yet. [Yes, I have
played Tekken 4 but I am of the opinion that it was an utter waste of a
sequel. The only good thing that came out of it was Craig Marduk.]

However, my time away from Tekken definitely took a toll. Those 3EWGF combos
only come out once in every five tries... I've become totally illiterate with
Hwoarang... and, don't get me started on Yoshimitsu. Also, I haven't had the
opportunity to use Adobe Premiere much, so I strongly feel that my video
editing skills have not only become rusty, but antiquated. As of the moment I
have no concrete plans of returning to combo movie production, though I am far
from discounting the possibility. If Tekken 5 is as good as it sounds, expect
to see me around again.


WHY THIS COMPENDIUM?
--------------------

Word has it that Namco is doing a throw back with Tekken 5, ie. they're going
back to the combo system we all fell in love with back in the Tekken 3/Tag
days. So all of a sudden, the combos I've done and shared have been
resurrected, as it were. They are now back to some degree of relevancy and
thank heavens for that!

I'm doing this guide as my way of giving back to the entire Tekken community
who once gave me endless days and sleepless nights of hacking away at combos,
capturing vids and editing like crazy. Don't get me wrong; I had fun! Now I
hope this guide would at least give you half of that. While I don't guarantee
that you'll find something new, I bet you will. Or at the least, you get to
rediscover something overwhelmingly oldschool!


WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD THESE VIDS?
--------------------------------

While all the combos here have been in a combo vid once, I honestly have no
idea where to get them these days. Last I heard, they are in some FTP
somewhere. (FTP guys, give me a heads up and I'll set your names in stone
in this FAQ.) I even found my Ling vid lying in some Korean site
somewhere. (I'm not worthy... I'm not worthy...)

I do have all these movies burned onto a CD-R but I STILL lack the resources
to host them myself. In the event that I do, I'll be looking into using the
Bittorrent system since that is a more efficient way of sharing files given
less resources.


WHAT'S WITH THESE 'SERIES' SH*T???
----------------------------------

Ordering my vids according to SERIES is just my own way of organizing them
according to combo complexity and editing style. Since I'm learning EVERYTHING
(from combos to video editing) as I go, the style of my vids vary greatly.
Once, I tried to follow a neater and more 'standardized' design such as the
videos in Tekken Zaibatsu, but it didn't last. As a person, I just really like
to try out stuff and let loose with everything I do, otherwise it gets boring
for me. At least, my vids were once considered to have the fanciest editing on
the 'net, and I guess I'm happy with that.

The videos here are arranged CHRONOLOGICALLY, meaning by the order I made them
and released them on the internet. Suffice to say, tougher combos and slicker
editing can be found in the later series.

(Looking back now, I see some of the work I produced before and tell myself,
"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???" "Spiteful Innocence???" Holy crap!)


WHICH DO YOU CONSIDER TO BE YOUR BEST WORK(S)?
----------------------------------------------

Inner Demons, hands down. The combos may not be the most wicked you'll ever
see, but I guarantee that the editing is. If you want to know my style in a
nutshell, get a copy of that vid.

I also had tons of fun with Tekkenology 101, which I know a lot enjoyed! It
was just an exhibition of all the Tag Throws in TTT, but what I think carried
it was the music. =)

I'm also proud of every single Series 4 video I've done. There, you'll notice
a more 'mature' video design, and I also get a little daring with the combos
by using moves and strings we don't normally use in combos. They may not be
so mindnumbingly difficult, but they would make you think, "why didn't I think
of that?" or something to that effect.


WHO DO YOU LOOK FORWARD TO PLAYING IN TEKKEN 5?
-----------------------------------------------

I'm going for the two Kazamas, but more on Asuka than on Jin. My alternates
are Craig and Jack-5.


WHATEVER HAPPENED TO PHILTEKKEN?
--------------------------------

PhilTekken was an idea that was too ambitious for those who had it at that
time. And above all, we began at the worst possible time: two weeks before
the opening of school. But seriously, it could have gone far given enough
resources and support from the players, but sadly we were short on both.

At this point though, I'm sure it's a do-able idea. Everyone just needs a
rallying point to pitch in and make this a reality.


LAST QUESTION, WHAT'S WITH 316? WRESTLING SUCKS! DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S FAKE?!?!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Haha. If I had a dime for every... you know how that goes. Well, I was a big
Austin fan back then but only now do I realize the error of my ways. Tsk tsk.
For a student of philosophy and a major in political science, going around
with '316' isn't too 'cool' anymore. Hahaha! Well, I really want a new Tekken
nick, but Agent316 is already relatively known so I guess I'll stick with
that. Besides, it has become quite the label, and this will be the nick I use
exclusively for Tekken purposes.

Got a problem with that? I'm gonna Crossface your ass until you cry
Dean Earwicker.


Sincerely,
Martin "Agent316" Perez

And say hi to Lei for me. Thanks! :)"

These combos are part of a Jun FAQ I was working on at one time. I've grown
to become relatively lethal with the character and felt that a FAQ was in
order. However, I never had the time to complete the rest of the strategy
guide.

In this list, you're bound to find a combo you're never or hardly ever seen.
