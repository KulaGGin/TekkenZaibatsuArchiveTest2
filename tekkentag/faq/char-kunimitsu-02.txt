 { 1 } I n t r o d u c t i o n

        This is my first FAQ writing attempt in a very long while,
        so please bear with the lack of updates, misspelling/grammar
        errors and such.  To give any readers that don't know me personally
        a somewhat of a background for myself:  I play Tekken Tag
        Tournament regularly in several places in the Chicagoland area
        against some of the better (maybe best?!?) competition that Chicago
        has to offer...the group I play with are advanced/expert level
        players.  I believe I have a firm grasp on what expert level play
        looks like -- I was one of two people (SauerKraut being the other)
        that ran the Chicago nationals for TK3 last year.  I've seen Zack J.,
        Tragic and other top players in action, and I've played some of these
        top players as well.  This FAQ is designed to share some of my
        Kunimitsu  technique to better your Kunimistu play and also
        make you better at TTT overall.  Hopefully everyone will will pick
        something up from my efforts.  To get the most from this FAQ, you
        should at least be at an intermediate level of play; this FAQ assumes
        that you know the basic TTT system.  There are plenty of guides on
        GameFaqs (www.gamefaqs.com) that can help you with system questions
        that you may have.  In any case, enough with the intro, lets get
        started!
   
 { 2 } K u n i m i t s u :   T h e   C h a r a c t e r
 
        Story taken from Namco's official Tekken Tag tournament Web site
        (www.tekkentagtournament.com):

        {Not available as of 11-12-99}

        Somewhat of an underdog is what many people consider Kunimitsu in
        the past Tekken games.  (To dispel that myth, check out Slikatel's
        Mitsu tribute for Tekken 2!).  In TTT, it seems that people shy
        away from trying her because of her past.  Lets take a quick look at
        Kuni's strengths and weaknesses:

        Strengths:   1) Great poker/custom strings
                     2) Decent side-step ability
                     3) GREAT unblockable techniques
                     4) Easy to set up juggles
                     5) Taki-wannabe super-sexy purple outfit! :)

        Weaknesses:  1) Much more practice is needed to obtain advanced
                        technique (i.e. she's not gonna be as easy as
                        Paul or Law to learn and abuse, er...use.)
                     2) Lack of single high-powered moves.  Kuni maxes
                        out at around 30 points, where as our friend Paul
                        can do 49 points on a clean hit deathfist (i.e.
                        no counter needed!)

        Her basic playing style depends on her being mostly on the offensive;
        her jabs, basic uppercut, side kick, and unblockable arsenal allow
        her to do this.  Much more on all of these later...

 { 3 } C o n v e n t i o n s

        Note: You'll find my conventions very close to those of
        Tekken.Net...I'm already used to them, and they are pretty
        much accepted to be a standard in the Tekken community.

        Moves Conventions
                                 -   -   -

         ~  = immediately follwed by...
         ,  = followed by... (i.e. "3,4" = left kick followed by right kick
         _  = or (i.e. "3_4" = left kick or right kick

        ch  = counter hit
        ob  = opponent shows back when hit with a move with this property

             !L = low unblockable that hits grounded opponents

       Property Notes:

       #1: After last spin, Kunimitsu will become dizzy and fall
       #2: opponent shows side if final hit is blocked
       #3: must be executed during crouching spin kicks (before last spin)
       #4: Kuni ends up behind the opponent
       #5: special motion; evades all attacks momentarily
       #6: special motion; Kuni jumps at opponent, lands and
           quickly recovers if 4 was not pressed to execute
           thrust stalker
       #7: 1st hit after power up is given a counterhit bonus for damage.
           However, Kuni cannot block while powered up.  If any moves
           are blocked when Kuni is powered up, she will inflict
           slight guard damage to the opponent.
       #8: with a tap of the d/f diagonal right before a low strike
           comes in contact with Kuni, she will parry it and have a
           slight advantage

       The information that this section provides is useful...I will first
       give the move command, the name of the move, hit level, damage and
       a ranking in stars (out of 5) on the first line.  The text following
       that will detail the moves best uses, set-ups, follow-ups, and any
       other tidbits that I thought might be useful regarding this move.  

       * = pretty useless move, really should not be used that much if at all
       ** = below average move, has specialized uses
       *** = average move, has multiple uses
       **** = above average move, will use often in multiple situations
       ***** = a near perfect move in terms of set-ups, follow-ups,
                speed, recovery; use this move often

        ----------------------------------------------------------------

        standard throw...I normally don't use this on unless my
        opponent is escaping my sickle bash and I need to change up,
        since this throw basically doesn't leave you with any
        follow-ups or ground games to enjoy.

        2+4           Sickle Bash             30         2        ***
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

        standard throw...people, use this!  Easy to execute, allows some
        fun follow-ups: If the opponent stays on the ground, fc,d/f+3 or
        ss+3+4 will hit...if they stay down slightly longer, back up and
        do an u/f+3+4 poison wind.  Another nice follow up is Kuni's
        d+3+4; the first hit will hits them if they don't move, but if
        they flinch, the other hit will tag them as well.  If you
        take a step back and execute the d+3+4, only the second hit will
        connect, for some pretty sweet damage.  You can also try for an
        u/f,d+3. Just don't get too predictable with it's use or you'll
        never get it to land. Best to try this throw after a basic jab
        counterhits.  See "okizeme" under Custom Strings/Strategy for
        another sweet trap thanks to tragic's tk3 Yoshi.

        2+5           Tag Throw         damage varies    2        ***
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        The actual throw and damage vary with your partner...however,
        this move really shines when you are teamed up with
        Mokujin/Tetsujin, as the throw will easily reveal Moku's identity
        to you (and unfortunately, the opponent).  Obviously, use this move
        when you need to tag and inflict some damage at the same time.

        Ahh...a nice little side throw we have here.  It allows for some
        follow-ups afterwards, but it seems that the initial damage is
        decreased when you tag.  The throws only real downfall is that it
        is easy to escape, so try to catch your opponent off gaurd by not
        always throwing when you sidestep one of his moves.  Here are some
        follow-ups, by character.  Please tell me if you have verified 
        that someone escaped one of these follow-ups so it can be removed.
        By the same token (heh, a little arcade pun for you), please inform
        me of any more follow-ups that you have that aren't on this list.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------

        A standard side throw that doesn't offer nearly as much in the
        ways of follow-ups as the above move, but you can still try to
        hit the opponent as he's rising with the fc,d/f+3 or ss+3+4

        Standard back throw that gets the job done, being unescapable.
        Go for an u/f+3+4 poison wind if the opponent stays on the ground
        in fear of your wake-up games.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        A very useful throw...this frontal throw requires a dual button
        escape, making it more difficult to break.  Also, it leaves the
        opponent near you (in a bad position) so get the wake-up games
        going after this throw.  If the opponent doesn't move right away,
        the second (and more powerful) hit of d+3+4 will connect with no
        need to step back...this throw sets you up perfectly.  Another
        thing to try if they stay down is Kuni's u/f,d+3.  Also,
        this throw should be used after a blocked, slow-recovering move,
        (because of the more difficult escape) on better opponents rather
        than the 2+4 sickle bash.  In Austin Powers fashion, you MUST yell
        "JUDO THROW" everytime you land this move.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        A somewhat useful throw.  This will seem unescapable to mashers
        and scrubs and anyone else that doesn't know that you can't escape
        it pressing 1 or 2 or 1+2...simply hold d/f as the throw starts,
        and Kuni will go flying over their head.  Sometimes the damage is
        worth the risk on better players, but stick with the Judo Throw
        for retaliation purposes.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        You might be thinking "5 stars for a basic move?"  Folks, let
        me tell you, this move rocks.  Here's why:  Easy to execute,
        extrememly quick in execution AND recovery.  After a counterhit,
        you opponent has no choice but to block another jab, since it
        executes before they can even duck, it seems.  It sets up a 2+4
        throw or JUDO THROW nicely after a counterhit, and chains into a
        sidekick, uppercut or another basic jab so fluidly that you'll 
        want to be using this move a LOT.  Don't be afraid to throw 2 or
        3 jabs out in a row, you'll most likely be safe from most forms
        or retaliation and push your opponent back at the same time.
        After pushing them back to the right distance, Kuni's
        unblockable arsenal is much more effective.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        A great move...usually I use this to interrupt faster attacks,
        then go for a throw.  Also, this move plays a central part in
        Kuni's custom strings, setting up her ws+4 or fc,d/f+3, and
        other moves.  You'll be using this move a lot if you want your
        Kuni to win.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        A very quick kick that recovers almost as fast as it executes.
        This move should be used fairly often in you custom strings to
        keep pressure on your opponent without you moving towards them.
        Also useful as a quick counter to moves that recover near you,
        but go for the d/f+2 with you are within reach to set up more
        damage with a juggle.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        A somewhat useful string, basically used to slightly push
        opponents away.  Recovers with decent speed as well.

        1,2,1         jab,double uppercuts  h,m,m      10,8,6     ***
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Same as above, although I find this slightly more useful.  People
        seem to think that they can just rush in after this move, so I
        halt them with a side kick or uppercut.  Just make sure that you
        don't hit your side kick too soon after the last 1, or you'll go
        on to Kuni's 4th hit in her ten string, which any average player
        will know to crouch under and counter.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        A below average string that I (rarely) use in juggles, since
        there are much more damaging options.  

        2,d+3         jab, sweep            h,l        12,8       ***
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Slightly better than the above move, because this sets up a
        guessing game from here...is Kuni going to stay in the crouch
        and low kick or fc,d/f+3, or will she ws+4?  Basically an
        easy start into Kuni's custom strings.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Never more than 1 or 2 of these outside a juggle.  They are too
        easy to crouch under.  I will normally use 1 to move myself
        closer to an opponent when I'm 2-3 steps away, then either go
        for a buffered JUDO THROW (especially if the b+1 counterhit) or
        d/f+2 if they are foolish enough to crouch in the face of Kuni.
        This move is used in many of Kuni's juggles as middle hits to
        keep an opponent in the air.  
                                            
        f+2           backhand              h          10         ***
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        I have mixed thoughts on this move.  The obvious strengths are
        that it turns the opponent around so that you get a free hit or
        combo to his back, but it's downfalls are also pretty significant;
        the move hits high, which means any decent opponent will duck under
        it if it is anticipated, and it executes relatively slowly as well.
        That means you should be buffering a chicken with this move
        against reversal characters (see Custom Strings/Strategy Section
        on how to buffer a chicken).  Obviously it us best used after slow
        recovering moves are whiffed by the opponent.  My usual follow up
        to a successful back hand is either f,f+3+4,3 to poison wind flip
        stomp or d/f+2 step in upper, b+1, 1, 3 for some cheap back jugglin'
        action.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Think Heihachi's f,f+2.  Pretty similar...her most damaging
        juggle starter, slow to start up, and slightly longer recovery
        than her other juggle starters.  Good to throw out every now and
        then, just be sure to nail a chicken for me, as people like to
        try to reverse this move.  Can also be tagged, leading to some
        cool tag juggles.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        A must learn...this move has always been a core part of any
        good Yoshi/Kuni game.  Use this move when an opponent leaves
        themselves open after a slow recovering move to set up a juggle.
        You can also often trick your opponent into walking into this
        move in your custom strings.  Her primary juggle starter.
        Can also be tagged.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        For those of you that have played Soul Calibur, think Mitsurugi's
        b+B move; slight evasion (less so than Mitsu's) and then a quick,
        ranged poke that quickly follows.  You can evade a throw and attack
        at the same time using this move.  Also can be used to end some
        of Kuni's more stylin' juggles.  This move flows smoothly after
        a series of jabs, or after a blocked d+3+4, or after a blocked
        side kick.  On a counter, be prepared to run after your opponent;
        this move send them flying, similar to a counterhit deathfist.

        f,f+1+2       solar kick - reverse  m          22         *** 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Actually a much better move than people give it credit for.  Can
        but used to (carefully) start some custom strings by following
        it with a d+1,d+4, u/f+4, or just a bt+3.  A mean trick is
        to follow a f+2 backhand with the f,f+1+2; now, you have just hit
        the opponent in the back with 22 points of damage, and they are
        still stuck with their back turned.  Most decent competitors will
        crouch in fear of being hit with a f,f+3+4,1+2 shark attack after
        being hit with a f+2 backhand, so capitalize on this fear and
        hit them again after they sit there in a crouch waiting for a
        shark attack to go sailing over thier head!

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Not that great a move in my opinion.  If it hid mid, it would
        at least create some sort of a guessing game with her ss+3+4.
        I normally won't use this move much at all, unless it's just
        for a change of pace after sidestepping an opponents move.
        P.S. did Namco spell that move name wrong???

        u/f,n+3       hopping kick          m          32         **
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        A weird move tht isn't on the official movelist, but I use it,
        none the less.  Really, it's main use is to switch up from the
        u/f,d+3.  Other than that, I haven't found much use for it.

        u/f,d+3     hopping sweep         L            25         ***
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        I had thoughts about giving this move a 4 star rating.  This
        move can make staying on the ground after being floored a
        bad idea for an opponent.  It's damage makes Kuni's wake-up
        games that much more effective.  Try it after a 2+4 sickle
        bash throw, or JUDO THROW.  

        u/f,n+4     jumping spinkick        m          32         **
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Not too useful on its own, since Kuni spins there in the air
        after kicking.  It can be useful as a mix-up from the u/f+,d+3
        hopping sweep move.

        u/f,d+4     jumping superspinkick   m          25         **
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Kuni gets spin happy after kicking and does an even fast series
        of spins after kicking.  Because the move looks like the u/f,d+3
        hopping sweep, use this as a mix-up if the opponent got up and
        you were about to attempt the u/f,d+3 on his downed character
        but didn't commit to it yet.

        3,4           zig zag               h,m        30,30      **
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        The entire move itself gets 2 stars.  If you use just the 3
        portion of it, you actually have a somewhat decent move.
        With really good timing (and knowing your opponent), go for a
        3 to counterhit a slow executing move.  The damage this thing
        deals out is great.  Close to 50 points on a counterhit...
        that's almost as strong as a clean hit deathfist! Also, for
        this reason, it can be used at the end of many of Kuni's juggles.
        I give the 3 alone (without the 4 follow-up): ***

        bt+3          jewel                 m          22         *** 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        An average move that can be used to start some bt custom strings.
        Recovery is pretty decent as well, just don't get predictable,
        as an opponent can backdash and counter if they anticipate it.

        fc,d/f+3      raining banish        L          12         **** 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        A staple Yoshi/Kuni move ever since the original Tekken.  Use
        this after a d+1 in a custom string, or from it's furthest
        reach when you catch your opponent napping. Can be followed
        by small juggles or a quick u/+3+4 poison wind if you hit them
        close enough to you.  Also very useful in wake-up games...this
        move will put an opponent back on the mat if you hit them with
        this as they attempt to roll away.  Don't be afraid to use this
        move 4 or 5 times in a row in this manner; if the opponent can't
        learn how to get up, this is his lesson.  Slightly slow to
        recover if blocked, so don't get too predictable.  An alternate
        way to execute this move is D/F+3 (hold the d/f diagnal for a
        half of a second, then hit 3).

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        All 3 kicks together make up one of the most useless moves in
        the entire game, since they can all be ducked under and you can
        be punished REALLY easily.  An occaisional 4 by itself is ok
        to throw out every now and then, but the d/f+4 sidekick is so
        much better, so why bother?

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        One of Kuni's quickest executing moves (actually, one of the
        fastest in the entire game!)  Use this to  counter an overly
        offensive opponent as he rushes you.  Be careful not to miss,
        as the recovery time isn't as quick as the execution time.
        Also used to end juggles, because of it's speed and reach.
        Too weak in terms of damage to be given a 4 star rank.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        An ok move in the right situations...the first hit will peg
        opponents on the ground.  Somewhat useful in wake-up games; if
        they attempt to roll, the first kick will lift them higher and
        you can chain into 3 more kicks, followed by a tree fall kick.
        Also useful in some of Kuni's flashier juggles.  An alternate
        execution for this move is fc,d/b+3,3,3,3,3.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Basically used to push an opponent away after executing some
        crouching spin kicks.  Looks similar to a ws+4, and has many
        of the same properties.  Used to finish crouching spin kick
        juggles, too.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Somewhat useful if you anticipate a low poke from the opponent,
        as this move can hop over it and strike at the same time.  This
        move can be executed with either u/f+4, u+4, or u/b+4, the latter
        moving you away from the opponent while attacking.  This techinique
        is also used in some of Kuni's juggles.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Wow, a great move!  This move tracks well, and causes some
        serious damage as well.  Use it when an opponent tags out to nail
        the incoming character, and also use it as the opponent rises from
        a knockdown.  If they block it, you are relatively safe, as this
        move causes a slight guard stun.  Just be careful that Kuni is
        lined up with the enemy properly afterwards; since the move does
        track well, it could bring you to an opponents side after forcing
        them to block it after a knockdown...just don't start poking away
        until you've re-aligned Kuni with her opponent! Also, this move is
        used in some of Kuni's better juggles.

        Not very useful by itself, but it does good damage, so it's
        worthwile to poke with one if you haven't in a while.  Just be
        sure to follow it with one of the 2 different follow-ups
        listed below...

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Good damage, but hard to land.  Try turning them around with
        a f+2 and see what they do; if they don't crouch after the
        initial hit, use this move, if they do crouch after the first hit,
        use the ninja jewel (below).

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Use mixup from above move.  Works extremely well on many players,
        since they are all conditioned to avoid Yoshi's death-trap from
        the f+2 back hand.  Follow with a u/f+3+4 poison wind if they
        hesitate in the slightest after being hit. 

        f,f+3+4,3+4   ninja flying shadow   m,n/a      30,n/a     *** 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Same beginning as the shark attack, just evades the opponent at
        the end, in true ninja fashion.  Useful if you need to tag, since
        you do get some distance between you and the opponent with this
        move.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        A very useful move on opponents. Since Kuni's wake-up games are
        so intimidating, many opponents wait on the floor and leave
        themselves open to this move..  Try using after: 2+4 sickle bash,
        JUDO THROW, ninja flying shadow, ss+3+4, fc,d/f+3, and many others.

        People, if you don't use this move fairly often, you'll never
        realize Kuni's effectiveness.  This move recovers so incredibly
        fast it's sickening.  I use it in several different instances:
        After a 2+4 throw (described above), to start custom strings,
        and in general, annoy the opponent with the quick recovery
        on such a potent move (28 points of damage with such little
        risk is just so sweet!) Also useful in wake-up games from most
        knockdowns.  The only slight downfall to this move is that Kuni
        takes a second to jump up and can be hit at that time, so don't
        get scrubby predictable with this move... mastery of the multiple
        uses and properties of this move is one of the keys to dominating
        with Kuni.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Useful, IF you keep it fresh.  The recovery delay is horrible
        if the opponent manages to block it.  Use maximum 2 or 3 times a
        round.  Follow-up with an u/f+3+4 poison wind or fc,d/f+3.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        I call this move "deathfist evader" because that's what I use it
        mainly for; evading predictable deathfists from Paul scrubs. Some-
        what useful if you can anticiapte an opponents high or mid move,
        and a great way to show you've got class  (Style poonts galore for
        evading throws with this move, then countering).  It seems that low
        moves can pick it out of it's recovery and execution frames, so
        even it you meant to evade Paul's falling leaf sweep, it still
        could peg you.  I need to research this move more to see what moves
        can be fully evaded if timed properly.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Just a quick recovering jump towards the opponent.  Really only
        useful in confusing your opponent after many d+3+4's, or using
        the quick recovery to land a sneak attack while your opponent
        waits for the thrust stalker to come out...

        Like Eddy's f,f+4~4.  Causes a guard stun if blocked.  Not too
        useful; I still need to research this move more to find out
        some more uses besides the above move psych-out.

        d/b+2         deadly slice          !m         15         ***
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        One of Kuni's two most useful unblockables.  Moderately quick in
        terms of execution, and has decent range, as well.  Does not
        knock down, however.  The damage that this does is not that
        great, so I usually opt for the deadly stab in most situations.
        This move can be used to end some juggles, though, while the
        deadly stab won't work.  Hits big opponents on the ground (Kuma,
        all of the Jacks, and True Ogre).
        
        b+2           deadly stab           !m         22         ****
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Kuni's best unblockable technique, in my opinion.  Very useful
        in that it cause more damage than the deadly slice, and also
        causes a knockdown, unlike the dealy slice.  Can be followed
        by a quick d+4 to combo, but I would reccommend getting some
        wake-up games started after landing this -- this move puts
        them right where you want them!  If they quick rise close enough
        after most juggles, you'll be in range to land one of these
        right away...just like in the above example...b+2, d+4 combo,
        opponent quick rises, b+2 will put them right back where they
        belong; on the floor!

        f,f,n+2       advancing deadly stab !m         25         ****
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Only slightly more damaging than it's normal variation, but
        it has a akward motion that seems to leave you open to
        attack, since you have to basically dash at your opponent, then
        leave the stick nuetral for a split second.  The 2 extra points of
        damage probably isn't worth it, but the double tap forward might
        be needed anyway to get nearer the opponent if they are farther
        away.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        This move seems to be a lot better than it actually is.  Don't
        expect to land this move my dashing right in front of their
        face and executing this move; they will mostl likely WALK back out
        of range before it hits.  This move can be used to to evade some
        slow-executing moves that also have a long recovery, because then
        the opponent can't back off.  As of right now, I haven't found
        too much use for it, but I will definitely have to reasearch it
        more; this move has potential.  Also hits big opponents on the
        ground like the deadly slice.

        b+1+2         cycle of rebirth      h,!h       8,11       **
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Not an overly useful move, but it looks cool.  The first hit
        can be blocked standing, and the second it unblockable.  The
        only problem is that the first portion pushes the opponent too
        far out of range to be hit by the unblockable portion of it!
        If you wan to land the second part, space yourself from your
        opponent using basic jabs (2 or 3)and try to miss the first hit;
        just be warned, the damage really isn't worth it.  This move can
        be used in some of Kuni's juggles, though.


       Ten String:

        Please, PLEASE do not use the entire string on any worthwhile
        competition.  There is only 1 low hit in the entire thing, and
        the unblockable at the end comes out slow enough that most
        mashers will mash something in between.  ONLY use the entire
        string against overly defensive scrubs.

       Custom Strings
       --------------

       Okay folks, this section basically tells you how I put it all
       together with Kuni.

       First, for those unfamiliar with the term "custom string": I
       define this as a quick series of attacks that flows from one
       to the next which leaves little room for the opponent to do much
       of anything in between.  Useful in confusing and wearing down the
       opponent because if he attempts most anything while you are executing
       the string, he will be hit with some damage, especially if he tried a
       move; you will then get extra damage for the counterhit.  Also sets
       up guessing games as you move from one techinique in the string to the
       next...the opponent will be forced to block the next attack,
       (unless the opponent is extremely quick to attack with an extremely
       fast executing move, that is) be it low, mid, or unblockable, only
       you know for sure!

       I will give examples of some strings that I use with a few variations
       thrown in to give you an idea of how I mix it up.  But it is up to
       you to get creative and come up with some that you can call your
       own.  After all, if you only use the ones that I have listed here
       then the opponent is eventually going to catch on and start finding
       ways around them (either that, or he's read this FAQ too and and
       is prepared for it!)  If you find any that you have made that are
       particularly useful, feel free to send them to me (PHahn123@aol.com)
       so that I can add them to this section, along with your name!

       Custom String example # 1
       -------------------------


            d+1, ws+4, d/f+4, d/f+2

       crouching jab, while standing right kick, side kick, step in upper
                
       notes: very quick executing string, mainly I use it to get some
              breathing room and set up an upppercut at the same time.

       Custom String example # 2
       -------------------------

            d+1, ws+4, D+1, d/f+3

                           or

                           ||

                           -> ws+4

       crouching jab, while standing right kick, crouching jab, raining
       banish lunging sweep

       notes: I use this classic to set my opponent up for the lunging
       sweep move by first getting him to stand up by hitting mid with a
       ws+4, then going for the sweep.  Switch up to a second ws+4 if you
       have an opponent that likes to take the risk of low blocking close
       to Kuni.

       Custom String example # 3
       -------------------------

            b+1, d/f+2 or d/f+4 or 1 -> b+1, start string over

               or

               ||

               -> JUDO THROW (especially if b+1 was counter hit)

               or

               ||

               -> d+1 -> custom strings # 1 or 2

       notes: I use this when I have more distance between my opponent.
       The b+1 accomplishes the forward movement, and sets up an uppercut,
       throw, or another custom string since it recovers so quickly.
       
       Custom String example # 5
       -------------------------

            1, d/f+4, d/f+2 -> start string over at 1...     

              or

              ||
                     
              -> throw (especailly if 1 counter hit)

              or

              ||

              -> d+1 -> custom strings # 1 or 2

       notes: a simple, yet effective string that plays on the quick
       recovery of the basic side kick.  Use this often to set up juggle
       opportunities.  

       Custom String example # 6
       -------------------------

            d+3+4
                  
                  -> d+1 -> custom strings 1 or 2

                  or

                  ||
                 
                  -> 1, custom string 5 variations

                  ||

                  or

                  -> 1+2

       notes: based on the quick recovery of the d+3+4, which many people
       think has a longer recovery time than it does. The 1+2 variation
       is effective if they try to rush in and throw after the d+3+4, as
       the d+3+4 recovers quickly and gives the first portion of the 1+2
       a chance to evade a throw or counter attack.
              
       Custom Strings (unblockable set-ups)
       ------------------------------------

            d+1, ws+4, d/f+4, b+2 (great after being "conditioned" from # 1)

            1, 1, 1, d/b+2  (push them back out of their jab range)

            1, 1, d/f+4, b+1+2 (push them back so that the 1st hit of b+1+2
                                misses and the second they can't block)

            d+3+4 (opponent rushes) u+1+2 (good if you keep it fresh, but
                                           you will be punish if the u+1+2
                                           missed!)

       Again, these are only a few examples that I have chosen.  Please
       use some that define your Kuni to be your own; it's what makes
       yor Kuni different from everybody elses.


       As the opponent rises (aka okizeme, wake-up games, ect...)
       ----------------------------------------------------------

       There are several invaluable moves you have when you knock the
       opponent to the mat.  These moves are, in no particualr order:

       u/f+3+4
       fc,d/f+3
       d+3+4
       u/f,d+3
       b+2
       f,f,n+2

       Moves that can be used that are not as valuable:

       u+1+2
       D/B+3,3,3...
       d/b+2


       There are several different options that an opponent has when
       knocked down that Kuni can take advantage of:

       1) Stay down
       2) Roll forwards or backwards
       3) Get up with an attack
       4) Get up with no attack
       5) Roll into the foreground/background before getting up
       6) Quick Recover
       7) Tag

       How to come away with the most damage in the above situations:

       1) Opponent stays down:

          Okay, there are several option here:  A very damaging one is
          to hit them with an u/f,d+3 which takes 25 points away from a
          grounded opponent.  Slightly less damaging is the poison wind
          (u/f+3+4) which will do 21 points, but also hops a bit before Kuni
          lans on the opponent.  You have to make sure you use the right move
          in the right situation.  The wildcard option here is to go for
          a d+3+4.  If you don't space yourself properly, only the first hit
          will connect for 5 points of damage.  However, if the second hit
          connects with the grounded opponent, it will do 23 points!  The
          trick is to learn the positioning of this second hit.  There are
          some moves that set you up perfectly for the second hit like the
          JUDO THROW, but others, like the 2+4 sickle bash throw, you
          you will need to adjust.  The nice thing about this option is that
          if the opponent flinches during the d+3+4, both hits will connect
          for 28 total points of damage.  Take note that large characters
          (all of the Jacks, Kuma/Panda, and True Ogre) can be hit with
          Kuni's u+1+2 and d/b+2 unblockables while on the ground.  If you
          want to be mean, use tragic's old Yoshi get up trap from Tekken 3:
          sidestep to behind the opponent's head (if you're not there
          already), then do d+1, ws+4, d+1, ws+4...repeatedly.  The ideal
          outcome of this scenario is that the opponent either tries to stand
          up or attack; either way, his back is now facing you.  If the low
          punch hit, then follow with the ws+4, then take it from there
          (either a basic uppercut or knee bash) and if the ws+4 hit,
          go for a knee bash to the back.
                                                                    
       2) Opponent rolls

          This is where the opponent really gets himself into trouble.
          The raining banish lunging sweep move is invaluable against
          rollers; It will put them right back on the ground, allowing
          you to continue your okizeme techniques.  Some opponents refuse
          to get up without rolling (especially scrubs and mashers), so
          be ready with multiple lunging sweeps.  Don't be afraid to overuse
          this move either...I used 4 in a row to kill a roller, and I
          still didn't get a chicken.  You can  try going for a
          D/B+3,3,3,3,f+4 okizeme-combo if they roll for style points,
          but the lunging sweep is more effective in my opinion.  The
          d/b+2 unblockable has some range in the execution where Kuni
          will lunge and also hit rollers.
       
       3) Opponent gets up with an attack

          Another risky proposition for the opponent, depening on Kuni's
          position.  It is easy to dance in and out of an opponent's
          get-up attack range, then pop him with an upppercut.  If the
          opponent does attack and you have poor postion, you will be forced
          to guess if it's going to be the d+kick lightning kick, a low
          kick, or mid kick.  The u+1+2 unblockable can go over all of
          these in it's execution and hit the opponent, but if the
          opponent psyched you out and doesn't move, he WILL hit you
          with something after the unblockable whiffs.
       
       4) Opponent gets up with no attack

          The safest option for most situations, and many experts get up
          with out attacking.  This leaves the opponent and Kuni with
          a 50/50 chance of having the advantage, depening on the position
          of the opponent in relation to Kuni.  If you are out of range of
          your side kick, you can try a b+2 unblockable as a sneak attack,
          but other than that, it's back to fighting.  If you've scared
          the opponent enough to be defensive as he rises, go for a JUDO
          THROW and put him back on the mat.

       5) Opponent rolls into the foreground/background

          Also a somewhat safe option for the opponent. See above.

  (*)  6) Opponent quick recovers

          Heh, heh, heh...this is what you've been waiting for.  As long
          as you are in range, it is near impossible for an opponent
          to escape a f,f,n+2 or b+2 as the quick recover.  Go for a d+4
          or after it hits, then watch the opponent closely...do they quick
          recover again (fools!), or do they stay grounded leaving themselves
          open for 25 points of ground damage with the u/f,d+3?  Either
          way, be prepared to make the most of this situation.

       7) Opponent tags

          Another mistake that you can exploit, if you are ready for it.
          You can choose to nail the incoming character with a high-powered
          move (I go for 1+2 or f+3+4), or try to peg the downed character
          with a raining banish lunging sweep as he presses tag and runs
          for it.  

       The Art of Chicken
       ------------------

          In order to defend yourself from reversal characters, learning
          to chicken is a must-learn for high level players.  The best way
          to describe the execution method is to use the opposite of the
          reversal motion (f+1+3 or f+2+4) when being reveresed yourself.
          Well, which one do you need to use?  That depends on which limb
          was just grabbed by the opponent.  f+1+3 for a left limb strike,
          or f+2+4 for a right limb strike.  The following is a list of moves
          most reveresed by opponents in my experience:

          f,f+2                     
          f+2                       
          d/f+2                     
          ws+4                      
          1,2,1,4 (usually 4)       

          Sometimes you can just throw a move out trying to get a chicken,
          if you know your opponent will try to reverse.  I like using
          Kuni's f,f+2 after blocking Paul's deathfist...many Paul's like
          going for that reversal, and after I chicken them (possibly a few
          times), they are afraid to reverse most anything.  This allows me
          to poke without fear of being reveresed.  But then again, some
          people never learn, and by "buffering" a chicken, you'll be taking
          away 3/4 of their life bar by chickens.  To "buffer" a chicken is
          really easy:  hold down the button that you used to execute the
          move being reversed, then hit forward and the other button needed
          to chicken right after.  Example:  f,f+2 (hold 2), f+4

 { 7 } J u g g l e   C o m b o s

       I know that some of you flipped right to this section of the guide
       to see some juggles...that's cool; however, you'll need to learn
       how to hit an opponent with a move that sets up a juggle first.  I
       used to think that good juggles defined an expert, now I know that
       this isn't true.  If you can't land a juggle starter, what good is
       knowing a damaging/cool-looking juggle?  Just remember this.

       Note: Any hits in parenthesis means that move doesn't hit the opponent
       in the juggle.

       Conventional Juggle Starters:

       d/f+2 basic step-in upper and f,f+2 rising kazura

       and probably the most useful combo Kuni has:

                                   3             easy, cheesy damage

                                   f+3+4         damage + style

                                   u/f+4         safer, less damage than

                                                 realize the need to earlier;
                                                 also your partner can tag
                                                 in with a slide that is
                                                 pretty hard to avoid as
                                                 well, (f,f,n+4) if he has

        Also, I would like to thank Tragic for inspiring me to give the
        Mitsu clan a chance...I saw him use Yoshi at the Chicago TK3
        nationals, and ever since then I have seen the light.  Also, a great
        FAQ writing effort in his TK3 Yoshi guide helped tremendously in
        learning the overall Mitsu gameplan.  I've used some of his ideas
        in this FAQ.  I strongly suggest that anyone serious about Kuni
        in TTT give it a read.

        The sites that have helped me in writing this FAQ:

        www.gamefaqs.com  for all of my FAQ needs   

        www.tekken.net   great site for many reasons, but I must admit,
                         those combo exhibtions rock...thanks guys!

        www.tekkentagtournament.com   nice forum set-up and some move
                                      information was taken from this
                                      site for official move names and
                                      damages.

        I would also like to thank all those at Namco that made the TTT
        tournies run so well.  While the midwest regionals could have been
        better with more machines, I think that Namco did the best they
        could, given the circumstances.  Namco also deserves another round
        of applause for creating one of the most fun, addictive, and
        strategy-oriented games ever made!
