#1 Chain after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th hit of the Machine Gun Rush.
#2 The Infinite Kicks have to be started with 1 Silver Low or 1 Step In Kick 
   after the WS+3,3.
#3 Sequence of the Infinite is 2 Rave Kicks, Feint Hammer or Low Silver, 
   2 Rave Kicks, Feint    Hammer or Silver Low...
#4 If the High Kick is blocked, tapping 4 at the exact frame will cause the 
   opponent to grab    Lee's foot. Lee will auto reverse.
#5 No hit is required to buffer a tag after this move.
#6 This move only works with Kazuya Mishima on your team.

					    POKES
============================================================================================

My Mix-ups are written below, these are just moves that are useful for pokes and can be mixed. 
They have quick lags in the beginnings and in the end.

D/b+3
Ss+2
D/f+4
D/F+3
B+3

============================================================================================
					   STRATEGY
============================================================================================

This is not quite actually a strategy.
Lee is a player for speed. He has no long range attacks though is a player who has quickness 
and simple damaging moves. The f+4 is a good string breaker move. Effective on jabbers. This 
Is the ultimate stopper for the strings. For big characters, always use the b,b+4. This move 
is useful too. When you whiff this move you can link to HITMAN stance for safety. For Baek, 
and Hwoarangs sidesteping flaminggo stance, SSL+4 or SSR+3 are useful. And even the b,b+4.


*Vs. Mishima

Lee is one of the blessed players. Blessed with the anti Mishima power. For lightdashers, use 
Hitman stance so that your defense will be strong against godfists and hellsweeps. After the 
b+1,1 when a mishima retaliates, 4,u+3, is guaranteed. Always use d/f+1 for crouchdashers.

*Vs. Lee Chaolan

SS Always. It's the best way to escape another lee's strings. You can also trade jabs. Just
use pokes that are fast when you see any good range opening. Once again don't forget the b,b+4.

*Vs. Turtles

This is lee's weakness. He has a lack of "turtle fighting" attacks. But theres the F~n dash. 
Dash in and bluff an attack, then do a b,b+4. If the move is block, youre completely open so 
link to hitman for your own good. Theres also the rainbow kick. And the Mist trap. Use also 
the ss+2 and f,f+3 for gourd stun advantages.

*Vs. Williams
 
like I said, always use the f+4 and 2. The f+4, it is a quick kick, good for breaking nina or 
anna's strings. Why the 2??? Well, I dont know why, but sometimes I mash the 2 button when ever 
I get trapped in the Williams' strings, the f+4 doesnt always work, neither the d+1, so I mash 
the 2 button and it's very effective. Just try this one. The bb+4 is always useful her. You can
backsep away from any Nina/Anna string.

*Vs. Kings 

be very careful of King's kick reversal which cannot be chickened. Though king has some slow moves 
that will kill himself. Always be jabby when fighting against any king: Scrub or Good king. 
Because the kick is very painful when countered. 

*Vs. Wulong

this character is the one i really hate to play with. When you encounter a hahastep Lie, always 
wait for him to finish or wait for an opening. You can rush up and sidestep then do the stance
(Hitman). Your setup is your strategy.

*Vs. Ganny  

When he does his anti-retaliation attack(d+1+2, b+2) always go close to him and try to hit him 
with a mid move like the d/f+4 or a low move like the d+4.

*Vs. Eddy 

D+4 is your very powerful weapon here. When he comes to his sitting stance, d+4 is useful or b+3>3. 
Use the stance too.

*Vs. Bruce 

backstep then 4,4,4. Dont forget that when you go to hitman stance, he has a 2,d+4 attack which are 
fast, you will be hit low in hitman stance. Also put to that you have the stance which you can 
sidestep while he attacks. Also Bruce is Lee's weakness, so use these strategic ways to beat his ass.

*Vs. Bryan

Another one of them kick boxers. Watch out for his f,f+4 and f,f+2. If he blocks the blazing kick, 
he's f,f+2 is guaranteed in any range. D+4,N 4,4,4 is your best weapon here. He moves fast, but not 
fast enough that he eats a lot of machine gun kicks. I do this to my brother(The best Bryan/Bruce 
here in Manila) all the time.

*Vs. Jun

Watch out for her strings. Use f+4 always when she does her stringies.

*Vs. Jacks 

These characters are big enough to kill themselves. Lee has a special Jujitsu for them.(Jujitsu- 
Fighting style that that makes the weak rule over the strong). Parry his mixup-starter d/f+1. And 
use the f+4 always for he could kill himself with his moves.

*Vs. Rojer/Alex
 
Watch out for the ss+4. Do low moves. Also his unblockable guard stun combo(f,N+1, CD+1) Duck 
when you see him doing f,N+1.

*Vs. Ogres

His accuired WS+3,3,d+3,N,3 move from Lee is shitty here. Hitman is needed. Whenever your in 
hitman and you see him doing his f,fN+2 unblockable or the other one, do the freaker jabs. 
Its so fast that it could break up the unblockable.

*Vs. Hwoarang

I'm going to separate Hwoarang's strat from Baek's coz Bob's Flam strings are slower than his 
teacher's. Hitman a lot and use the hitman delay. Do the SSR+4, and SSL+3 when he does his
Flams.

*Vs. Baek

Do the SSR_SSL+4_3 attacks whenever he does flamingos. D+1 to hit him with a quick poke and
stop his stringies.

*Vs. Changs

I am a Chang hater!!! After a 1,1,1,2,2, never do another attack except a jab, they will force
a counterhit with their 1~1,1s. Also when Julia delays her d,d/f+2,1, you can jab her in between.
Use the Hitman stance a lot.

				      SPECIAL- MIST TRAP
============================================================================================

The most eye appealing lee move(and the most apealling move in the game) at all. But, very 
hard to execute. I already masterd this move. But it took some time. Speaking of time, 
the timing is this When you motion the b+3~3, when you see the block animation (silver glit-
ters) press 4. It is done IN THE EXACT BLOCK FRAME. The chances for this move are slim. 
Experts 8/10, 3/10 Amatures, 0.7/10 Begginers. Takes a lot of practice. But this is important
when you do the b+3~3 don't hold back or the move wont be able to happen.

Not to mention Me!!!!! Nathaniel Louie A. Villadolid. Why Lee? Oh shit what a question! I 
chose him coz I look like him before! But I dont know how to fight like a shitty player!
Im 5'4" and I dont know no Assasination shit or any Mishima Fighting style Karate or 
something like that! I just want to share my Lee knowledge to all Lee users. So good luck
and have fun with Lee!

By The Way... Here's the TZ list of the EGC players who's names are registered in the forums
with their corresponding players. I wrote this because of our trademark. Personally I hate 
Devil players. But it varies, I hate if their scrubs and cheapies. I once battled players
that used nothing but Devils and shits. I hate Twin Pistoners!

Garry Noevene "Pumba" Macay- Dark_Side	(Bryan/Bruce)
Martin Veerayah- NiNa_AnnA		(Nina/Anna) Who else???
Louie Villadolid- Nathaniel Louie	(Lee/Bruce)
Lawrence Owen Villadolid- Snake_Eyes    (Bryan/Bruce)
Reynh Valera- Reynh			(Kazuya/Jin)
Julius Junio- Dok J			(Lei/Julia)

I didnt write this to show you people my pride. That's not my principle. I wrote this so
that all Devil users who abuses the hellsweeps and twin pistons shittily, will be hit by my 
hurting words. I myself and Reynh use Devils, but, we use it him in a right way. We do not 
abuse cheating talents. Nah, there's no point on writing this anyway! PEACE OUT...
