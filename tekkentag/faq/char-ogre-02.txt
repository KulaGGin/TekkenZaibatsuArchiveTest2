Version     Date (Aus)  Comments
v1.4		11/12/2000	FFS after all this time I SOMEHOW managed to leave
				out the f,f,N mixup that I talk oh-so-much about.
				Anyway, I've added it now and HOPEFULLY this will be
				the final revision.
v1.3		07/12/2000	Edited stuff all over. Revamped strategic points all
				over and stuff. This will probably be my final
				revision of this FAQ as I don't play Ogre too much
				anymore, as he ain't as good as others and all, but
				still fun to play now and then, but I just had to
				make my FAQ at least half decent (I can't believe
				half the shit I wrote before =P).
v1.2        13/07/2000  Tag Juggles & Combos section added. Minor changes.
                        Strategy stuff added to sections all over. Cheesy
                        Stuff added in Redeeming Ogre. A new combos added
                        (some I made up!). Added how to do FC moves quicker
                        (in the analysis of the	moves, respectively). Added a
                        few combos from Castel's Ogre and True Ogre (one's
                        possible for Ogre) Combo Acts (both solo and tag).
                        Heavily revised Move Analysis section.
v1.1        02/06/2000  Formatted to fit in browsers. Minor changes all	over.
v1.0        28/05/2000  First Released. No millenium bug with date :)

*********************

Yeah, uhhh, been some time since I first made this FAQ and a lot of what I
said dun really apply no more and shit (because I'm not some scrubby little
bastard... now I'm a real tekken player that sucks... ehehhee).

Anyway, time to get on with it.

I hope you already know the conventions, as I ain't gonna put them here.
Besides, if I did I'd just rip it off another person's FAQ, and that's not
nice... :P

*  3) MOVE ANALYSIS  *
**********************

Yeah, ummm, don't go by the rating alone, like something with a 10, it may
be very good and all, but doesn't mean you throw it out whenever, ok? It's
rated 10 for its overall usefulness as a move, and shit. In fact, the ratings
shouldn't really have any impact on how much you use the move. I'll just say
what I think about the moves and you use your discretion of how you wanna use
it. Though I'm leaving the ratings there just for the sake of having them.

-Throws-

1+3
      Rating: 8
Taggable, good throw. However, the escape is 1 and the general belief is that
throws with a 1 escape are easily escaped (prolly due to index finger on it).
Still a pretty decent throw anywayz. d+3 after usually hits, for a puncy
little extra damage.

2+4
      Rating: 8
Annoying throw, guaranteed to piss off the opponent if done too much. Use
this to waste time and shit, or give you some breathing space. After it a d+3
is pretty much guaranteed (whoop de doo...).

Left Side Throw (1+3_2+4_2+5)
      Rating: 8
Good damage, but that's because its a side throw. Maybe you should consider
going for a juggle if the opponent escapes the side throws too much, but
sidethrows are easy and damaging enough, and most of the time when you get
this opportunity you have sidestepped their attack and they won't react to
try and break the throw, not to mention Ogre's juggles aren't top notch,
and they might screw up from the side as well. Of course, there is a
standing 4... use your discretion.

Right Side Throw (1+3_2+4_2+5)
      Rating: 8
Good damage and harder to escape than left (but you can't really chose to do
the other side unless you sidestepped that way) in the accepted Tekken theory
of throw escapes. Looks cool as well. The fact that for many people their
right side throws are a tad weaker leads me to think that Namco did this on
purpose as they thought throws that require 1 are easier to escape, so they
gave them more damage (though not necessarily for front throws, as 2+4 does
more damage than 1+3, but at least 1+3 is taggable). I dunno, whatever...

Back Throw (1+3_2+4_2+5)
      Rating: 9
Whenever you get behind your opponent (which isn't often, but happens a lot
more with Ogre than other characters cos of his sidestep), go for the
backthrow for some awesome damage. Just as long as you're pretty sure they
won't be able to escape (as in avoid the throw, hit you, something like that).
This will often kill or come close to killing your opponent (70 damage!!!).

df,DF+2+4
      Rating: 10
Although this is bloody awesome, do not get carried away and use it while just
standing there as it takes time to initiate. Try to set it up. Opportunities
for pully a Waning Moon off are listed in the Waning Moon section. I reckon
the best time to use it is after a clean hit WS+2. Only problem(s) is the WS+2
is slow and all, and stun can be escaped relatively easily, and the throw is
easily anticipated. If your opponent escapes the stun consistently (usually
when you are vsing pretty decent competition), you should try setting it up
other ways, like mixing in with jabs and stuff.

-Arts-

d+1
      Rating: 10
Ogre's fastest standing move (that is, moves he can perform standing, not
necessarily ending up standing) I think, and also is probably the best way to
set up his FC game. This can be used very well to interrupt and you will
probably hit with this a lot against scrubs. Just make sure you're in range...
BTW, don't use this by itself as it'll become very obvious what your doing.
Also, the infinity kicks cannot be interrupted after connecting this. Mix up
infinity kicks and FC,df+2 after a connected d+1. If blocked, if you opponent
is smart they'll know to poke you out of any further attacks.

1,1
      Rating: 10
Good to keep the pressure on an opponent and can be used in a lot in custom
strings. Make sure you never do a single 1, as the recovery is slower than
doing a 1,1. And although not the best, it can be used to interrupt. Only
thing is that the second hit (and thus the third) will only hit if the first
was CH now I think.

1,2
      Rating: 10
Essentially the same above. What's better about using this is that it does 7
points more damage than 1,1, and also it has 1 more frame of advantage (...),
what's better about using 1,1 is that you can chain it to 1,1>2 if you get CH,
but that's IF you get CH. It's up to you and what you plan to do. If you are
custom stringing, then 1,2 is better (more damage, more frame advantage), if
not, maybe 1,1 (you can still go for a 1,2 if you aren't custom stringing).

1,1>2
      Rating: 9
Enough damage to sufficiently punish someone when you interrupt them. Also,
since the last hit can be delayed, as long as you don't get carried away (like
me sometimes *sigh*) you won't be screwed when they block the 2, cos you can
stop if they block the 1,1. As mentioned above, the 2 ain't guaranteed unless
on CH.

1,2,2
      Rating: 5
Good damage, and if you hit with it, you can usually follow up with a 1,1,2
and hit (depending on what the opponent does, if they do a 8 frame jab,
you'll get hit). However, all hit high and if they crouch under you will be
left open, the recovery time isn't that good, and you can't delay the last
hit, making it all or nothing (well, 1,2 anyway). The recovery isn't good
though. Overall, this is as useful as the Mishima's 1,2,2!!! Which is not
to say very much...

2,2
      Rating: 6
This is rated that little bit higher than 1,2,2 due to its inescapability
(what a big word) ie. if the first hits, the second will, while with the
1,2,2 I think the third hit ain't always guaranteed and can be ducked
anyway, but with this the opponent might not react in time, and if the
first *10 frame* jab hits, so does the second, for some nice damage. Use
this now and then if you are VERY SURE that you'll interrupt. However,
don't overuse because they ducked under it, you'll eat a WS attack.

df+1
      Rating: 10
Even though this is 10, you shouldn't get carried away. If you do this too
much, you'll often get interrupted with quick jabs (Mishima's 1,1,2...). 
This should be used often, as it can set up some other stuff, like a d+1 
guaranteed if you hit, just don't do it over and over. Also, this is
uncounterable (reversals and parriess), hits mid, recovers quick so is
relatively safe apart from quick jabs. If you are blocked, you will be safe
and have enough time to block attacks they try. Generally only use when
making a move to attack. Even on minor counter there isn't much point cos
it takes 14 frames, and I'm pretty sure a hopkick takes 14 frames as well.

df+1,2
      Rating: 7
This isn't really much use, but you can use now and then to throw the
opponent off if he's happy on coming on right after a blocked df+1, but
prolly won't work anyhows. Other than that, there isn't much point as the 2
can still be blocked even if the df+1 hit. On the plus, the 2 is
irreversable and if blocked, you'll be at a -6 frame advantage, so nothing
guaranteed against you (though a throw would be annoying to avoid). Maybe
you could use it to waste that *little* bit of time and keep the pressure
on the opponent. Overall, it's not that bad a move, but the df+1 is a
better option (if only it was like Bruce's... and if only Ogre had triple
knees...).

df+2
      Rating: 7
This is a pretty good move as its mid, causes a stagger when it hits (or
lift stun on big characters) giving you the initiative over your opponent
and forcing them back, and juggles on counter hit. Mix this in with custom
strings and pokes and stuff to make it more effective. IMO, you should
avoid using this by itself because it isn't that fast. Decent, but not to
be overused.

4
      Rating: 7
This is a powerful move for just a standard one (however, weaker, slower and
less range [?] since T3). The key to using this effectively is using it at
the right time. If you get predictable, it will get ducked under it and
you'll get punished. Use mostly on minor counter of if you anticipate the
opponent rushing in (as well as attacks that move in eg. Deathfist). After
sidestepping an attack, this is a decent option (it all comes down to the
actual situation).

d+4
      Rating: 8
Good range, comes out quick, hits low... a very good poke. Mix this around
while poking to keep them guessing. Can also be used in okizeme if you wanna
play safe, cos if you miss, it isn't as bad as missing with d+4,4 (either way
it's not good to whiff). Might as well go for a d+3 if you're playing safe,
as it will hit grounded opponents and I'm pretty sure it'll do more damage).
This is -11 disadvantage when blocked, and -12 on hit (WTF?), and on CH is 0.
So even on a hit, don't overextend yourself because you're likely to get hurt.

d+4,4
      Rating: 6
Only use against opponents you are sure won't duck under, and even then, don't
do it too much as they will catch on. Just mix it up, but do a single d+4 a
lot more than you do the full d+4,4. The main use for d+4,4 is in okizeme and
juggles, other than that, it shouldn't be overused, or even used cept when
you've never used it and the opponent won't react to duck. Hmmmm, this move
is barely any better than Hwoarang's d+4,4, and his at least juggles... :P

df+4
      Rating: 9
Quite fast and good range, this is another good poking tool. It can also be
mixed up in custom strings. Use this to keep your opponent at a distance or
while you are at a distance (not too far though). This recovers quick and so
this move is pretty safe overall.

uf+4
      Rating: 8
Probably Ogre's most reliable juggle starter. This has good priority, range,
speed, but its recover is not too good if blocked. This is probably best 
used on minor counter to set up some good damage from juggles when you have 
little fear of them blocking. You could possible use this to interrupt moves,
but you'll have to anticipate, but it still is pretty quick (14 frames?).

f+4
      Rating: 5
They only time I use this move is by accident... This is slow to come out, and
you'll most likely either get interrupted or they'll just block. However, if
your opponent does like to block a lot, this will give you a frame advantage
(11) over them, and you should be able to safely follow up with quick attacks
such as jabs, d+4,[4], and most likely even a throw (prolly need to move in).

WS+4,4
      Rating: 8
This is a pretty quick move off the crouch, and recovers quicker than the
WS+3,3 by a little, but I prefer the WS+3,3 over this as that can lead to
infinite kicks which will knock them away anyway, so the faster recovery
doesn't really matter. But that doesn't make this any worse, it's just that
the WS+3,3 has more options (and scrubs get wasted by infinite kicks). BTW,
this does that little more damage (4 points) than WS+3,3 (unless you do the
d+3,3 which is guaranteed anyway...). However, in juggles when only the 2
first kicks will hit (therefore the for WS+3,3 any continuation will miss),
this is better due to the higher damage (however, I did figure out a few
juggles on big guys where the first 4 infinity kicks will hit... :P).

f,f+3
      Rating: 5
This move is very slow and very easy to see coming. I really never use this,
it's just too easy to interrupt, block, avoid, whatever (even get thrown
during the windup). At least you can combo (pretty pathetically) off it.

WS+3,3
      Rating: 9
Slightly faster to do than the WS+4,4, I prefer this one. This will inflict
a fair amount of damage if they connect, a little less than WS+4,4, but the
first two infinite kicks are guaranteed, and they will more than make up for
the damage. The only reason why I rate this higher is because of the infinite 
kicks after (the slight slower recovery is cancelled out by the slight faster 
start up - I think they get knocked back far enough so that you should be 
relatively safe anyway). If you reckon they will block in time and you need
some space the WS+4,4 is probably a better option, however, as it recovers
quicker.

WS+3,3,d+3(U~_D~_N~)3,3...
      Rating: 8.5
This is pretty powerful (especially if you go on for infinite against
scrubs...) and the first four hits are guaranteed once the first connects. If
you block something low (or duck something high), this is a good retaliation
move, though there are others (again depends on the situation). I wouldn't go
past the first four kicks (ie. WS+3,3,d+3,3) unless the opponent was a stupid
ass scrub :). BTW, it's prolly safer to do WS+3,3,df+3 as it does nearly as
much damage, still guaranteed, and it can't be lowparried. Of course, if you
react well you could do d+3,3 when the first two kicks hit, or df+3 when they
don't.

FC+3,3,d+3
      Rating: 7
I used to love the snake kick variations, but they aren't so good out of
combos now (and also now that I use True Ogre, there are much better things
to do). Not to mention since I first wrote this FAQ, I myself have been able
to tell the difference between the enders on reaction, and I ain't some top
shit player myself... soooo.... If you hit, you are at disadvantage so
don't really try anything unless you are vsing a scrub. If blocked you are
as good as dead. BTW, tis can be done that little bit quicker by going
DF+3... (have to delay the 3 that little bit so you don't do a df+3) or
d~DF+3... (also d~DB+3... as well. You could consider this stuff as an
instant FC, hehe) to skip the sidestep check when down is pressed. You'll
get what I'm talking about once you have a couple of tries or know how an
instant WS works.

FC+3,3,N+3[~5]
      Rating: 7.5
Same as above really. This version does A LOT of damage if it all hits, and
can lead up to some rather damaging juggles. You can also tag out of this to
get Ogre tagged out safely. If blocked, you will be at -17 frames andthey
will be knocked back a little. Pretty dangerous really, and I think EWGF
will hit... This is pretty much best used in juggles. This can also use the
same technique explained above to make it go quicker.

f,f+4
      Rating: 5
This is ok, and if it's blocked it'll cause a block stagger in which case you
can play a guessing game of sorts (d+1 is the safest option though I think,
and sets up for your FC guessing game - hoorah) as the recovery is equal.
However, against smarter opponents, this is VERY risky, cos it can be
sidestepped, ducked, and hit during the start up, so don't use it unless
you're sure they aren't expecting it (or will crouch, sidestep and stuff,
which good players will do (sidestep) when they see you coming in, so even
when they don't expect it you'll prolly miss :( ). They only time that it
would be relatively safe to use in a high level of competition is to attack
a tagging in opponent, but only if this is probably the only thing with
enough range to hit. In any case, whenver you use this, use at a MODERATE
range only, don't overestimate it, cos even though Ogre travels far, only
the middle part is *active* ie. hits. After that he's still slowing down
and open to all sorts of attack :(

f,f,N+4
      Rating: 9
This is a bastard of a move. Against standing opponents I wouldn't use, but
it isn't that bad (sorta fakes 'em out with the neutral part and all), but if
you get blocked, you'll be at -18 frames. How safe you are depends on how far
away you were when you connected though (if you hit with full reach, you
should be safe from retaliation). Against grounded opponents this kicks some
major ass, being probably his best okizeme attack, as it hits opponents doing
a variety of things to get up, has relatively good recovery (when you hit a
grounded/getting up opponent) and its range can be rather long (and short
if you're quick), due to the f,f,N, which also makes it able to be mixed up
with other moves. Use liberally against backrolling scrubs, they will get
wasted in no time.

WS+2
      Rating: 6.5
Awesome move. No wait, WAS an awesome move. On clean hit, you can go for uf+4
for a juggle, a Waning Moon, or just hit 4 for some bloody high damage (though
not as high as a juggle or Waning Moon and followups, but still bloody high).
If blocked, I think you are more or less screwed. This is ok off an instant WS
though it's still pretty slow. BTW, this is irreversable with the exception
of Jin and Jun (Why, you ask? The move's from Kazuya, think about it).
Problems are that the stun can be escaped (by holding foward or tagging) and
that, as mentioned various other times, it's been toned down a lot since T3.
However, if you use it at the right time (in which case you might catch you
opponent off guard and maybe he won't escape) this can do a LOT of damage.
High damage potential (potential that is, ever getting the damage potential
to the fullest is another question), but also VERY high risk factor.

FC,f+1
      Rating: 6.5
This isn't that good, but if you hit, they crumple (unlike how FC,f+2 needs a
counter hit, and if not they get to whoop your ass), and if you are blocked,
they get knocked away anyway. Anyway, this and WS+2 (hit mid) can be mixed up
around with FC+3,3 whatever and FC,df+2 (they hit low), you can use the FC,f+2
for a mid hit mixup, but you recover slower than they do, EVEN WHEN YOU HIT!
(unless on counter, but if they try to anitcipate a low and try to block, you
won't get a counter, so that's why this is alright to use now and then, though
WS+2 is prolly better if you wanted to substitute the FC,f+2, but then again
FC,f+1 is sort of delayed, causes a sort of fake out. Even then, WS+2 ain't
that good, so infinity kicks, tsunami kicks [WS+4,4] or uf+4 hopkick). Using
a trick in Cosmic Forge's Yoshi FAQ, I've adapted it to make this move go 
faster. Just go DF~f+1 and this will come out a lot quicker than usual. Also
d~DF,f+1 works. Same thing I mentioned for snake kicks.

FC,f+2
      Rating: 7
I prefer not to use too much cos of the totally pov recovery even on a hit.
However, if it'll kill them (it does a fair bit of damage so this might
happen often), it won't matter will it? Or if you are FC and they start to
come in with a move or something, you should be able to get a counter (it's
priority is quite good). I *think* this is irreversable (last time I check
on Zaibatsu - which was ages ago), so not sure. This can also use the trick
mentioned above.

FC,df+2
      Rating: 8
Hits low, comes out *pretty* fast (actually, it takes 20 frames, 1/3 of a sec,
which isn't too fast, but most people don't see it coming quick enough to
block low. In any case, for the overall damage you can get [guaranteed
f,f+1+2. But that's been toned down a lot now. FC+3,3,N+3 is pretty good,
I think might do more damage and it's taggable. True Ogre has WAAAAYYY better
followups anyway :D] it's a pretty fast move considering). The guaranteed
f,f+1+2 makes taking the risk of its poor recovery worthwhile, well, not
 really, but True Ogre's followups makes it definately worthwile! If you DO
get blocked, hope that they will sit there blocking... best
bet is to prolly hold back and stand guard (in case they went for a WS
launcher and were EXTREMELY slow to get it off) and kiss your ass goodbye.
This can be done quicker using the original trick Cosmic Forge had in his
Yoshi FAQ. Just go DF+2 (or maybe DF,2). The trick is to hold it for that
little bit till Ogre starts crouch walking foward, or if you time it you'll
barely see him crouch walk. Again you could do d~DF+2 or however it should be
notated, just figure out the timing yourself :P.

d,db+4(CH)[~5]
      Rating: 7.5
This is a pretty good move (nowhere near as good as Lee's... but then, if Ogre
had a class 1 launcher... time to kick some ass! Well, if TRUE OGRE had a
class 1 more like it :D), juggles on counter hit, but it's wind up is slow.
If you are blocked, they get hit too far back to retaliate anyway, if you hit
(non-counter), run in for some okizeme, prolly something like f,f,N+4, or
mixups if they roll back or get up etc. If you hit on counter, do any uf+4
juggle really (but for a flashy (and disgustingly pathetic) juggle, do a
d,db+4(CH),ub+3, and then a 4~3 if they stay down. Looks pretty cool, what,
with all the flipping around and stuff :P). Use now and then cos it's quite
powerful and *relatively* safe, but don't get carried away as their are safer
juggles starters (and if they sidestep it, you are in for some hurting).

SS+4
      Rating: 7.5
Pretty good move, adds to Ogre's sidestepping game (low attack off the
sidestep, hoorah) and juggles. Don't get carried away with this or you will
get low parried (ie. don't go crazy on the sidestep and SS+4 whenever you're
in range), do it if you successfully sidestep an attack (though better stuff
to do, but if they in the middle of a combo this oughtta interrupt them). BTW,
if you wanna do his good ol' sidestep then standing 4, just press b+4 to
sidestep cancel and do a standing 4.

4~3
      Rating: 5.5
DO NOT use on a standing opponent, it is easy to see coming, and so they can
interrupt it or just block and okizeme you. Do not use against techrollers or
siderollers. Only use against backrollers of people who like to stay on the
ground, do ankle kicks, recover crouching or recover with a sweep (and Lei
players who can't stay standing... but then again better okizeme moves). On
the up side, it does do some nice damage, but rarely hits anywayz. Also, this
is supposed to be able to be done by doing uf+4~3 to make it faster like Jin
and stuff.

uf+3,4,3
      Rating: 7
Rather average move, but does some nice damage when it connects, and you're
relatively safe if they block (7 frame advantage). d+1 is prolly the best
thing to do, or if you think they will remain blocking do a throw (Waning
Moon is good, though not guaranteed as in T3, but you have 7 frames of
advantage, and the throw takes 12 frames to perform, and provided that you
*buffer* it [do the df motion while Ogre is still recovering], they will
only have 5 frames to do something ie. nothing, cept Yoshi flash which dun
work on throws I think). Don't overuse this as well, as it can be
interrupted pretty easily (27 frame windup!), especially if you try it at
close range.

This can be used against tagging in (not much point though, cept to be fancy

opponents. Pretty gay though, many better things to do. But not as gay as...

ub+3,2[~5]
      Rating: 4
This move is gay. Really gay. They only times you should EVER use this is when
1) You connect with the ub+3 on a big character, this will hit (in which case
you can safely tag out, but that is like the only situation this will be
useful. Ever.), 2) You've always done the single ub+3 your opponent won't
expect this and runs in after and then gets whacked (this would only happen on
below average players, possibly on better players but only because of the
technicality that it would be possible and 3) You are stupid, you want to get
hit, or maybe if you're kicking ass and you are just fooling around, but even
then, I'd rather do the b,b+1+2 unblockable repeatedly. Oh, and 4) You are
vsing either a beginner or a REALLY, REALLY, REALLY STUPID scrub. Ok, I may
be condemning this move, but any uses for this that anyone may have found
other than in combo and stuff, as in when facing each other, please tell me
and I will glady find a way to show you the moves sux :P. Anyway, use your
discretion, but I'm sure you'd figure out yourself you don't really wanna
use this.

Although this is a pretty good and safe move, you should use it only at the
right time. Like if the opponent wiffs and this is the only thing that can
reach in time, or off sidesteps and the like... use your discretion. Don't
just pull this out when you're facing each other and doing nothing, cos it's
easy to see coming and so easily blocked (if you ain't interrupted and CH),
it's pretty easy to reverse (but this prolly won't happen, and if it does,
this move is too easy to chicken :P BTW, chickens may differ for different
ppl eg. for Jin you gotta do uf+2+4  I think - and I don't know anymore so
you'll hafta find out from other ppl/places whatever). Well, you might
wanna use when facing each other just do put pressure on them and knock
them back, but if they just know you're gonna do it, don't do it... oh
yeah, even though this seems to track very well (if you do it under an
opponent who you hit into the air, it will make Ogre spin like crazy,
nearly 180 degree coverage), it seems to be able to be sidestepped
relatively easily. Can be used against techrollers sometimes. In any case,
this is most useful for its range and nice damage (often as a juggle ender,
but I tend to use other moves like 4 or FC+3,3,N+3, depending on
situation), but don't use it too often.

Very powerful (well, WAS. But it still packs a punch). Use only after a
FC,df+2 hits, or in okizeme, but not against standing opponents (unless they
have no skill), as it is easy to see coming, can be sidestepped, can be
reversed (though it is chickenable, with f+2+4), but at least it knocks them
far back if it's blocked. This is pretty much a (techable) juggle-ender and
okizeme specific move.

This move is crap. It doesn't track at all, so it can be sidestepped easily;
Ogre doesn't hit until he's finished the jump, so it's easily interruptable;
and it can be reversed (chickenable with f+2+4, even though his left arm is
grabbed [for Jin anyway]... weird). The only time this will be useful is if
your opponent is at a medium range or less, and you KNOW they will either
tag recover off the ground or backroll, but you won't get many skilled
players doing that. Or maybe at a certain range and they tag recklessly
this might be able to hit in time, but you'd have to hit like before they
come on screen otherwise they could tag cancel and this has bad recovery.

f+1+4:

A pretty good ram-type attack, as it does good damage, has good range, and
when blocked, you are at a frame disadvantage (-1), but can usually hit with
a d+1 or maybe a 1, depending on what the opponent will do. Try not to do
too often otherwise they'll be blocking it more and characters with 8 frame
jabs will probably smack you around before you can react. This can be easily
anticipated and at close range you're likely to be interrupted, and, it can
be easily sidestepped (if timed right). And yeah, same thing about the f,f+4
applies for this: don't overestimate the range cos it's only *active* during
the middle part and after that he runs for quite a bit while being totally
and utterly vunerable. Personally, I think there are more effective moves to
use, but don't be afraid to throw this out now and then (some players react
badly and try to hit you at the wrong time and get knocked over) as once it
has started up, it has pretty good priority, due to its fast foward motion.
Oh, and if you get blocked and you notice your opponent whacking madly at
the punch buttons or going for a throw, you could try b+1+2 cos you recover
at nearly the same time and so it should be sorta easy to get, but if you
screw up, well... Anyway, this can be good against reversal-happy players
as it is irreversable except against Anna (don't you just love seeing the
other guy wave his hands around trying to grab the air only to be barge
over by a big green hulk [ahhaha, funny, and I didn't even plan that :P],
or a big blue snow beast thing).

This is totally worthless, nothing good about it (just because I say so,
doesn't mean that's the be all and end all. You don't have to take my advice
on it [it's not good to comdemn a move just cos it's what you think], so go
try it out yourself, then tell me what you think - though I HIGHLY doubt your
opinion will differ far from mine, but still, people will get up me if I
condemn moves and stuff :P but then again, maybe not. If I went around saying
the Mishima 1,2,2 was the crappiest move I'd prolly get mass support, or
maybe opposed by those who joke about the 1,2,2 being any good...). Although
it may be his most powerful single-hitting non-unblockable move AFAIK (and as
far as the movelist goes), it ain't worth it. This has very bad tendency of
missing (hell, it can hardly hit normal people like Jin! I think you have to
be about a dash away [that's not including the dash he takes to do the move])
and even then it still screws up a lot, you can be knocked out of it very
easily, it can be ducked, if you miss you are screwed (it takes a very long
time for him to be able to get off the ground, meaning he will lie there a
bit and THEN you can do something to get up) and even if they blocked they
will most likely still have enough time to get in some hits while you lie
on the ground. Pathetic move, not even useful against scrubs apart from the
fact that it will probably hit like any other move used against a scrub
(no wait, this probably won't even hit even against a scrub because it
nearly always misses), but it still won't be much use. Just standing 4 them
to death ffs :D

A useful move, but don't use against standing opponents, only for okizeme
purposes. Well, you could if they have bad anticipation. Against a standing
opponent, you hafta be pretty far away to not be hit out of it, and it can be
seen coming pretty easily and blocked, leaving you lying at their feet. 
If you hit with this, and go under to the other side, press 3 to get up as it
is NEARLY guaranteed (rare cases where a ankle kick beats it). Also, this
would prolly hit a tagging in opponent, provided they don't hold DF as they
come in and lowparry it.

Pretty good move as it often catches people who like to block a lot by
suprise. Most will block it, think they are ok and then get *crunched* or
something equivalent. However, the "better" opponents will sidestep escape
it and the "even better" opponents will backdash escape and EWGF you...
A good thing is it hits mid though, and if you hit with the first hit the
second can't be escaped. Don't use this at close range as it's sort of slow
to come out and you most likely will be interrupted, best to use at dashing
range about. As mentioned before, this can be escaped by a sidestep-stagger
type way (u,N_d,N - essentially the same way as a normal sidestep) or a
backdash (b,b...) which is better as they recovery is A LOT quicker. At the
least, this move is irreversable so is pretty good against reversal-happy-
should-be-shot-players. Mix in with custom strings to catch the opponent by
suprise. Handy move, but DON'T get carried away (especially against good
players who will probably escape it).

This tracks pretty well, does good damage, good range but its start up and
recovery are a bit slow. In any case this move is pretty good, especially
against people who sit (stand?) there and try to block it. Try to avoid using
this too close because of its slow wind up (though make sure you won't
whiff!). Also, this is good to mix in with poking as you'll force your
opponent into blocking and just when they're thinking they're safe by
blocking, POW! d+3 is guaranteed after... (pathetic compared to True Ogre's
guaranteed d+3+4...)

Kind of the same as above, and although equal rating, I use this more as it's
quicker (especially if you get the f,f,N motion out quick, and the f,f,N
motion also means you can delay it as well), but I think apart from the dash,
its range isn't as good (he kinda uses his elbow instead of hand and I have
the tendency to overestimate and miss by an inch). This for some reason only
tracks to the left in TTT now, prolly to make it less effective (LIKE ALL HIS
BLOODY OTHER MOVES!!!), but I dunno about the b+2, so that might be better in
some situations IF (IF that is, cos I'm not sure) it tracks to the right, the
situations being against techrolling opponents.

I never use this move anymore (only used it when I was learning Ogre's moves
and didn't know any many other unblockables apart from b+2 and f,f,N+2. Mainly
because I hadn't bothered printing out his movelist and was using the one
built into the game). Pretty slow windup, but its quick after that and tracks
well. In addition, it has suprising range. It's damage is pretty poor though
considering its slow windup. However, if you throw it out maybe once if fifty
or so matches (although I wouldn't even bother using is THAT much :P in fact,
I don't even use it at all anymore) you might be able to get a "deer in the
headlights" (or is it kangaroo seeing as I'm in Australia?) reaction out of
the opponent, and if they try and back away it can still hit as after the
slow wind up he goes really fast and really far (though I'd much rather do
b+2+3 which is even faster and ever further...). Otherwise, this is pov.

3 because IF you use either of this unblockable or the one above, use this
one. This is very easy to see coming, and against anyone who's smart enough
can easily avoid it and punish you (for one, they can run under you and
backthrow you... provided they don't run under just a little and you spin
around and smack em a good one ehheeh). This can also be useful against those
who like to lie on the ground (and not roll sideways) and don't know what to
do when they see you coming (but that won't happen too much). Can also be
used against some people after a juggle (if at the right range). The hop
version once again doesn't serve much purpose except maybe range and to
confuse the opponent - "Why is this Ogre guy so stupid?". Overall, this move
is pretty bad (easy to see coming, tracking is nonexistent, and these two
factors put together mean that it will be sidestepped a lot [not to mention
you can just dash either way and it'll prolly miss]), but it has SOME uses,
like hitting a tagging in opponent or something like that.

This is pretty good, even against the intermediate player. Use from between
1.5 and 2 dash distance, and especially against techrollers (who otherwise
aren't too bright). Ogre moves back a bit as well, which is pretty good, hmmm,
this kinda reminds me of Julia's f+1+4, cos they both move back a bit, have
about the same wind up, rush foward quickly, track about to the same degree
and damage is about the same, 'cept Ogre's doesn't juggle (but sends em
rolling on CH :D). Either way, I use them in much the same situation (usually
when an opponent is recovering from something like a techroll, sideroll, long
recovery move etc.). Anyway, pretty good, throw out to catch opponent off
guard but don't overuse, otherwise you'll get punished (best bet is against
a techroll-happy opponent).

      Rating: 10 (if it took half the time to initiate, but it doesn't, so 3)
Haven't landed this so far, well, maybe once on the PS2 against my friends
who don't play, but that's prolly bout it. It just goes to show how slow this
is, easy to avoid, and povo range (not to mention the b,b slows the initiation
even more and effectively shortens the range). Only use against the worst of
players (and most of the time only for a crowd pleaser) and even then, try to
set it up (like anticipate their attack, then do it, making sure you won't get
hit eg. they are Paul and are obviously crap. They will almost certainly do a
deathfist, do the backdash as far as you can and then press 1+2 to do the
unblockable. They do the deathfist, they totally miss cos they are a pathetic
scrub who does deathfists hoping you will walk into it. Consequent of the
deathfist, they move RIIIIGGGGHHHHHTTTT up to you, Ogre finishes winding up
and whacks them a good 100 points of damage. Hooray, instant win!). BTW, you
can barely set this up anyway because of its REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, *deep breath*, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY SLOW wind up,
and so even if you know they will techroll and you do the move, they will
most likely not only have time to techroll, but to move back, and if Kuma, do
the 1+3+4... and let it finish before you have recovered. Well, maybe not, but
enough time to get away, interrupt etc. :)

I would use this whenever I could, against high attacks that is, but the
timing is very hard. You'll have to anticipate your opponent's attack. This
would have a higher rating but it's hard to get to work, and if you try doing
it too much you're just gonna get hit. If you can get it the majority of the
time, then the use rating pretty much works right, but if you can't, don't try
using too much (maybe 3-5/10. But against computer feel free to practice).

***********************
*  4) CUSTOM STRINGS  *
***********************

Yeah ummm, you should know what custom strings are... in short, I guess
they're best defined as a bunch of moves strung together to give the opponent
little time to interrupt and put pressure on him, usually to get an opening
and juggle the opponent or do some major damage.

Against good opponents, you shouldn't continue if they block the df+1, but
against scrubs and maybe intermediates and stuff, go ahead (sometimes, just
figure if they will try to interrupt or not). And BTW, these have many moves
or combinations of moves in common, so you can really link these all over
the place and go on forever (the obvious ones are pointed out with the [...],
but the infinity kicks one isn't advisable, just there cos you can if you
want. Or just playing a scrub...) - PITBULL DAMMIT! - but if they block
certain moves it's risky to go on, like the df+1 as mentioned before, and
1,1 or 1,2 jabs as well, cos if blocked it leaves you at at a disadvantage
of -6 frames. But if they aren't smart, panic and don't interrupt and stay
blocking (or get hit trying to do a slow move), feel free to go on.

Note:
1)These can be started with (1,1)_(1,2) but this may affect some hits. Some
may miss or hit if not before. eg. d+1 does not always hit, however, this can
be replaced with d+2 which has more range and damage, but is slower.

[1,1_2], df+1, d+1, [FC+4], FC+3,3,d+3, WS+3,3,d+3,3,[3...]

-Analysis-

[1,1_2], df+1, d+1, [FC+4], WS+2
Your standard custom combo. If you know they will block the WS+2, add in the
FC+4, then do WS+2 if they expect another low attack. If you hit with the WS+2
on clean hit, do a Waning Moon. If hit normally and you are close enough, do a
Waning Moon. If they block, your best bet is a d+1, then do whatever from
there. Anyway, don't use the WS+2 too often cos it's quite slow in TTT and bad
recovery...

[1,1_2], df+1, d+1, [FC+4], WS+3,3,d+3,3,[3...]
Very good if they expect a low attack after d+1, cos the first 4 or 5 hits of
the infinite kicks will do some good damage. If they block you should fairly
safe, though you'll be -16 frames disadvantaged. 
You should really only do the first 4 most of the time, only do More if you
are sure your opponent will get hammered. Also, if the d+1 connects, the
infinity kicks (first 4) should be guaranteed (damn cheap, but so are a lot
of other things (and Ogre needs as much help as he can get anyway, SO THERE!
Call me cheap and I'll WS+2,4 ya! :P)

[1,1_2], df+1, d+1, [FC+4], FC,f+1
This is ok to use, but the FC,f+1 comes out sorta slow, so the main point of
using this is to fake out your opponent (try fool him into attacking and then
he gets hit). If the last hit connects, they will crumple and you get them
with some okizeme.

[1,1_2], df+1, d+1, [FC+4], FC,f+2
Nice and damaging, but they will have the advantage on you if you hit on
anything but a counter hit with the FC,f+2. Mix up and delay and stuff to
catch them on counter hit. Not tooooo advisable due to bad recovery 'cept
on CH in which case the opponent crumples (but a CH is hard to land with this
because of its slow windup).

[1,1_2], df+1, d+1, [FC+4], FC,df+2
If you connect with the FC,df+2, it will lead up for some nice guaranteed
damage, namely from the f,f+1+2. Mix up with other stuff because if they block
the FC,df+2 you will be at a HUGE disadvantage, due to very poor recovery. 
Do a lot of WS+2 so that they get used to blocking standing up, then throw
this in now and then.

[1,1_2], df+1, d+1, [FC+4], FC+3,3,(d+3)_(N+3)
Good for when they expect a mid/high attack. Once again, mix up to confuse
them. Also mix up the d+3 and N+3 ender, most people will get hit by the d+3
rather than taking the chance of eating the N+3. If they do start to block 
low, throw in the N+3. However, if the d+3 is blocked, you will be slower to
recovery, whereas if you do the N+3, if it hits, bloody good, if they block
it, they get knocked back anyway.

[1,1_2], df+1, (1+3)_(2+4)_(df,DF+2+4)
Good to throw (haha) in when they are expecting you to do a d+1 or 1,1 as they
won't be ready to break, especially if its the Waning Moon. Use now and then
to throw (WAHAHA) them off.

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, (1+3)_(2+4)_(df,DF+2+4)
Another way of mixing up the throwing. If they are getting wise to you
throwing right after df+1, use the 1,1_2 now and then and then throw them.
This will probably create a sort of a guessing game. And then you can throw in
a b+2 unblockable to piss 'em off.

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, df+1[...]
A sort of infinite mix up, you can start your custom strings all over again,
though I think they will be pushed away eventually. But anyway, if you mix
this stuff up with low attacks, and then they get hit by df+1, then, as Renick
would say, "It puts you in range by impact, and a d+1 is guaranteed
afterward.", and then you can link up other custom strings.

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, df+1,2
Same as above but ends with a 2 instead of continuing. If you hit it adds some
more damage too. Keeps the pressure on the opponent and maybe even makes them
panic more as you usually only do a single df+1, and possibly making them
freeze long enough to let you do another custom string or something.

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, df+2
Pretty much same use as the df+1, but if you hit with this you can run in with
some other moves as they stagger back. Some people say uf+3,4,3 but I don't
think that's in range, unless you move foward a bit. A f,f+4 works well,
unless they're smart enough to avoid it in the many ways it can be, but if
they block they stagger, leading up to another guessing game (d+1 - leads up
to yet MORE guessing/df,DF+2+4/1,1,2) or it'll just plain hit the dumbass
right in the face :P.

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, df+4
A nice and quick kick at the end of it will dish out decent damage if they
crouch, or if they block it'll knock them away, leaving you at square one
again, but you'll be building up a psychological edge all the way as long as
you keep them on defense.

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, f+2
Has a sort of delay in the pace of things, adds to confusion yet again, they
try to strike and get hit with a powerful f+2. Good to use now and then, just
as long as they don't try to interrupt (and make sure to chicken buffer!)

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, b+2
Another nice thing to throw in, hoping that the opponent will stay blocking.

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, f,f,N+2
Same as above, but I think it is a tad quicker, provided you do the f,f,N
quickly. Though if opponents see you doing a f,f in, they might try to
retaliate.

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, d+4,[4]
It's good to mix up the hit ranges now and then. Throw this in if they just
stand there and block.

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, uf+4
If you think they might try to retaliate, as long as not with a quick move
(maybe with a throw this oughta work), do this to do a juggle, adding to the
damage as well as psychological damage (after blocking a lot and trying to
fight back, only to get juggled for some unavoidable damage would get on 
your nerves wouldn't it?).

[1,1_2], df+1, 1,1_2, f,f+2
Same principle as the b+2 or f,f,N+2 ending strings, and slightly quicker as
well (though escapable, but 1) If you hit it can't be escaped anyway 2) Many
people don't know the escapes 3) Even people who do know the escapes might
not react it time, as you are pitbulling them with custom strings and all,
and then you throw this out. Of course, against better ppl I wouldn't try
too much... MIX IT UP DAMMIT AND YOU JUST MIGHT GET IT TO WORK =P).

All the rest (from the third set) are really just variations of the second 
set, apart from my special.

BLCSTSDSM - Big Long Custom String That Should Destory Scrubs Maybe
[1,1_2], df+1, d+1, FC+3,3,d+3, WS+3,3,d+3,3,[3...]
This works especially well against scrubs and even works on some
intermediates. Most people would rather stand after the snake kicks to eat the
d+3 rather than get hit by a d+3 (however, the better ppl can tell the
difference between the end... I myself, an average player, can tell the
difference!), and as for scrubs, well, they don't know how to duck and
block... After the d+3 (provdided it connects, if it doesn't, it's pretty
risky continuing), you will be at -3 frame disadvantage, and the infinite
kicks take 10 frames to start up. Therefore, they opponent has 13 frames to
stop you (pretty risky, but it should destroy scrubs maybe =P), so unless they
jab or use a quick attack, you will get the infinite kicks started and
hopefully they will be dumb enough to get hit by the the first few infinite
kicks =P Massive damage from just those 4 hits (or 3, depending which way you
did the infinite kicks), INSANE DAMAGE if you hit the scrubby bastard with the
whole string (over 120 damage I think).

Ok I haven't listed all of Ogre's juggles known and all, I just put in the
most handy and powerful and stuff. Some of the techable juggles that aren't
as strong as the other techable juggles have been included as they still do
good damage and aren't as "noticeably techable", and some of them have tech-
baiting properties (more later). Techable (or escapable in some form) combos
have been marked. I've also added some juggles from Catlord's Combo
Compendium that are pretty good and he sez are guaranteed so I'll take his
word for it. BTW, some juggles have variations of 4 or df+1,4 cos I'm not
sure what does more damage in TTT (cos the move lists don't tell damage for
standing 4 as it ain't a technique), but I think doing the df+1 first is
better, but a 4 still does a crapload of damage, and it's a lot easier (not
that doing df+1,4 is that hard, but anyway).

Note: Juggles that can be teched (or escaped) are marked with a <T>. Also,
d,db+4(CH) juggles can be done after a tooth fairy (ub+3,2) as well (which
is a gay move anyway hehehe).

WS+2(Clean), 4 (>:D This is just plain EVIL)
WS+2(Clean), 2,2 (nearly as much damage as 4, but this will leave them
	standing for some pitbulling, guessing games, whatever. You'll also
	have +2 frame advantage. Pretty much here just for variety and
	mixing up)
WS+2(Clean), uf+3,4,[3] (if you leave off the last 3, you'll have a
	guessing game going. I say to stay in FC, if they flinch, to a
	FC,df+2 or FC,f+2. If they tech, wait a bit [so the moves will track
	properly] and then do the above mentioned moves)

Note: Above aren't necessarily guaranteed due to stun escape blah blah...

[WS+2], uf+4, df+1, 4
[WS+2], uf+4, df+1, FC+3,3,N+3[~5] (IMO this should be your basic combo)

	least I had the fun of discovering it myself. If you do the second FC
	quick enough [ie. using a quick methed, like holding DF for a bit,
	then hitting 2] this will connect, and I'm pretty sure it's

********************
*  7) WANING MOON  *
********************

Waning Moon is probably one of the best throws in the game, definitely Ogre's
best throw, and can lead up to some damaging followups. Good ways of setting
it up are listed below (buffer Waning Moon where possible, which is most of
the time, the reason why the following are good ways of setting it up):

-Setting Up-

Key:
WM = Waning Moon (df,DF+2+4)
B = Blocked
* = Preferably. You can still do it on a normal hit, but not guaranteed (well,
TECHNICALLY it isn't guaranteed on clean hit as you can tag out of the stun).

1,1_2,WM
WS+2(Clean*),WM
WS+4,WM
f,f+4(B),WM
uf+3,4(B),WM
df+1,WM - The "HAN special"
After universal low parry (d/f), WM
Opponent suffers guard stun (eg. After blocked (WR)1+2)
Opponent misses attack, WM
Block attack w/ long recovery, WM

-Finishing Off-

Here are some descriptions of methods of finishing off the Waning Moon (BTW,
if you *think* you know what your opponent will do, or he does the same thing
over and over, use the best move for that situation, desipte the ratings I've
given...):

*F1*
(Run in)f+2
      Waning-Moon-Use Rating: 9
The most reliable followup after Waning Moon. This will hit standing or
crouching opponents, has good range, avoids some high attacks (BTW, when
someone is BK and they attack, in most cases, that attack is high) I think,
although they shouldn't have time to attack anyway, pretty sure it's
unescapable. VERY easy to perform, so if you screw this up other than
EXTREMELY rarely, you are crap... VERY crap indeed =P

*F2*
(WR)3
      Waning-Moon-Use Rating: 8
Easy and damaging, essentially the same as f+2, forgot which does more
damage though.

*F3*
(Run in)uf+3,4,3
      Waning-Moon-Use Rating: 8
Good range and damage. Pretty much the same properties as doing f+3 this
starts with essentially the same type of move. Very fancy looking and all,
and I think more damage than the above as well.

*F4*
(Run in)d,db+4~5, f,f,N+1+2
      Waning-Moon-Use Rating: 8
Douzono's combo. Castel also had this in his True Ogre Act 1 vid, but I think
he did the d~db+4 a tad late (Kazuya's head turned around, therefore he would
be able to do stuff, maybe. Whater =P). Anyway, pretty good to do, and fancy
as well. I've heard that the tag dive doesn't always hit either but a good
followup nonetheless.

*F5*
(Run in)1+3_2+4
      Waning-Moon-Use Rating: 6-8 - Depends on opponent, how quick you are 
	and situation (eg. if they only have a bit of damage left, there isn't
      much point trying to land this)
Hard to get but VERY damaging. You have to be quick to pull this one off.
Remember, Ogre has good reach with throws, so you don't have to be right up 
to them to grab them. If you can perfect the timing of this, it can be hard
to avoid (I think if your quick enough, and the opponent tries to turn
around, you can still get the backthrow. Not sure, oh well).

*F6*
f,f+4, d+4,4
	Waning-Moon-Use Rating: 8-9
Castel had this in Ogre Combo Act 1 (I had already tried f,f+4 but it could
be screwed up if mistimed pretty easily and seeing as I didn't think about
doing a d+4,4 after for more damage, I didn't think it was worthwhile). This
is quite damaging and guaranteed I'm pretty sure. Just make sure you don't
whiff (look stupid, hurt bad). The way I figure the timing for this is to get
a little foward motion from the f,f. Too much will give the opponent time to
react, too little will make you fall short.

Here's a little chart that will show what's best to do in a nutshell (of
course this isn't the be all and end all of what to do, this is just my
opinion of what to do eg. I don't think F6 would be wise to use if they
crouch all the time in case you don't do it quick enough and you will
totally and utterly miss):

Key:
A = Opponent is defensive (ie. holds back to turn around)
B = Opponent crouches
C = Opponent is slow and/or you are VERY quick

               +--A--|ANY|

****************
*  8) OKIZEME  *
****************

Ogre's okizeme is one of the best in the game, and it's bloody fun to kick an
opponents ass while he's still on the ground, especially if he doesn't know
how to get up (I once took nearly half a life bar off a guy on okizeme alone,
though I'm sure there's a lot of people who can do better. Though that was a
looooongggg time ago against some guy who wasn't too good, considering that
was the time very soon after I was getting over tenstrings and all and I was
beating his ass down...). I think that it is very important that an Ogre
player is good with okizeme as well as juggles and stuff. The key is
anticipation, if you know what your opponent is going to do to get up, you
can keep him on the ground for a long time... (against scrubs at the very
least, sometimes indefinitely, rolling backwards is so easy to punish :P)

-Setting Up-

These are listed in order of what I consider the best setups to "worst"
(doesn't mean they aren't good) setups, I have also made another list for
setting up the f,f,N mixup (see later):

*Standard Okizeme*            *f,f,N mixup*
Juggles                       Juggles
Basic Throws                  1,1>2
b+2                           f+2
f,f,N+2
1,1>2
f+2
SS+4
f,f,N+3+4
f+1+4

-Unorthodox Methods of Setting Up-

These setups are moves that should be followed up with okizeme but shouldn't
be used to actually set up okizeme. Therefore, if you hit with a f,f+3, you
can follow up with okizeme but don't try landing a f,f+3 just to set okizeme
up (in fact, you should practically almost NEVER use f,f+3 in the first place,
unless in some sort of situation where its the best option, but when will that
happen? And if it has, I would like to know). These are also in order as
above:

*Standard Okizeme*            *f,f,N mixup*
FC,f+1                        f,f,N+4 (Whether they are standing or grounded)
FC,f+2(CH)                    4
f,f+3                         d,db+4
                              uf+3,4,3
                              b+2+3					
                              f,f+1+2

-Okizeme Tools-

Here is a brief (or not) outline on Ogre's okizeme tools (BTW, if you *think*
you know what your opponent will do, or he does the same thing over and over,
use the best move for that situation, desipte the ratings I've given... hmmm,
sounds familiar, but it still applies for okizeme, moreso that is):

d+3
     Okizeme-Use Rating: 8
Your good ol' all purpose oki-tool. Use on an opponent at your feet who
doesn't get up (can be used instead of the d+4,4 so you don't get
predictable), because other moves are too slow to wind up at close range
(eg. f,f,N+4) which would give them time to get up and hit you, unless you're
quick. This is most likely a move that should be used at lot when the opponent
is at your feet, also cos its safe and practically guaranteed, but I
personally prefer going for more damage, like using stuff like the f,f,N+4,
which has a little risk. So if you want to get in that extra *little* damage
and be safe, use this.

FC+3,3,d+3_N+3
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 7
In the event that your opponent is at your feet and stays down long enough
not to get hit by d+4,4 but not long enough to get hit by a f,f+1+2 or
something similar, you can use this to the same effect as the Heihachi's
hellsweeps (first hit will knock away if they stay down, if they roll away
all three will hit, if you use the N+3 ender). I only use the d+3 version
when I miss the first and subsequently the second, to chase them down, and
the third generally hits, though it really depends on situation. This
situation usually happens against side/techrollers. Once again, depending on
situation, you should only do two as they often get hit too far away and the
recovery of the third kick will leave you open to attack after they get up.

d+4,4
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 7
Best used when your opponent is at your feet (eg. after 2+4 throw it is very
effective if opponent tries to do something) and you anticipate that they will
get up in one way or another. This is because as soon as they flinch (even
with an ankle kick) the low kick will hit them, and then so will the high
kick. This will also knock them to nice distance perfect for more okizeme.
However, don't get predictable against a smart opponent else they will just
lie there, your kicks will miss and you will probably get hit while
recovering. Of course, you could go with the single d+4 but the recovery is
still slow enough to get hit anyway. Anyway, if your opponent always tries to
get up straight away, use this with gay abandon (don't misinterpret that heh).

4~3
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 4
Nice damage, bad recovery, which doesn't matter much if you hit, IF. This
goes in a straight line, so use against people at your feet who roll back or
who are roughly at flipkicks range and stay down just that litte bit longer.
This is good ONLY against people who don't know that Tekken is a 3D game and
play it like street fighter ie. they don't techroll, sideroll etc. However,
even if they do know, but they are a player who likes to sit there until you
hit them, you can do this and prolly hit, but after a while (say, once...)
they'll probably catch on, and also, the range at which this hits would be
far enough away that they prolly won't lie there cos it'll be a safe
distance (of course is they try to get up you can always go for a f,f,N+2_4
depending on how they get up. Maybe even f,f,N+3+4). In any case, f,f,N+4
is prolly a better option, but you can use this now and then if you KNOW
(ie. ABSOLUTELY, POSTIVELY SURE) it will hit, cos you are screwed if you
miss. Oh btw, although not REALLY okizeme, against those handstanding
Eddy's, this works great =D (but so does f,f,N+4 =P).

SS+4
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 7.5
This could have some nice little effects in okizeme. For one, say if the
opponent is close to you, you could SS to throw them off and trick them into
flinching and then you hit 4 and hit them (if they stood up, you'll trip em
if timed right, and then some nice juggles can be done), if they stay there,
this will hit anyway as it hits grounded opponents, AND it does a nice damage
of 22.

d,db+4
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 6.5
I don't really use this, but it can be used when the opponent gets up but
you'll prolly hafta anticipate, else it might not hit in time, and whiffing
is bad :(. But, if it does hit, it'll do some nice damage (30), but I prefer
doing stuff like good ol' f,f,N+4 which will do 20 damage, not so bad, and a
lot safer. Besides, this will probably only hit foward/backrollers or crouch
recoverers (is that a word?) as it dun track.

FC,f+2
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 7
This is an alright move, good damage, speed and range, though poor recovery,
you can go into crouch position as soon as you knock the opponent over, and
wait for him to flinch. However, I wouldn't recommend against tech/siderollers
as this doesn't track all that well, and you'll get whacked if you miss
because of its recovery time (hell, even when you hit a standing opponent with
this, they recover faster than you! Unless on counterhit, in which case they
crumple), BUT, if you wait till when they've nearly finished techrolling, I
think it will hit (though which side they roll may also affect the result).
If only Ogre could be more like True Ogre with his super long righty...

FC,df+2
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 7
Average, might as well use FC,f+2 as it does more damage and for some reason
hits better (I think because of the way he arcs his arm differently, and I
think it has more range). However, this is good if you opponent stands or
sometimes against one that techrolls, as just as they stands, you whip this
out and then will get a guaranteed f,f+1+2 after (which isn't as damaging
in TTT and there are prolly better followups, like FC+3,3,N+3 which
requires quicker timing I think but methinks does more damage and is
taggable), unless they crouch recover, in which case you are more or less
screwed, unless they are absolutely stupid. BTW, if your opponent doesn't move
for sometime you can use this for some alright damage, but there are better
options. This SOMETIMES hits grounded but not on a regular (and thus reliable)
basis. Thie move has the same deal with True Ogre owning Ogre's ass in all
departments 'cept for stumpy legs and a tankass...

f,f+1+2
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 7.5
Make sure your opponent isn't going to techroll or roll sideways cos this
doesn't track for shit and you will be absolutely screwed if you miss, cos
your opponent will most likely be at your side and it'll be lights out for
you. But if your opponent loves to stay on the ground (I'll usually just
f,f,N+4 them over and over, and then f,f,N+3+4 when they get away, cos I
always forget to use this except as a juggle ender, although FC+3,3,N+3
does such a great job as an ender anywayz), go for this and then they'll
be sorry =D (just be sure you'll hit).

f+1+4
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 5.5
This isn't that bad, but not that good, cos if you miss, you'll probably be
backturned and they could very possibly get in a backthrow, which can't be
good for your health. Use this if you anticipate the opponent will stand or
backroll, and make sure they aren't too far away (in which case you should go
for f,f,N+3+4) or you'll just be doing them a favour by running up to them to
be beaten around.

f,f,N+4
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 9
Kick ass move! Good for running down opponents over and over. Very effective
against people who stay on the ground, backroll, recover crouching and even
standing (If you got carried away and they get up right into it). However, if
they techroll you're screwed... BUT if you actually anticipate and do the
f,f,N motion and wait to see what they do, which is very effective as the 2,4
or 3+4 can be delayed quite a bit (even when you've stopped moving they'll
still come out), and delay the 4 enough you can actually hit techrollers.
If you do miss with this move its recovery is good enough that most of the
time you should be fairly safe. Anyways, this move is a very reliable okizeme
tool, just make sure you use it properly...

f,f,N+3+4
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 8
Another good move, mostly used for chasing down an opponent tagging out,
backrolling or a fair distance away. I usually use this after multiple
f,f,N+4's knock the opponent too far away :). Again, watch for techrollers
and siderollers, as this will miss quite easily. When you miss you at least
slide a fair bit away from your opponent, and if you're lucky, and your
opponent is dumb and slow, you can recover without them performing okizeme
on you :P.

f,f,N+2
      Okizeme-Use Rating: 8
Not really an okizeme tool, but can be used for opponents getting back up. Use
against people who recover standing or crouching (it hits mid), techrollers to
Ogre's left and sometimes backrollers if you're quick (if your using the f,f,N
mixup it shouldn't be too much of a problem).

-The f,f,N mixup-

Righteo, this is a certain "trick" used in okizeme to hit the opponent no
matter what they do. Sounds like it's foolproof, but it isn't. Nonetheless
it's bloody effective. BTW, I got this from Renick's FAQ who got it from
Sauer Krauts T3 FAQ, so credit to both, though I adapted it a little for
my style.

What this mixup uses is the following moves:
f,f,N+2
f,f,N+4
f,f,N+3+4

To set it up, do the f,f,N motion as soon as you knockdown your opponent
(including after juggles). If the opponent gets up standing or crouching
(or techrolls left - move won't track right), you hit 2. If they stay
down or recover crouching (and sorta when they tech, it doesn't always
hit), hit 4. If they roll back (or foward...) and even if they stay on
ground (though I dun advise), or if they are too far away for anything
else, hit 3+4. In a nutshell:

Key:
A = Opponent recovers standing, crouching, or techrolls left.
B = Opponent recovers crouching, stays grounded, or techrolls.
C = Opponent foward/backrolls, or stays grounded.

                +--A--|f,f,N+2|
                |
                |

                |
                +--C--|f,f,N+3+4|

-When To Do What-

I think that the most important part of okizeme is knowing what to do when
(but if you can stop them from ever getting up again until you kill them,
that's just fine...). I've pretty much covered it in the descriptions but I'll
do it in a nice orderly fashion here. Here's what I think:

*Opponent Recovers Standing*

-Close Range: If they're gonna try and stand, just d+4,4 them, in fact, d+4,4
works whenever they try to do something at your feet. However, if you did not
anticipate this, you can still do it if you want, but just throw them maybe
(this is not really okizeme but it'll ground 'em again), Waning Moon
preferably. I reckon go for b+2 or f,f,N+2 (I think might be quicker if you
can do it quick enough). Just do what you think is the best for the situation.

-Medium Range: I'd say the best options here would be f,f,N+2 (works like a
charm), FC,f+2 to some extent and definitely FC,df+2. You can try a f+1+4 but
not really that good an option. f,f,N+4 works pretty good as well.

-Long Range: Best option here is the f,f,N+3+4. The f,f,N+4 might work,
depending on the situation.

*Opponent Recovers Crouching*

-Close Range: A good option is the uf+4 hopkick for a free juggle.
Alternatively you could go for a df+4 or some other relatively fast mid move.
A f,f,N+4 will work if you're quick, but not as effective at close range.

-Medium Range: Definitely f,f,N+4. 4~3 SHOULD work, though rather risky. f+1+4
works better here than at close range, and other than getting lucky and
interrupting you, the best they can do is stand and block (though not the best
option anyway). Once again f,f,N+2 kicks ass.

-Long Range: Not much option here, cos f,f,N+3+4 will be blocked, leaving you,
hmmm, screwed. Maybe a uf+1+2, but this takes long enough to let them react
and either interrupt or stand and block. If you delay the f,f,N+4 enough to
get as much range as possible, it might still work.

*Opponent Stays Grounded*

-Close Range: You can do d+3, which is nice and safe and dandy and all, but
rather low on the damage. If they are just staying grounded in front of you
it's probably because they are either waiting for you to whiff to give them
a chance to get up or knock them away. You might wanna try a f,f+1+2 for
some nice damage, though I wouldn't do too often, as they'll catch on and
interrupt with a kick recover of some form probably. You can also do a
f,f,N+4 (double tap REALLY quick then release) and it'll come out quick
enough, a nice safe option. After this you can go for the f,f,N mixup. BTW,
after you knock them away with a f,f,N+4 most ppl will take that as their
chance to get up after being knocked away so usually a f,f,N+2 will be a
very good followup and put them back on the ground.

-Medium Range: The 4~3 and f,f,1+2 still work well, but they are rather
risky. f,f,N+4 is probably the best option, also, a f,f,N+3+4 should work
too but you might as well do a f,f,N+4.

-Long Range: Probably the f,f,N+3+4. Once again f,f,N+4 for same reason.
If you're feeling real lucky you could try a uf+1+2~D, but I wouldn't
advise trying this very often.

*Opponent Rolls Back (or forward if they are crazy...)*

-Close Range: Doing d+4,4 is easy and good enough, and also puts them at
an ideal range for more okizeme. Other decent options would be to do a
f,f+1+2 or f,f,N+4. A 4~3 is ok as well, just make sure you don't flip
OVER them... both the FC,df+2 and FC,f+2 work well too.

-Medium Range: Ideal range and situation for okizeme. You can go for f,f+1+2,
a FC,f+2 works and sometimes FC,df+2 (I wouldn't use this much, it has a
tendency to screw up). But these three might whiff if they roll back and you
mistime them. I recommend going for a f,f,N+4 as it is quick, damaging
enough and puts them back on the ground at your feet, usually leaving the
opponent at a good range for other okizeme techniques (or another f,f,N+4).

-Long Range: Once again, the f,f,N+3+4 is probably the only thing you can
do. If they aren't too far away, you can go for the uf+1+2 (great damage)
but once again will most likely only work on scrubs, but then again, not
many others roll back now do they? And if they are rolling back, they can't
go sideways so this should hit. Therefore, this works whenever someone
backrolls (provided you aren't a tool and miss). f,f,N+4, same reason, but
this time, as they are rolling back, they might be too far away for this.

*Opponent Techrolls*

-Close Range: Hmmm, b+2 (or f,f,N+2) should work. Problem with f,f,N+2 is
that is doesn't track to the right anymore, and you really begin to see
the difference when they tech to your right and sidethrow you or
something... Doing a uf+4 hopkick is ok if you time it well. You might
want to try throwing them as well.

-Medium Range: The f,f,N+2 is very effective here except for the fact
that it doesn't track to the right. I've found that doing f,f,N+4 and
delaying that 4 a bit will track a fairly well and still hit. You can also
use b+2 instead of f,f,N+2 but the range is less (you'll have to dash in
first) and it's slower, so prolly stick with f,f,N+2.

-Long Range: Yes well, not much option here, as they are far away and by
the time most moves will close the range they will be standing again.
The f,f,N+3+4 could work if delayed but probably not too well.

*Opponent Tag Recovers*

-Close Range: Once again d+4,4 works quite well. Other stuff to do would be
the f,f,N+4 maybe, and possibly FC,f+2_df+2. You'll have to be quick though.
It's usually easy to anticipate a tag recover after you've just knocked them
down in one way or another and they only have a sliver of life left. uf+1+2
works too. Maybe even go for a b+2+3 or f,f+4 to hit the tagging in partner.
Depends really, you might even go for an uf+4 hopkick to juggle the partner.

-Medium Range: A f,f,N+3+4 should work. Same stuff as for close really except
the d+4,4.

-Long Range: Weeeellll, not much option here, f,f,N+3+4 is probably the best
thing to do, just make sure you you cover the distance... You could still
possibly hit with uf+1+2 and maybe go for b+2+3 or uf+1+2~D (to hit the
incoming partner).

******************
*  9) TAG STUFF  *
******************

Tag stuff. 'nuff said.

-When to tag-
Well, if you don't know, Ogre is pov with the whole concept of tagging, so its
important to know what to do so that you don't get Ogre or his partner's ass
kicked.
*Start with other charcter as Ogre most likely has worse tagging out abilities
*Netsu ain't gonna happen (would you wanna help a big green monster that kills
lots of people?)
*Tag as much as possible so that you can regenerate lost energy (just don't
tag in a weaker partner...) whenever it's safe, usually try and tag out the
character with the bigger red bar if it's safe, as you might not get another
safe oppurtunity for a while. If the other partner is near full and Ogre's
even only lost about 25% I'll still tag to let him heal (keeping your
characters' health as high as possible helps you win the round).
*Definitely tag when low on health, though make sure its safe to, cos no point
in tagging out a <50% character and tagging in 100% character if he gets hit
by a very damaging juggle or unblockable that'll leaving him with <30%
*Tag when opponent is incapacitated (apart from being KOed...), on the ground
or at a distance (sometimes).
*After juggles is a good time to tag (unless okizeme is a better option *EVIL
LAUGH*)
*Only "safe" tag launcher Ogre should tag off is FC+3,3,N+3 (a good idea is to
use the FC+3,3,N+3 as a juggle ender and tag of it [and then you can even tag
slide in for more damage])
*1+3 throw is also pretty good. Though it has the tendency to be escaped a lot
against Mishima's (1,1,2 jabs. Go figure)
*When you just got your assed whooped and are lying on the ground, don't
always use the tag recover, as it is slow to tag out easily punished. Use your
discretion.

-When they are tagging (provided they aren't being careful)-
*Hit them with a powerful move eg. Standing 4 (WAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA). Be
careful if they like to tag slide/crosschop (or deathfist...)
*Juggle them
*Unblockable (f,f+2/f,f,N+2/b+2/b+2+3)
*When you busted them up, either okizeme them or tag out yourself (if you
need/want to)

-Tag Partners-
Choose someone who is a different to Ogre (True Ogre is not BTW... he's
just plain badass way better than Ogre ehehehhe). Anyway:

-Ogre/Jin-
Heh, yes I know everyone uses Jin and all, but he is an alright match with
Ogre (apart from the fact [or assumption] that Ogre killed his mom...). He has
some nice juggles, a reversal (which doesn't count for too much but at your
local arcade it's ok sometimes... btw, can be useful when tagging in as the
tag cancel isn't always 100% reliable and much better to eat a chicken than
a 50% juggle...), and most of all: EWGF! Anyway, both have a decent poking
game, Jin lacks low attacks sorta, while Ogre has a fair few, Ogre has a bunch
of quick unblockables, Jin don't, Ogre pitbulls, Jin juggles etc etc. Anyway,
I reckon Jin and Ogre work pretty well (Jin's supposed to go well with anyone
anyway!).

-Ogre/Yoshimitsu-
I reckon this team works rather well together. Yoshi has great poking power,
good juggles, lots of all-round stuff, helps make up for Ogre's weaknesses.
Yoshi also has a stronger defense, and a bunch of tag launchers to make
tagging safer. Quite the opposite playing styles in my opinion (pitbull and
deceptive type stuff), prolly force your opponent to change tactics. Also,
they are both good with the sidestep game, Yoshi with a decent sidestep 
(and his b+3+4) and 3 moves to boot, and Ogre with his massive "get a
back throw when they miss a foward-moving-non-tracking move" sidestep.

Uhhh, too lazy to put any more teams... (btw, True Ogre I reckon will do heaps
better with Jin or Yoshi =D also cos he's waaaaayyy more powerful ehehhe)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**************************
*  10) PLAYING STRATEGY  *
**************************

Alright, I'm going to list some ways of playing Ogre and how to. These aren't
necessarily the only ways to play Ogre or how to, just how I perceive them to
be. Anyway, here they are:

-Pitbull (Full-bore Offensive)-
Best way to play Ogre. Never stop attacking, never let them attack! Attack,
ATTACK, ATTTTTTAAACCCKKK!!! Do lots of poking and quick moves like
1,1/1,2/df+1,[2]/df+4/d+2 and stuff like that. Mix up the hit ranges to keep
them guessing, and at the same time, sidetracked from attacking themselves.
Keep the pressure on them, and if they try to tag, charge in and either keep
bashing them around or take down the opponent before they have a chance to
react. One thing to remember though, do not get carried away or cocky and end
up getting hit everytime you try to charge in. Even though you are playing
aggressive, make sure your attacks are well planned and placed, think about
what you're gonna do next, making sure it has a good chance of working ie.
hitting, them blocking, pretty much you not getting hit. Make sure you chicken
buffer as any moves as possible (stuff like f+2... VERY EASY TO BUFFER A
CHICKEN). Make sure you don't overextend yourself thought with slow moves that
they can easily sidestep, once again, make sure the attack is well placed. If
they keep blocking, throw in a throw (WAHAHAHAHAHA, funny :P), or do an
unblockable like b+2 or f,f,N+2, and if the distance is right, maybe even a
b+2+3, but don't do too often as you will be backdashed, EWGFed, and juggled
to death. Anyway, don't get too crazy, cos a lot of his quicker moves are
still slower than other peoples, but he also has long limbs, so his range
should be used to compensate for his slowness. Play him at a moderate range
and try getting in counterhits and interrupt with stuff like 1,1,2/uf+4/d+1
for setting up FC, which can also be setup better at moderate range. In
short, make well planned and timed attacks and keep up the pressure.

-Turtle (Defensive)-
Now this is plain stupid. THIS IS PLAIN SUICIDAL!!! Ogre's defensive game is
pretty much pathetic compared to anyone else, which is why pitbulling is his
best playing style. However, if you SOMEHOW have mastered the timing of the
b+1+2 and can pull it off whenever, then you will be able to stay on the
defensive the whole match and kill your opponent at the same time - provided
they only attack high... But that is practically impossible to do (getting the
b+1+2 every time) anyway as the timing is very precise and you have to
anticipate when your opponent will attack. Of course, you could still play
like a normal turtle (the universal low parry helps a bit, but that's the only
other defensive measure you have) and wait for your opponent to screw up then
juggle him and stuff like that, though it's not advisable because as said
before, Ogre has a pathetic defensive game, and hit juggles aren't exactly the
most powerful in the first place, good, but not awesome. His best way of
dishing out da damage is by mixing up, with custom strings, most prominently,
powerful moves/combos of the FC, or just plain big hits (f+2,4... make sure to
chicken buffer). If you still insist on turtling, use d+1 a lot, but anymore
than that, well, you're on your own...

-Poker (Offensive/Defensive)-
Ogre has lots of good pokes and all, so you can sit there poking them a lot if
you want, but I still prefer pitbulling where his power really lies, and the
damage you can dish out. However, this still has its uses (especially against
scrubs), usually against aggressive players (but pitbulling is good against
them: The best defense is offense after all :) ie. if you're pitbulling them
they can't do it back). I advise staying a bit out of throw range, and just
poke them heaps so that they can't get in close. If they wiff or something,
go for a juggle or a power hit (depending on recovery time). In any case,
this is alright, but once again I would recommend pitbulling, as although
Ogre is alright at poking, he's not exactly the best (like people with 8
frame jabs and the like). HOWEVER, even when pitbulling, there are going
to be times the opponent gets his turn to attack (most attacks in Tekken have
frame disadvantage when blocked, so smart ppl will know to starting jabbing
back and stuff to interrupt... just don't bother trying to interrupt and
Devil/Angel player after a blocked 1,1...), so you will need to poke at
some stages to keep the opponent from attacking you non-stop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**********************
*  11) TECH-BAITING  *
**********************

Hmmm, well, this section is essentially about anti-techroll tactics, such as
doing the uf+4,uf+4,d+1,FC,f+2 but leaving off the FC,f+2 and if they
techroll, run up to them and uf+4 hopkick them again... Anyway, I thought
this could have some potential (like Ogre's easily techable juggles using
f,f+1+2) so I decided to add this little section. I prolly won't get too
much into the details, and besides, it's up to you to do want you want/need
to do.

-Setting Up-

Note: The moves in () are the moves that you DON'T do but your opponent
anticipates and so (hopefully) techrolls.

uf+4, df+1_uf+4, (f,f+1+2)
uf+4, uf+4, d+1, (FC,f+2)
FC+3,3,N+3, 4 (Not techable, but some will still tech after they get hit away)
FC+3,3,N+3, df+1_uf+4 (FC+3,3,N+3_f,f+1+2)
Oh, and pretty much any other techable juggles but these ones are usually
better as they end up at a nice distance. You can also just do a single
move that juggles (df+2(CH)/uf+4) and let them go straight back down as if you
totally screwed the juggle, and they do a techroll to avoid okizeme (though
you might as well do the above stuff to dish out more damage and just as
effective anyway, methinks, as it puts them at a ideal range).

-Following Up-

You need to anticipate if they will techroll. If they do, here are some moves
that I found can be useful to punish them with.

Note: For most of this stuff, you will hafta reposition yourself, such as
running in, turning and stuff. BTW, this stuff isn't all guaranteed (you can
techroll and recover crouching, so throws, apart from their escapes, aren't
really guaranteed, but still effective to an extent nonetheless). Hell, I'm
sure half the stuff can be blocked with good timing but anyway. BTW, you
should take into account what tracks well and to which side and all.

uf+4
FC,f+2
FC,df+2
f,f+2
b+2
f,f,N+2
Throw (Waning Moon if you can)
WS+3,3,d+3,3... (Do an Instant WS for more effectiveness)
UF,N+3
UF,WS+3,3,d+3,3... (The landing fromt he jump produces a WS)
UF,FC,f+2
UF,FC,df+2
UF,Throw

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

************************
*  12) Redeeming Ogre  *
************************

Ok ok, first off, I'll explain what I'm talking about. Hopefully you realise
by now that Ogre has been made into a pretty povass character now, as he's
lost a lot of speed and damage on his moves. Not only have they made him no
longer cheap, but they took it a step further and made him crap! Ahh hell.
On the plus side True Ogre is mad but this is about Ogre anyway.

-Advantages-

He's pretty big but still counts as a normal sized character, though on some
moves he won't go as high as a normal character (I think Hwoarang's sky 
rocket doesn't launch him very high). He also has a very good sidestep,
which you should use a lot cos if you manage to avoid an attack, a lot of
the time you will end up at their side or even back, making them vunerable
to many attacks. However, it's a good idea to not get too happy on the
sidestep, cos good tracking moves will hit you, so to counter this, you
should make use of the sidestep cancel - (u,N)_(d,N),B. This will give you
evasive AND blocking properties (though you usually end up moving sideways
less). Other stuff that is still an advantage for him is that he still has
a lot of "combos" that do a tonne of damage eg. WS+2(Clean Hit),4/FC,df+2,
f,f+1+2/WS+3,3,d+3,3... (first 4 guaranteed if first connects). Also, Ogre
can take a fair bit of punishment due to his high stamina (second highest I
think).

-Disadvantages-

A lot of stuff here. His moves have been toned down, A LOT. His WS+2 is
slower and can be escaped, his standing 4 is also slower (and less
damaging), his uf+3,4 blocked don't have guaranteed followups anymore I
don't think, and the list goes on.

-Moves/Stuff to Use/Abuse-

I've written a list of moves or chain of moves and stuff that you should abuse
with Ogre that are the most effective and damaging. I've also put in an
analysis about each on how to use it to really keep your opponent on their
heels.

Note: Stuff marked with a * mean that they aren't as good to use so much as
the others but they still remain rather effective.

-Analysis-

1,1_2

Good to poke around with still, as they are quick and do some nice damage. Try
mixing around with throws and stuff. It sux now that the 1,1,2 isn't
guaranteed unless on CH (only the first 1 hits, the second gets blocked. On CH
both 1's will hit and thus you can hit 2 for free).

df+1
Good to use a lot, as long as you don't think they're gonna pull out a fast
jab, cos although this is relatively quick, it still don't beat a jab. It's
also safe if blocked, and if hit it leads up to a bunch on custom stringing
and mixing up. And also this is irreversable, so from all views, I find it
pretty safe and good. It gives a +8 frame advantage, so you can go for a throw
straight after (WANING MOON! Though don't get predicatable as smart people
will escape it after a while. You could try 1+3 once in a while, especially if
you're low on health, that way you can tag out) as they'll have 4 frames to do
something, so apart from Yoshi's flash (which doesn't stop throws mind you),
the only thing I can think of to avoid it is to duck, but generally most
people don't duck after getting hit. Though remember, mix it up, if you keep
on trying to throw, they'll start ducking soon enough... and then you can
df+4 them instead. Or even go for another df+1, +8 frame advantage, 14 frames
to hit, meaning they have 6 frames to do something. Or if they stay standing
and you did the df+1 instead of a throw, then only Yoshi's flash will stop
it (though depends, cos even though Yoshi flash has time to interrupt, it
doesn't mean it will connect, but it might), if they try to interrupt they'll
get hit, it they stand there and block you'll be safe! Once again, a very
good move to use, and safe as well (including irreversable as said before).
Other than that, you can always go for a guaranteed d+1 and then into
whatever from FC (including WS. BTW, infinity kicks can't be interrupted if
you connect with d+1. Good for pressuring).

df+4
Another good poking move. Quick, ranged, nice damage. Make sure to chicken
buffer, so easy to do after all.

d+4,[4]
Good to mix around with df+4 due to the different hit ranges. Don't use the
second 4 much unless the opponent doesn't know to duck under. If you do use
the second 4, buffer a chicken. BTW, try not to overuse or you'll get
lowparried.

FC,df+2
If you're opponent isn't blocking low, definitely throw out. A guaranteed
f,f+1+2 after dishes out some nice damage, helping to turn the tables in your
favour (note: f,f+1+2 is reliable but there are other followups). Just don't
get predictable as you will get blocked and punished. BTW, try not to always
set this up with a d+1 as everyone knows whenver (True) Ogre goes into d+1
they will pretty much either go for infinity kicks or this. You can try
doing this standalone, as in going into FC instantly and doing it real quick
so as not to give any early warnings to your opponent.

FC+3,3,(d+3)_(N+3)
These will still do some good damage and you can mix around as well, although
by now most ppl can tell the difference between the enders (I know I can =P).
These used to be guaranteed on CH, not sure about now though. The FC+3,3,N+3
is a great juggle ender.

WS+2
Although this is much slower and therefore harder to connect with, if you do
it at the right time, you can take off A LOT of their damage. Don't always do
this with the oh-so-obvious custom string df+1,d+1,WS+2 cos if they crouch,
they'll still get hit, but we're looking for a CLEAN HIT to do some major
shit, and if you hit with the df+1,d+1, they're usually too far away to get
hit clean. Do this with and instant WS if you think they'll do something that
isn't quicker than this and they BAM! Clean hit! Standing 4! (or Waning Moon,
but standing 4 has shock factor :P). However, due to stuns being able to
escaped and the bad initiation and recovery of this move, this shouldn't
really by used in anything above intermediate levels of play.

WS+3,3,d+3,3...
Stick with the first four as they're guaranteed with after the first hits.
This is another thing that's quite reliable as it does a lot of damage for
just a 10 frame windup. Once again, don't get predictable with custom strings
or d+1's and stuff, try doing instant WS and added with the 10 frames, it'll
take about 13-15 frames to get going, so if you anticipate their moves (like
if you know they'll go for a crouchdash or something) you can do a lot of
damage. Also, if you know (or can see on reaction) you will get blocked, try
to mix up the d+3,3... with df+3... so you don't get lowparried.

uf+3,4,3
Although not as good as before, this still does good damage on all 3 hits and
still gives you some advantage when blocked, 7 frames that is, allowing for
some good stuff still, like a Waning Moon. Cos if you buffer the motion then
it'll take like 12-14 frames leaving them with 5-7 frames to do something,
and the only person who could do something is Yoshi (b+1+4 - 4 frames!), but
unless they're really good, they prolly won't do it. You could do a d+4,[4]
as that's also 12 frames, and so they have 5 frames to crouch, so if they
aren't planning to, they prolly won't do it in time. Not really something to
overuse though, more of a pressure move at the right times.

SS+4
His only new move, sorta good, BUT NOT ENOUGH!!! Anyway, this is quite a nice
addition apart from being the only one, as his sidestep game is very good and
added with a low attack off it, it makes for some nice stuff. Of course, if
you throw this out EVERY SINGLE TIME you sidestep, you will get lowparried or
blocked.

f,f+2
Good to use if you know they won't try to attack and they will just try to
block cos most people won't react in time. This is good to throw out now and
then to suprise them and then juggle after, but don't overuse cos it can be
interrupted easily and escaped. Other then getting interuppted or escaped,
this is pretty good to use as it is irreversable and doesn't get sidestepped
too easily. But when you think about it, this means that it won't be too
useful above intermediate level (but will sure whoops those scrubs' asses!).

f,f,N+2
Similar to the f,f+2 in use as you should use it to catch people off guard.
This is a bit slower (and easier to see - purple flashy stuff, think about
it) but it can't get escaped like the f,f+2. However, don't overestimate
its range cos he sorta uses his elbow (well, his hands positioned to stab
but he ain't got a knife, so the elbow's the furthest part) and so the
range is less than you may think. Good for a suprise and can be used a lot
more than f,f+2 cos it's more reliable (as long as you don't get
predictable, otherwise they'll jab you or something).

b+2
Pretty much the same as above, 'cept this is a tad slower but it doesn't have
a f,f,N motion which can give it away sometimes, so they sorta cancel. Good
to use as a suprise attack.

b+2+3
Use this when you anticipate your opponent stuffing up or if they sidestep too
much and you know they won't be able to recovery and either hit you or get
away in time. This has good range so it becomes quite useful and often catches
people out. Also, can be used against an opponent getting up off the
ground due to it's range, where you can remain at a safe distance and charge
in to smack them (good against ankle kickers, and people who get up with a
sweep of kick, just dash in, then out, they'll try to kick, do the
unblockable, they get up, Ogre charges in, WHAM!) Alternatively, smack them
around a bit with okizeme and then pull this one out. HOWEVER, I wouldn't
advise using too often cos once you hit b+2+3 there's no turning back and
a good opponent might just wavedash right up to you and EWGF your ass. If
only this was cancellable... but it isn't, deal with it =P

Custom Strings and Poking
Use these a lot and mixup as they will keep Ogre on the offense where he
belongs. Poke to keep the opponent away from you as even though Ogre should be
played as a pitbull, he can't match up against people like Julia and her 8
frame jab which can juggle on CH (1~1,1) up close and personal, much less
Kuma's 8 frame super long reach jab... So poke a lot and keep at moderate
range and on the offense, and when you see the chance, start up a custom
string and stuff, or juggle them if you can. Against better players, they
will remain calm and try to interrupt you when they see the chance (which is
not that hard because even I know practically every blocked move leaves the
the person at a disadvantage, cept of course the Mishima's who can 1,1, 1,1,
d+1, WS+4,4 all day long... ehehehe), which is why you generally shouldn't
continue custom strings if they block the df+1 or other parts (like 1,1,
which can be interrupted pretty easily after but not many people know to do
so, and so they remain blocking). Of course, there are the occasional decent
players who don't know that after blocking they usually have advantage, and
they continue to block until you do a move with a long recovery. Hell, there
are some real good players that don't even know what netsu is eehehhehehe.

FC mixup
Use this a lot as you can get in some major damage if they block wrong
(WS+3,3,d+3,3 does heaps if they tried crouching, or alternatively,
FC,df+2, and followups does lots if they just stand there). Also, remember
to throw in a FC+4 now and then to keep them on their heels (some
might be expecting infinity kicks, FC,df+2, or something, so don't be
repetitive).

Waning Moon
A powerful throw, and powerful followups. Even though escapable, it's very
reliable with a 1+2 escape (though for good players it doesn't matter that
much as they anticipate) and the followups do some nice damage. Pull this
out of your ass when they least expect it, though not really after a WS+2
stun anymore because 1) you shouldn't get doing gutpunch too much, prolly
not at all against good players cos it'll be escaped and 2) a Waning Moon
throw after a gutpunch stun is so obvious... Or you can try the HAN special
- df+1 then Waning Moon (therefore df+1, df,DF+2+4).

Juggles
Amongst all the mixing up and shit, try to get in juggles, cos Ogre's juggles
are decent enough and so you can do some ok damage. The uf+4 hopkick is
pretty reliable but you need to anticipate cos when this is blocked I'm pretty
sure you are at 10 frames disadvantage at least (can't remember, but I'm
pretty sure that Mishima's 1,1,2 jabs connect after a blocked hopkick). The
d,db+4 is good to throw out now and then (don't get predictable, it can be
sidestepped easily and then you are in for it) because if blocked, yer safe,
if hits, go for okizeme, if CH, go for a good juggle.

Okizeme
This is one of Ogre's strongest points (and even more so with True Ogre =D).
USE IT! This is like Ogre's equivalent of a Mishima'a (E)WGF - though you
can't do it over and over against an opponent in any situation like a bloody
bastard :P.

-General Strategy-
This is apart from whatever playing strategy you are using. Use okizeme as
much as possible. This still retains its effectiveness in TTT so abuse it,
you can get in some good damage with this. Even just getting in one f,f,N+4
after each juggle is a good 20 points of damage! Avoid being on defense -
"The best defense is offense" - because Ogre isn't too good on the defense.
Nonetheless there are times you will be forced on the defense (blocked EWGF
for example...) so get good at poking your opponent out of moves to get back
on the offense. And Throws - Be cheesy and throw a lot, just no predicatably.
And if your opponent gets out of your throws too much don't bother too much.
If they duck them all the time uf+4 hopkick them =D. Mix in with custom
strings.

-Stuff (previously mentioned or not)-
*If you connect with d+1, WS+3,3,d+3,3 can't be interrupted.
*df+1 gives +8 frame advantage on a hit. Guaranteed d+1 (therefore go into
WS+3,3,d+3,3 or do a near-guaranteed throw (they have 4 frames to do
something. For Yoshi, no prob :P but his flash dun stop throws anyway eheh).
*WS+4 (by iteslf, not with the second 4) gives +8 frames advantage, and you
can buffer the Waning Moon motion (and 4) while recovering from the kick, so
they opponent has 4 frames (again) to escape a Waning Moon. Though sometimes
they won't be close enough for the throw to reach, so only do if you are sure.
Mix the throws around sometimes as well so that they won't be able to escape
every time.
*If your opponent is smart and can actually block/parry the low kick of the
infinity kicks (the third kick), then go for a mid :D. Though if you use the
infinity kicks at the right time and when they'll hit (very easy, especially
when you duck high attacks, cos it takes only 10 frames and then 3/4
guaranteed hits!).
*Although uf+3,4 blocked doesn't have guaranteed hits anymore, you still get
+7 frames of advantage. Same situation as a hit df+1 really, therefore, you
can go for a throw pretty safely (5 frames for them to react). And Waning Moon
buffers alright into the uf+3,4 pretty well I think (though not too sure,
can't quite remember). Of course uf+3,4 isn't the best move to use anyway,
easily interrupted and all.
*You can try using a single 2 to set up throws in the same manner as a hit
df+1, as a 2 (same speed as 1, 10 frames. But better recovery) on a hit will
give +7 frame advantage and comes out quicker than a df+1, so you can use this
to set up throws as well (oh yeah, custom strings as well. This applies for
the other setup moves as well, just forgot to mention.).

********************
*  13) CONCLUSION  *
********************

Well, I would like to thank Renick for originally helping me with this FAQ
(I have no idea why I even bothered writing this FAQ earlier this year either
but oh well I did and I got help off him =P). Ogre has been toned down heaps
since T3, however, he still has pretty damaging moves, though less effective
(slower and less damaging). He has a HUGE sidestep, which is very good as he
isn't a big character (but he doesn't always get floated as high :P) like his
fatass friend True Ogre who has a gay sidestep and is a fatass as previously
mentioned but he's way more powerful anyway =D. Armed with moves of different
hit ranges (low,mid,high) and range (distance), Ogre has the ability to play a
very good mixup game and fight at a variety of ranges. He has many good moves
off the crouch, adding even more to his mixing up, while his okizeme really
kicks some ass. Oh, and did I mention that he's in the second highest rank of
stamina/endurance or whatever. If only he had a crouch dash (and thus
wavedash) and EWGF and all... now if only True Ogre had that... anyway, in the
end, Ogre is by no means the greatest of characters but he's still fun to play
and if you really need to be kicking someones ass, use True Ogre =D Anyway...
play Ogre skillfully and decisively and kick some ass (alternatively play
True Ogre and destroy everyone... either that or serve as a jugglee for
crowd pleaser juggles) - FEEL THE POWER!

*****************
*  14) CREDITS  *
*****************

I would like to give credit and thanks to the following people:

Renick, for helping me with this FAQ, his pretty good Ogre FAQ that helped me
a lot (a couple of his things are a little outdated and I think he hasn't be
bothered changing it ehehhehe), helping me with Ogre stuff now and then on
the Tekken Zaibatsu forums. Hmmm, that was some time ago now, but anyway, oh
well, TTT's getting sorta old and all the vets at Zaibatsu tend to be less in
appearance now, damn those chit chat cafe FREAKS and their crap topics and
shit!!! CAST THEM INTO THE COLD DEPTHS OF OBLIVION!!! =P

Ug the Caveman, Catfish, Shukudai and anyone else for helpful information now
and then and a good challenge as well. Any other Brisbane players that I
don't hate cos you are cheapass and beat me with your cheapness because I
don't play enough to get enough experience to beat your cheapass down! =D
See, like Catfish, he's pretty good (he can do EWGF and all that
consistently), but I can still beat him here and there cos he fights
"honestly" so to speak, not like a cheapass! You cheapasses can burn! And
just cos I use Bryan/Bruce a fair bit doesn't make me cheap hehehe

Killing_Angel for getting a PS2 and TTT =D Both him and Dim Sim for letting
me destroy them in TTT... shame that's about the only ppl I can destroy =P

Catlord, for a couple Ogre juggles I borrowed from his combo compendium, and
also for writing that bastard of a thing, now I don't have to get FAQs for
each characters JUST to get some juggles! (Not to mention his has a LOT of 
juggles for each character while some FAQs have only a few, and his sez the
# of hits, damage [for the most part] and difficulty to boot!

Triple Lei, for bothering to format this to fit properly in a browser (even
though I reformatted it a little - I just can't stand reading stuff that put
single
words on a line by itself :P)

Cosmic Forge aka Dark Savant, for his awesome tag juggle (f,f+4,
FC+3,3,N+3~5, f,f,N+1+2), and also his little trick on doing FC moves
quicker (which led to me discovering an adapted version). And also cos he's
got some great Yoshi info and Yoshi r0x0rs!

Pete Hahn, for some good stuff from his Waning Moon FAQ that I put in this
FAQ (mainly his "HAN" special).

Castel and the Tekken Zaibatsu crew (as per usual with any FAQ made by an
enlightened Tekkenite :P oh that's right, I'm a Royal Tekkenite now on
zaibatsu, which means nothing due to those chit chat cafe shits and their
Grand Tekken Psycho and Tekken Pimp Daddy or whatever, that's right
Catfish, ppl like you! =P), for making Tekken Zaibatsu and its forums,
(http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/), cos that's where I get practically all
of my Tekken info, and also those kickass juggle movies (which I took a
few juggles from and added here :D).

Namco, for making the Tekken series, which out of all the other fighting games
I've played, is the one I'm best at :) (though I still suckass anyway)

The good people of the world who make anime which satisfies my hunger for
violence and destruction. Now only if everyone else would watch anime, then
there would be no crime and war (look at Japan! hehe).

The good ppl who make games like Diablo 2 and Counterstrike =D And Heavy Gear
2 was pretty cool as well probably because half the stuff was ripped from
Anime (it was so blatantly obvious mon! hehehehe) but pretty cool anyway,
just wish they had that big more variety of weapons instead of like 5 weapons
of the same type just each one bigger than the next hehehehe

God, for giving me strength - FEEL THE POWER!!! WAHAHAHAHAHAHA =D

And YOU (as per usual with most other FAQS), and anyone else who reads this
and actually thinks it's decent... also anyone who decided to read it because
they THOUGHT it MIGHT be decent :)
