1. Version History
==================
1.0 A very useful FAQ's is born...
1.1 Changed the combos section into two parts. Escapable and Inescapable combos.
1.2 Just added more combos. Keep them coming.
1.3 More combos. Sorry this took so long. I thought I was done with Tag. Who am I kidding...
========
2. Story
========
This is easy. There is no story to Tekken Tag Tournament. The game doesn't build on the Tekken
storyline at all. This is just a "Dream Match" game. Nothing more.

===============
3. Introduction
===============
I'll make this brief because I want to answer most questions in the FAQ's Section. This a FAQ's
on doing 70 point damage combos. The FAQ's section will tell you what's so special about 70 
point combos and why they are important. This FAQ's is not for beginners because 70 point combos
are not easy. At least not all of them. But whatever. Check out the FAQ's section.

============================
5. Frequetly Asked Questions
============================
Who are you?
I'm William Matthews. Also known as The Realyst on the Tekken Zaibatsu and Gamefaqs forums.

How long have you been playing Tekken?
Since Tekken 2, hardcore since Tekken 3. I guess that would be since 1995 then.

I play Playstation 2. Why do you use 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 instead of Square, Triangle, X and O?
If you read the top of this FAQ's, you will see that this is not just a FAQ's for the PS2.
It's also for the arcade and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are universal. If your reading this FAQ's you
should know that.

What is your defintion of a combo?
My definition of a combo is stringing of attacks that when the first hit connects, the
following hits are guaranteed unless your opponent consciously escapes it. Other people
don't consider a combo a combo unless all hits are guaranteed. But if your combo is not
escaped, isn't the damage still done? Isn't it still a combo? It's your opponents job 
to stop your combo. If they don't, it's still a combo.

What's so special about 70+ point combos? Why not 50 or 60 or 100 point combos?
70 is the minimum damage necessary for you to do 50% damage or half the opponents energy in
damage. Generally, two of these combos will K.O. your opponent.

I did a 70 point combo to [character of choice here] twice and they didn't get Koed. What gives?
Like I said before 70 points is the minimum damage necessary. Two 70 point combos will KO
some characters, but not all. Reason being is that different characters in Tekken Tag
Tournament, have different maximum stamina. Some have 140 points of stamina in which case, two
70 point combos will KO them. But some characters have more. So two combos that is exactly 70
points won't KO them.

What characters have what amount of maximum stamina points?
There is a whole big stamina class chart at www.tekkenzaibatsu.com. But to make things easier,
I'll just tell you exactly how many points each character has.

Paul, Law, Kunimitsu, Ling Xiaoyu, Michelle, Unknown, Jun, Nina, Wang, Alex/Roger and Heihachi
all have 140 points of stamina.

Jin, Lei, Yoshimitsu, Hwoarang, Eddy/Tiger, Julia, Lee, Bryan, Anna, Baek, Bruce, Kazuya, 
Mokujin/Tetsujin all have 151 points of stamina.

King has 153 points of stamina.

Armor King and Ganryu have 155 points of stamina.

Ogre has 161 points of stamina.

Kuma/Panda, Gun Jack, Jack 2, P. Jack, True Ogre, Devil/Angel all have 168 points of stamina.

What is CH and why is it important?
CH stands for Counter Hit. It's the biggest key to getting 70+ combos done. A counter hit is
when you interupt your opponents attack with an attack of your own. It is important because
the hit you use to interupt the opponents attack will do more damage and in some cases, it's
required for the combo. Some moves will not launch your opponent unless it hits as a counter
hit. I'll provide you with the combos, you'll have to figure out how to get counter hits on
your own.

Is a CH required for all 70+ point combos?
No. Some characters are just good at juggling and can do over 70 damage without a counter hit. But
most will require a counter hit. At least most of the ones on this FAQ's will.

Can you escape 70+ combos?
Yes you can. A lot of them you can quick roll, stun escape etc. out of. I'm not that bad of a guy,
so I'll even let you know when you can escape from whatever combos if possible.

Why are there no Tag Combos listed?
These are some of the most damage combos in the game. You can easily mix combos together to make
a good Tag Juggle. I can't do it all for you.

7. Send Combos
==============
Ok, you want to send me a combo to put on this FAQ's, all you have to do is :
a. Tell me what character the combo is for 
b. Tell me how much damage in points the combo is (And it must be 70 or more)
c. Tell me if it's escapable and if it is, how and at what point in the combo can it be escaped
d. Email all of that to me to sendcombo@yahoo.com

I know that there not that many combos, but I want to make it a lot. I need combos that's
for big characters. I need  combos for character with the least amount of combos. So combos
I don't need combos for Bryan, Bruce, Jin, Heihachi and Julia. I'll except them, but combos
for other character will take prority over them. Send right away! As far as I know this FAQ's
will only be used on www.tekkenzaibatsu.com and www.gamefaqs.com. So I'll thank all the sites
visitors as credit. I can't list everyone name that gave me a combo. Some of these combo are mine
and I didn't even give credit to myself!

=========
8. Thanks
=========
I'd like to thank all of Tekken Zaibatsu and the few folks left on the Gamefaqs.com TTT board
for helping me out with this. It's greatly appreciated. A special thanks goes out to Maxi Milian
from the TZ boards for not assuming that because I'm new to the boards, that I'm new to Tekken and
for that Law combo. And let's not forget the company that made this all possible, Namco.
What can I say. You made probably the deepest 3d fighting game of all time. Thanks and much
respect. Keep it up. I'm waiting for Tekken Tag Tournament 2!
