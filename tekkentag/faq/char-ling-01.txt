	If you are reading this, I expect you already have a good 
understanding of Tekken Tag, and at least a playable understanding 
of Ling Xiaoyu.
	All feedback is GREATLY appreciated, as I am a sucker for 
compliments as a reason to continue work.

PROFILE
*******

Ling Xiaoyu ("Schoolgirl in High Spirits")
	- I have researched her name, and have the official characters for 
her name from a cute little teacup I won in a tournament.  It reads as follows:

Xiao - Dawn
yu   - Rain
Ling - Sunrise (Ling *IS* her surname)

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Country of Origin: 	China
Fighting Style: 	Hakke Ken, Hike Ken and various Chinese martial arts
Age: 			16
Height: 		157 cm ( 5'1½"  )
Weight: 		42 kg  ( 93 lbs )
Blood Type: 		A
Occupation: 		Student, Panda caretaker
Hobby: 			Traveling, visiting amusement parks all over the world.
Likes: 			Chinese steamed buns and shrimp dumplings.  Peking Duck.
Dislikes: 		Math teachers
	
Strengths:
	- She's fast, very fast.
	- She's got many mixups
	- Most of her moves have good recovery, often fooling opponents
	- She's a small character, thus more difficult to juggle.
	- She's evasive as peace in the middle east
	- Has some very good medium level attacks
	- Decent Juggle ability, including some very fast starters
	- Some of her attacks do very good damage for thier speed
	- Often lands counterhits
	- Incredible sidesteps
	- 4 Stances
	- She's left-handed

Weaknesses:
	- She hits like a little girl
	- She takes damage like a little girl
	- With her back turned, she's vunerable if you're not careful (Whiffs are 
	  deadly)
	- Some of her attack strings have weaknesses, especially when she turns her 
	  back.  
	- She has very few low attacks with any priority
	- Short Attack Range

	I want to start by saying that Ling is the reason I started 
playing Tekken.  I had on and off played Tekken 2, but it was no more 
than a passing phase.  I simply saw Tekken 3 come in at the local arcade, 
and decided to give it a shot.  It just so happened that Ling caught my 
eye (I think it was the name, actually, "Xiaoyu" - I couldn't pronounce 
it at the time, and wanted to hear the announcer say it ^^).  
	After checking out the listed moves, I was wowed by her style, 
and fell in love after that.  I also loved her speed compared to other 
characters.  Thus began my Tekken addiction.  
	Over the years of playing Tekken I have used other characters, 
but noone has surpassed my love affair with the small chinese 
schoolgirl (draw whatever meaning from this sentance you wish).  I have 
had only one teacher, Lin, a korean girl at my arcade who taught me some 
strategy early on.  Other than that, Ling players have been extremely 
rare (I've seen maybe 10 good other Ling players), and this has been an 
advantage, as my style has mostly developed on it's own, making it less 
like the normal Ling player than most.  
	All in all, I play more of a no-nonsense Ling than most people 
I've seen.  I tend to take simple evasion techniques as opposed to large 
ones, making it easier to capitalize on mistakes my opponent makes, of 
which I encourage.

**********************************************************************
**********************************************************************

DEFENSE

	Ling is fast.  Very fast.  Her left jab is tied for the fastest 
execution in Tekken at 8 frames, and her right kick is as fast as most 
people's jabs at 10.  Her movement is quick as lightning, and is probably 
the fastest, or among the top 3 (Julia, Michelle and Kuni are up there 
as well).  
	Because of this, Ling's defensive strategy SHOULD NOT be based 
on blocking.  Note: this does NOT mean "do not block with Ling", but 
rather, there are better options.  
	As for me, there are several that I tend to use:

************************
DEFENSE IN NORMAL STANCE
************************

a) 1, 2: Bayonet (10/10)
	This move is GREAT vs. frontal attacks.  Not only are these 
jabs fast as hell, there recovery is really good, and on hit you gain 
a 9, read it, 9 frame advantage.  In theory, if you Bayonet twice in 
a row with no delay, if the first pair hits, you should get a second.  
	This move stops any frontal momentem, and can turn the tide of 
the battle in a lot of situations.  They tend to interupt a LOT of 
attacks.
	These should be used at close range only, as whiffing entirely 
does give the opponent an (albeit small) advantage.

Followups:
	- See Strategy : Pitbull

b) SS: Sidestep (9/10)
	Ling's sidestep is VERY fast, and VERY large.  In close range, 
her wrap around can be enough for a back throw, and always for a side 
throw.  
	This should especially be used on opponents making 
forward-momentum attacks from close-medium range.

Followups:
	- See Strategy : Evasion - Preemptive/Reactive

c) d+1,2: Sunrise Fan (8/10)
	This is an EXCELLENT move when it's pulled off.  
Unfortunately, it's fast, but not blindingly so (14 frame execution), and 
has poor recovery (18 frames) when blocked.  On the up side, the move hits 
mid, hits many times (which often confuses the opponent enough to keep 
the opponent from reprising immediately on a partial hit), is high 
priority, and juggles for decent damage followup.  
	This should be used at close to medium range, and only when 
the opponents attack is somewhat slow, or you can anticipate his attack
well.

Followups:
	- See Juggling : Sunrise Fan

d) 4: Standing right kick (7/10)
	This move is fast, equal to most people's front jabs.  What's 
better is that on counter hit (which is quite common), it floats the 
opponent.  As a juggle, if you are REALLY quick (you almost have to 
anticipate it, but it is possible to do on reaction) you can hit them 
with a Storming Palm before they hit the ground.  
	The down side is that this move doesn't have as much range 
as her Bayonet (which actually sometimes is an advantage, but I 
digress).  
	This move should be used almost exclusively at close range, 
and can be thrown out almost at random.  Works very well on charging 
opponents and okay after a canceled charge.  

Followups:
	- Storming Palm (d/b+1) Juggle, dash

e) b+1+2: Rain Dance (9/10)
	This move has less speed, and sidesteps slightly less than her 
normal sidestep, but on the bright side, Ling ends up in Rain Dance.  
Often, after this move, you can pull off a Mistrust before they 
recover.  
	This move can be used ALMOST the same as her sidestep, but 
should not be used when people tend to use, very fast poking, quick 
recovery moves, or 360 degree axis moves, as doing so tends to 
compromise Ling's life.  

Followups:
	- See Tactics : Evasion

f) B+4, SS+4: Back Kick (4/10)
	This move is only good on slow moves, and is not 
neccessarily the best to use.  One advantage is that Ling slightly 
backsteps during execution.
	This move should NEVER be just thrown out unless you expect 
to hit on counter, as the recovery is horrid.  Use at medium range.

Followups:
	- See Offense/Defense : Rain Dance

g) d/b+2: Storming Palm (7/10)
	This move is fairly fast, but not extremely, which makes 
it lose a few points.  The reason it is so highly rated, though, 
is that it can be absolutely DEVISATING to your opponent on counter.  
Not quite Paul's Phoenix Smasher, but hurts enough coming from Ling.  
	Use at Medium Range.

Followups:
	- See Offense : Charging Tactics

h) 2, 1: April Showers (6/10)
	The first hit is 10 frames, and the second turns Ling around, 
leaving her ready for Rain Dance.  Unfortunately, after this move, 
Ling doesn't always have such a great frame advantage, which can 
get her slaughtered if you're not careful against good players.  Can 
also hold d/b to cancel the turn to rain dance if you wish.
	Use at close to medum range.

Followups:
	- See Offense : Rain Dance

g) 1+2: Double Palm Strike (3/10)
	This is a new move to Tag, and frankly I toss it out more 
by accident than by choice.  In my opinion, it is a very "Un-Ling" 
move, taking 20 frames to connect.  It does, however, have the 
longest range of any of her moves (except her unblockable).
	Do NOT use this at close range EVER, unless you want to 
attend her funeral.  Best used at Medum to Long range on obvious 
attacks, though other, better options are available (Storming 
Palm).

Followups:
 	- See Okizeme : General

h) d/f+1: Belly Chop (7/10)
	This move has slower execution than April Showers, but 
has better recovery, thus giving Ling more of an advantage once 
her back is turned.  Also, the first hit goes out further.  Great 
in custom strings, and allows you to play a change up game by 
going into/not going into rain dance.
	Use at close to medium range.

Followups:
	- Consult Offense : Rain Dance

i) Throw: Throw (6/10)
	Ling's throwing game is very important, and being as 
quick as she is, you can connect them very often.  Throw them 
into her strings often.  
	Should only be used in close range.  

Followups:
	- Consult Okizeme : Throws

j) d+1: Sunset Fan (7/10)
	This move is not great on speed (17 frames), but has 
great priority.  It hits 3 times, mid, and stops most attacks 
cold once it's out.  Followups leave something to be desired 
however, because good players know she recovers crouching or 
in the phoenix position.  
	Use in medium range.

Followups:
	- Cyanide (u/f+4)
	- Bayonet (1,2)
	- Double Palm Strike (1+2)
	- Skyscraper Kick (WS+4)
	- Sunflower (WS+2)
	- On {D}, consult Offense : Phoenix Position

k) d+1+2: Phoenix Position (10/10)
	This move is Ling's best evasion tactic.  She ducks 
over all high, and most medium attacks, causing most moves 
to miss her.  After that, the opponents are at your mercy.  
	Be wary of players who will goad you to enter the 
phoenix position in order to hit you out of it.  Ling cannot 
block in the Phoenix position.

Followups:

		Wave Crest
	- Firecracker (4~3)
	- Consult Offense : Phoenix Position

l) 1+4_d+1+4_d/f: Mid/ Low Thrust Blocks (6/10)
	The mid thrust block is good for stopping momentum, 
but unfortunately, Ling doesn't have any spectacular followups 
albeit going on the offensive.  The only thing guaranteed, I 
think, is the 1-2 punches.
	The low thrust block is a great move, however.  
Following it, just about any of Ling's basic moves are 
guaranteed.  

Followups:
	- Mid Thrust:
		- Bayonet (1,2)
		- Consult Offense : Pitbull or Evasion
	- Low Thrust:
		- Storming Palm (d/b+1)
		- Sunrise Fan (d/f+2,1)
		- Throw

m) 1+4_d+1+4: Left/Right Spinners (2/10)
	These suck for defense, use the other sidesteps 
instead.  

Followups:
	- See Offense : Sidestep

o) b+1_b+2: Great Wall Left and Right (5/10)
	This move is really not that great.  The range really 
sucks, and whiffing is not a good idea.  If you hold B and 
manage to connect, you will change to rain dance, but will 
be at a slight frame disadvantage.  

Followups:
	- See Defense : Rain Dance

********************
DEFENSE WHEN DUCKING
********************

	As a rule, Ling is NOT best served by ducking.  She 
has a better repetoire in the phoenix position, as well as less 
of a perchance to be hit (Namely by some Mid Level moves).  All 
ducking moves should be done at close range ONLY.  


p) WS+2: Sunflower (6/10)
	Apperantly, in the period where Tekken Tag takes place, 
it is obvious that one of the following has occured:
Ling is:
	a) Having her period
	b) Recovering from surgery
	c) A recent victim of Roger's voracious sexual appitite
	d) Been eating too many Steamed Buns

	As a result, this move has been butchered in Tag.  It 
now juggles only on Counterhit, making it a dangerous 
commodity (to HER!).  Ling ends in the rain dance, and may eat 
dirt if the move is blocked (reccomend an IMMEDIATE d+1).  
	Use only in close range, and ONLY if you think a 
counterhit is possible.

Note: due to an interesting timing glitch, I have been back 
      thrown out of this move.

Followups:
	- On counterhit, consult Juggles : Sunflower
	- On hit, consult Offense : Rain Dance
	- On block, consult Ground Recovery

q) WS+4: Skyscraper Kick (8/10)
	Very fast move to come out, and knocks down.  
Unfortunately, damage and followups leave much to be desired.  
Is GREAT for getting the opponent off your back, however.  

Followups:
	- See Okizeme : General

r) d/f+2, 1: Lotus Twist (3/10)
	I rarely use this move.  Frankly, it's not much damage, 
has low priority, and has a high mess-up factor.  I do use it 
occasionally because of the fact that if you hold d/f after the 
first hit and don't execute the second, Ling ends in Rain Dance, 
which can cause opponents to panic.  

Followups:
	- See Offense : Rain Dance
	
s) N, Throw: Stand and Throw (8/10)
	Ling's speed once again gives her the advantage.  People 
don't expect how fast this can come out.  If you get the timing for 
this down, it's almost instantaneous.

Followups:
	- See Okizeme: Throws

*********************
DEFENSE IN RAIN DANCE
*********************

	Ling is not really equipped to defend herself in the Rain 
Dance position.  Blocking is impossible, and almost all of her moves 
are slower.  This taken, it's important to avoid this situation if 
possible, but if it's not avoidable...

t) Throw: Throw (3/10)
	Ling's throw while turned around is slower, and if she 
whiffs, she's going to be in a world of pain.  This move is NOT 
suited for defense.  

Followups:
	- See Okizeme: Throws

u) 4: Mistrust (7/10)
	It comes out pretty fast, but many people know the timing 
of this, and it is only an okay move to use on defense (unless you're 
baiting the opponent).  The range is pretty good, though.  

Followups:
	- See Juggles: Mistrust

v) 3: Turn Kick (8/10)
	Comes out a bit faster than the Mistrust, which catches 
people by suprise.  Hits high, which is a bad thing, but usually 
people leave theirselves open when attacking Ling's backside.  

Followups:
	- None

w) 2, 1, 4: Dark & Stormie -> Mistrust: (9/10)
	Close to her fastest move with back turned (12 frames for 
the first hit).  Even better is on counterhit, the rest is guaranteed 
plus a juggle 

Followups:
	- See Juggles: Mistrust

x) d/f+2: Crouch Punch (7/10)
	I don't use it much, but it's the fastest move she can pull off 
in rain dance.  Is a good followup to a bad frame advantage back turn 
attempt, as it will usually snuff out most anything else.  

Followups:
	- See Offense: Crouching

y) SS: Sidestep (9/10)
	You have to anticipate a bit with this one (i.e. Start the 
sidestep early) because it's a bit slower then when she's face forward, 
but seems to sidestep farther, missing more moves.  

Followups:
	- Mistrust (4)
	- Throw
	- Dark and Stormie Changeups

z) 3+4_u+3+4: Spinners (7(9)/10)
	I have totally changed my opinion of this move recently, but 
only partially.  The 3+4 spinner is okay, it is a far sidestep, and 
she ends up close to the opponent in normal stance.
	The u+3+4 spinner, however, is REALLY, REALLY nice for agressive 
players against Ling's back.  The movement itself is like Yoshi's B+3+4, 
moves Ling to the side and away from the opponent, and gives her some 
room to work with, while simultaneously making many people whiff her.
Use it wisely.

Followups:
	- Mistrust (4)
	- Hop n' Throw
	- Cyclone (f,f+3+4,3+4)

***************************
DEFENSE IN PHOENIX POSITION
***************************

	In General, Ling can be hurt in the Phoenix Position if used 
carelessly.  However, it's also a great position in which to trick 
the opponent to attack you.  The latter is risky business, but can 
be very effective just the same.  

aa) 1_2: Left/Right Handful (7/10)
	They're quick, and interupt attacks.  Not great priority, 
but okay.  

Followups:
	- Sunflower (WS+2)
	- Skyscraper Kick (WS+4)

bb) ~1+2_1+2_d+1+2: Wave Crests (7/10)
	They're slower, but pack much more punch and juggle to 
boot.  

Followups:
	- See Juggles: Wave Crest

cc) 3: Knee Stabber (1/10)
	The only reason I write this one is to warn you NOT to 
use it.  You will be hurt from reprisal 90% of the time.  

Followups:
	- You hitting the ground
	- Firecracker (4~3) (If opponent is too slow)

dd) 4~3: Firecracker (8/10)
	Hits low, is quick, knocks opponent down.  Stops them 
dead, people don't usually expect it, either.  

Followups:
	- Low sweep (3 from the ground)

ee) 1+3_2+4, {D}: Cradle Throw (5/10)
	Good for an escape if you start early enough, but the 
throw is off axis a lot of the time, which makes it better to 
just cancel the throw.  All in all, not that great.

Followups:
	- See Okizeme: Throws

ff) u/f+3 {,4}: Hop Kick (9/10)
	This is a move I discovered the beauty of only recently.  
Really, it's strenth comes in that it is it's fast-as-hell 
execution after going into the Phoenix Position, alowing you to 
often catch people during recovery that you can't for any other 
move.  
	In addition, this move has VERY high priority against 
most attacks.  On top of that, it Juggles, and you can use it 
with her other jumping mix-ups.  Learn to use this.

Followups:
	- See Juggles: Wave Crest


***************************
DEFENSE IN HYPNOTIST STANCE
***************************

	Ling can do almost anything she can do in the normal 
stance from the Hypnotist Stance (including block).  The only 
exceptions are moves who's inputs overlap with her 2 moves 
from this stance.  (1,1+2)
	- See Defense: Normal Stance

*************************************************************
*************************************************************

OFFENSE

	Ling is without a doubt, an offensive character.  
However, there is one thing to remember: careless offensive 
tactics are not what Master Wang perscribed.  Instead, she 
is best used with a variety of pokes, confusion tactics, 
throws and juggles.  I believe that Ling has one of the best 
overall useful arsenals, with a ton of moves from every 
position, if you mix them effectively, your opponent will have 
no idea what to do.  When that happens, you've already won.  
	Along with not being predictable, there is another 
skill that will win you more matches than ANYTHING else: being 
able to predict and/or bait your opponent.  Ling has so many 
small poking moves, and has many moves from which recovery is 
very, very fast.  Used effectively, you can:
	- Snuff opponents attacks out
	- Major counter opponents attacks
	- Force them to choose between attack levels
	- Totally whiff her, leading to an easy juggle



************************
OFFENSE IN NORMAL STANCE
************************

a) 1, 2: Bayonet (10/10)
	Great in offense as well as defense.  Recovery is fast, 
and allows you to go directly into other moves.  A great move 
to throw out after any whiff, it tends to snuff out other 
attacks.  

Followups:
	- See Offense: Custom Stringing

b) SS: Sidestep (10/10)
	Thrown out at random, or even as a threataning tactic, 
Ling's sidestep is the best in the game.  Use it often

Followups:
	- See Offense: Custom Stringing

c) d+1,2: Sunrise Fan (7/10)
	Great move when you expect the next moves may occur 
simultaneously, as it tends to out-prioritize enemy attacks.  
Bad side is that if it's blocked, it has poor recovery.  
Creates a great changeup game with a throw, as the start of 
the animation is unthreatening.  Great on ducking opponents.  

Followups:
	- See Juggles: Sunrise Fan

d) 4: Standing right kick (9/10)
	Excellent in custom strings, and followup to blocked 
or whiffed moves.  Juggles on counterhit, with a Storming Palm 
followup (you must be VERY FAST).

Followups:
	- Storming Palm (d/b+1), Running Slide/Cross Chop 
		(WR 3_1+2)

e) b+1+2: Rain Dance (9/10)
	Great to throw out after moves, and just randomly.  
The sidestep from it will dodge most attacks, and leave you 
back-turned for a mistrust when they whiff.

Followups:
	- Mistrust (4)
	- Throw

f) B+4, SS+4: Back Kick (2/10)
	This move SUCKS on offense.  If the second part does 
NOT connect, Ling will see a world of pain.  It gets 2 points 
because it does decent damage if both hits connect.  

Followups:
	- Block and hope

g) d/b+2: Storming Palm (10/10)
	This move is in some respects better than Paul's 
Phoenix Smasher:
	- Easier execution
	- Easy to buffer
	- People don't expect it from Ling
	- It takes less space to execute

	The speed is about the same, as well.  It is 
important to note, however, that while it has good range, it 
is NOT anywhere NEAR Paul's (Ling has little tiny arms!).
	Also, this move is better if you throw it in a 
custom string, or after an opponent's whiffed attack, as 
it does have a slight windup time, and it tends to veil the 
attack.  
	Note: I just came home from my weekly Saturday night 
bouts at Taito: Akita, and I counterhit an entering Heihachi 
for around 45% damage, no joke.  This move ROCKS.

Followups:
	- See Offense: Charging	

h) 2, 1: April Showers (7/10)
	Good move to mix up the mix, and another good custom 
stringer.  It's also good to hold d/f after 1, to keep Ling 
in her normal stance most of the time (it creates a good 
mixup game for when you DON'T).

Followups:
	- See Offense: Custom Stringing
	- See Offense: Rain Dance

g) 1+2: Double Palm Strike (4/10)
	This move is only good occasionally.  Usually, I 
do it when the opponent is pushed out of Ling's normal range 
and starts a slower move, although often the Storming Palm 
is better.  I also occasionally use when people duck directly 
in front of me.  

Followups:
	- See Okizeme : General

h) d/f+1: Belly Chop (7/10)
	Another good custom stringer.  You can play the same 
hold d/f mixup with opponents to trick them.

Followups:
	- See Offense: Custom Stringing
	- See Offense: Rain Dance

i) Throw: Throw (9/10)
	Throws are one of Ling's strongest assets when used 
correctly.  I have found that while people know that I will 
throw them, can do nothing about it.  
	I tend to use her regular throws (1+3_2+4), and mix 
up which one I do (for people who escape throws).  They 
do good damage, and have good Okizeme (not guarenteed, but 
good, just the same).  
	Also, if a throw IS escaped, my most common response 
is to sidestep immediately, and throw again, changing the 
throw.  This gets people 85% of the time.  

Followups:
	- See Offense: Okizeme

j) d+1: Sunset Fan (5/10)
	This move is okay on offense, but I would not 
reccomend it very often.  It leaves Ling vunerable (either 
ducking or in the Phoenix Position) to good players.  Also, 
because of the range, it is primarily a defensive move.

Followups:
	- Cyanide (u/f+4)
	- Bayonet (1,2)
	- Double Palm Strike (1+2)
	- Skyscraper Kick (WS+4)
	- Sunflower (WS+2)
	- On {D}, consult Offense: Phoenix Position

k) d+1+2: Phoenix Position (10/10)
	This is excellent if you use it effectively.  It 
is great for frontal back-and-forth combat, as you can 
immediately follow it up with her Wave Crest-Quick for a 
juggle.  
	If the opponent does not immediately respond, 
you still have a lot of options, though I would not 
reccomend staying still for any time at all.  

Followups:
	- See Offense: Phoenix Position

l) 1+4_d+1+4: Left/Right Spinners (2/10)
	I do not use these moves at all.  It's too obvious 
and an inferior sidestep for advanced games.  It might work 
against scrubs, however...

Followups:
	- Strategy: Evasion - Premptive/Reactive

m) WS+2: Sunflower (4/10)
	With this move butchered as it is, offensively, it's 
not great.  It has a somewhat slow execution, and if it's 
blocked, Ling could be in trouble.

n) WS+4: Skyscraper Kick (7/10)
	Very fast execution, knockdown.  'Nuff said.

o) u/f_u_u/b+4: Cyanide (6/10)
	Occasional use move.  Best used when a low move is 
expected, but has funky execution.  On the bright side, you 
can go into her 10 strings from this move.  

p) u+1+2,2,1: Fortune Cookie (5/10)
	Alright move, decent priority, last move can be 
delayed, otherwise not very wise, doesn't string very well.  
Can also be sidestepped easily.  

q) f,f+1+2,1+2: Phoenix Wings (9/10)
	Another move who's usefulness has shown itself to me.
There is a guard stun after the second hit, which makes it 
incredibly good against people blocking.  This makes a really 
really good changeup game.  In addition, it does good damage, 
and tracks better than most people realize.  Also, the second 
hit I believe is guaranteed if the first connects.
	You can also use this without the second hit, after 
which you should do an immediate standing right kick, for 
a float into a Storming Palm.

Followups:

	- Bayonet (1,2)
	- Belly Chop (d/f+1)

	- Phoenix Wings (f,f+1+2,1+2)
	- Standing Right Kick (4)

r) f,f+3: Racoon Swing (7/10)
	A good general move to follow up any knockdown with.  
Also a good long range custom string starter.  Leaves you in 
Rain Dance, but the range from opponent will vary.  Use this 
to your advantage - Opponent will not understand usually.
Note: Do NOT overuse this move

Followups:
	- See Offense: Rain Dance
	- Spinner (u+3+4)

s) f,f+4: Step Kick (7/10)
	This is an occasional move to throw out, don't use 
it often, as it takes a bit to come out, during which Ling 
can get major countered.  However, the timing is kinda funky 
on it, so it may be miss interpreted by the opponent.  

Followups:
	- None

t) d/b+4: Nutcracker (5/10)
	Another occasional move, not great speed, poor range, 
but is her only normal stance low move.  Knocks opponent down 
face down, head towards Ling on counterhit.  
	Use when opponent is Turtling.

Followups:
	- See Offense: Custom Stringing
	- See Okizeme: Nutcracker

u) f, f+3+4: Front Layout (7/10)
	A move to use from further range.  Most people do not 
know how to deal with this move, and will fall prey to it, 
but if opponent catches on, cease all but the upmost prudent 
use - Ling can be in a lot of trouble otherwise.  On hit, the 
only guarenteed followup is usually a poke.  
	Also a good measure charging opponents.  

Followups:
	On Hit/Block:
		- Bayonet (1,2)
		- Front Kick (4)


	On Over Opponent:

*********************
OFFENSE WHILE DUCKING
*********************

	I'm just going to make a few comments in this section, 
as I feel it should be used only sparingly, as Ling is very 
vunerable when she does not move.  
	These moves should be used only in two main situations, 
that is 1) to regain the advantage through a low poke or WS move, 
or 2) inside of a custom string
	Waiting, immobile, ducking is like begging Mistress Nina 
to kick her in the teeth.  

v) FC+1 : Crouch Punch (8/10)
	Everyone has it, use it in custom strings, or when you 
feel you give the opponent too much of an advantage and they are 
attacking in close.

Followups:
	- See Strategy : Custom Strings

w) WS+2 : Sunflower (5/10)
	This move is butchered.  If you use it and they block, 
be sure your next move is a crouch punch, otherwise you're going 
to eat dirt.  Juggles ONLY on counterhit now, making it a shell 
of the move it once was.  

Followups:
	On Hit:
		- Crouch Punch (d+1)
	On Counter:
		- See Juggles : Sunflower

x) WS+4 : Skyscraper Kick (8/10) 
	VERY fast execution, decent recovery.  Knocks opponent 
over, with a Raccon Swing (f,f+3) okizeme possible.  Damage is 
small.  Good if you need a breather.  Tends to catch people.  

Followups:
	- Raccoon Swing (f,f+3)

y) d/df+4, {4} : Flower Garden (6/10)
	Same as from the Phoneix Position.  In fact, if you do 
only one, it leaves you in the Phoenix Position.  

Followups:
	- See Offense : Phoenix Position

z) d/df+2,1 : Lotus Twist (6/10)
	Okay move, doing only the first will leave you ducking 
in Rain Dance.  Okay for a suprise turn to Rain Dance, but not 
all that useful.  Careful, recovery is not great, especially if 
you miss.  

Followups:
	- None
	- See Offense : Rain Dance

aa) N, 1+3_2+4 : Stand n' Throw (8/10)
	Let go of the lever for a moment, and notice how fast 
Ling stands up.  Learn to buffer the throw, and it comes out 
like lightning.  

Followups:
	- See Okizeme : Throws


*********************
OFFENSE IN RAIN DANCE
*********************

	When Ling is in the Rain Dance, she has her best arsenal 
available, unfortunately, she is also somewhat vunerable.  Thus, 
the best way to play her with back turned is offensively, not 
giving the opponent a chance.

bb) Throw: Throw (8/10)
	Ling's throw while turned around is a very, very good 
move, and should be used whenever possible.  People will often 
have to choose between this and the mistrust (standing/ducking)  
If you can influence them correctly, you have it.
	There is 1 MAJOR danger with this, however.  If you 
whiff with her throw, Ling remains in Rain Dance and has MAJOR 
recovery time, which proves very, very deadly to the little girl.  

Followups:
	- See Okizeme: Throws

cc) 4: Mistrust (10/10)
	Mistrust -> Storming Palm is almost Ling's trademark move.  
This move is great, comes out with good speed, hits mid, juggles 
high, recovers with no penalty, and is impossible to see coming 
from the animation.  
	There is one downside, people expect this move, and thus 
will often wait for it.  However, used correctly, this can be 
easily turned to your advantage.  

Followups:
	- See Juggles: Mistrust

dd) 3: Turn Kick (8/10)
	This move is good in emergencies, or when you sense you're 
beginning to lose the advantage.  Coming out a few frames faster 
than the Mistrust, and having longer range, are it's only 
advantage over the move.  It hits High, so be careful on ducking 
opponents (you should Mistrust them anyways).

Followups:
	- None

ee) 2, 1, 4: Dark & Stormie -> Mistrust: (9/10)
	This canned string is nice, really nice.  The only 
disadvantage is that the first two hits hit high.  Luckily, if 
either of them hit on counter, and you use full speed on the rest, 
the rest is guaranteed.  
	The REAL strength of this move, though is that it can be 
delayed between both 2 and 3rd hits, and the last move canceled in 
favor of a throw, or even further, having the opponent eat a counter 
hit standing 4 -> Storming Palm.

Followups:
	- See Juggles: Mistrust

ff) 2: Stormie (6/10)
	This move is her jab when turned around.  Hits high, and is 
basically a setup move, forcing the opponent to react.  Reccomended 
for prudent use, and not to be overused, as opponent may duck and 
hurt you.  

Followups:
	- See Offense: Rain Dance

gg) SS: Sidestep (9/10)
	Ling's backward sidestep is a great offensive move.  It 
often causes opponents to react, or miss, leaving Ling ready with a 
mistrust or throw, though the former is usually preferable, and 
safer.  

Followups:
	- Mistrust (4)
	- Throw
	- Dark & Stormie -> Mistrust (2,1,4)

hh) b+3+4: Roll Ball (8/10)
	A great move when you end up Rain Dance at medium distance 
to opponent, and creates a great confusion game.  The move puts you 
in the opponent's face with Ling in Rain Dance (always a good thing).  
After this, you can do any rain dance tactics, especially a throw or 
mistrust (forcing a duck/not duck game).

Followups:
	- Mistrust (4)
	- Throw
	- Delay, Rain Dance Tactic

ii) f+3+4,3+4: Cyclone (9/10)
	A move to be used during times of retribution from opponent.  
Ling goes down into the roll ball, and then kicks up with both feet, 
creating a far juggle, and doing good damage.  The move is fairly 
quick, but the real advantage lies in that she goes under a lot of 
attacks during the animation.  Also, this creates more confusion, if 
used in conjunction with the roll ball.  
	If this move is blocked, you have more advantage that the 
opponent often thinks.  The best followup is another Cyclone, as 
opponent will often try to hit her after a block (I fall for this 
tactic more often than I'd like to admit, despite the fact that I 
know it and use it myself).  

Followups:
	- See Juggles: Cyclone

jj) f,f+3+4: Back Layout (9/10)
	A great move for medium range.  It's got among the best 
priority in the game, stuns on hit and counterhit for a guarunteed 
juggle, and she is safe for almost the entire move.  It's simply 
overpowering.  
	This move good/bad against large characters, the nice thing 
is that if she does it close enough to opponent, it will hit the 
opponent with an unblockable on the way up, and then another time 
on the way down, and you can get a 1 hit juggle with an immediate 
Mistrust most of the time (this does excellent damage, by the way).  
The bad thing is that if it hits large opponents with the down hit 
only, it often hits too early to get the automatic Mistrust juggle.  

Followups:
	- Mistrust (4)
	- Throw

kk) d/f+2: Crouch Punch (6/10)
	This move is ultra fast, and is used primarily if you want 
to custom string Ling between Rain Dance and normal stance or as 
a defense, because of it's speed.  Not really that special, just 
a crouch punch.  

Followups:
	- See Offense: Custom Stringing

ll) d+3: Back Circle Breaker (6/10)
	Good move for turtling opponents who like to back out of 
throw range of Ling.  Hits low and gives you the advantage.  
Also, if you hold D, Ling will return to Normal Stance.

Followups:
	- See Offense: Rain Dance

mm) f,f+3: Peg Leg (6/10)
	This move is good if you can get it off.  It has a bit of 
lag at the beginning, and for some reason, against me tends to be 
countered a lot by King (go figure).  The real advantage of this 
is the advantage game it plays.  Ling has no lag on block, and 
so has an illusionary disadvantage, which temps opponents to attack 
almost 95% of the time.  Remember: getting opponents to attack is 
Ling's perogative.

Followups:
	- Cyclone (b+3+4,3+4)
	- Sidestep

nn) f,f+(1+3_2+4): Hop 'n Throw (7/10)
	Another good move to use at close or medium range, and 
when opponent is not actively attacking Ling.  The move itself is 
one of Ling's most deceptive, as she hops, waves her arms wildly, 
making it look like an attack, and then lands to throw the opponent.  
Most people can't deal with this move, even if they know it and have 
fought against it.  
	Also, this move can be used to counter low attacks against 
Ling as she hops over them.  This move earns you great style points 
with observers.
	Be very careful, though.  This move has horrid recovery on 
whiff.  

Followups:
	- See Okizeme: Throws

***************************
OFFENSE IN PHOENIX POSITION
***************************

oo) 4~3 : Firecracker (8/10)
	A good move, fairly fast, and plays a great changeup game 
with the Wave Crests.  Best pulled immediately after going into 
Phoenix Position.  Doesn't do the best damage, but does knock the 
opponent down.  
	Careful, though.  On block, Ling is grounded, but in slide 
position, meaning she can be picked up by some moves.  

Followups:
	- None

pp) 1+2_d+1+2_d,1+2 : Wave Crests (9/10)
	Great juggle starters, with variable speed depending on 
the input.  Not incredibly punishable on block either.  It's best 
to input a chicken, however, as some players wait for this move.  

Followups:
	- See Juggles: Wave Crest

qq) 1_2 : Handful Left_Right (6/10)
	A quick poke, leaves Ling in a sort of half ducking, half 
standing position.  However, this means that a WS move is possible 
fairly quickly afterwards.  Reccomend WS+2 if you are sure of a 
counter, WS+4 otherwise.

Followups:
	- See Offense: Normal Stance

rr) u+4,{4} : Flower Power (6/10)
	This move is okay to keep you on the offense, but is risky, 
especially if you do the second one because the opponent definately 
has the advantage.  Usually, after I do two of them, I will immediately 
throw out an attack parry (this actually works almost 70% of the time).  
	Otherwise, it is wise to just block, as you are likely going to 
eat any move the opponent gives you.  Another option is to go 
immediately into the Phoenix Position, but it is more risky, as for 
some reason, TTT doesn't like to take buffered directional commands and 
buttons together for some reason.  Also, it is slower, and Ling may 
take a counter to the face.  
	If you do NOT use the second flower power, you have really two 
options: recover ducking and go from there, or hold U when you input 
the first move, and end in Rain Dance.  The second is only good because 
of it's suprise factor, as Ling has a disadvantage when doing this.  

Followups:
	- See Above

ss) f+4,{4} : Flower Garden (5/10)
	Use this only in very close, as the range is very small.  If 
you do two, you end up ducking with an illusionary disadvantage.  This 
is caused by the speed that her WS+4 comes out (use WS+2 if you're 
gutsy, and be sure to chicken either one!).  
	If you don't do the second, you're left in the Phoenix 
Position, Go from there.  

Followups:
	- See Above

tt) f+3+4 : Roll Ball (6/10)
	A move that would be best used at far range, but unfortunatly 
doing so give the opponent time to hit you, and so it should not be 
used as such.  Better used at medium to close range, as a confusion 
tactic, as it leaves you in ducking stance, which is not optimum for 
a Ling assault.  

Followups:
	- WS+4
	- WS+2
	- Phoenix Position
	- Side Step

uu) f+(1+3_2+4), {d} : Cradle Throw (7/10)
	This move is good for an escape... sometimes.  It's actually 
slower than it looks in getting off of the oppponent's axis, so be 
wary in using it to avoid hits.  Out of this move, you can either 
throw or tap down to cancel the throw and recover crouching 
(reccomended).  Most people will duck the throw, leaving you open, 
so be careful in using it.  In addition, in TTT, the throw seems to 
track worse than it did in 3,

	- See Offense: Ducking

***************************
OFFENSE IN HYPNOTIST STANCE
***************************

	When Ling is in the Hypnotist Stance, she can do almost 
anything she can in the normal position.  With this in mind, use 
it as a scare tactic, making them think you are vunerable, or 
are going to come out with 1 of the two moves from this stance, 
of which I rarely use.  Throws are highly encouraged.  
	During this stance, Ling will take 4 steps, ending ON 
the forth (not after).  After each step, the damage (and lag in 
beginning for the Spin Sticker) will increase.  Note: you can 
restart the Hypnotist stance by pressing B+1+2.
	This move is utilized better in sidestepping tactics 
with Ling.  

vv) 2 : Spin Sticker (7/10)
	This move sidesteps and ducks Ling before coming out, 
and sends Opponent flying on connect.  Follow with a charge.  
Not highly reccomended because people expect it too much.  

Followups:
	- Charge!

ww) 1+2 : Thunder Strike (3/10)
	Ling's unblockable is decent in damage, she ducks in 
execution, it tracks like a SOB and has deceptively long range
but yet does NOT connect with any regularity.  Don't ask me 
why, perhaps I don't utilize it correctly.  
	Not reccomended, people can step away in time or 
duck punch her out of it, giving them the advantage.  

Followups:
	- None


**************************
OFFENSIVE CHARGING TACTICS
**************************

	The charge is a great offensive tactic for Ling, but 
at the same time, high risk.  It is important not to be too 
forward in TTT about charging in general, because there are 
many more options for avoidance/payback than there were in 3.  
	The most common mistake is to get too close to the 
opponent before executing your move, this can be extremely 
fatal, so watch your step!

xx) 4 : Slide (9/10)
	I use this by far the most often.  Even advanced 
players fall for it time after time, expecting a frontal 
attack or throw.  Gives you a chance for a followup sweep 
as well, or, if the opponent immediately tags out, you can 
sweep juggle the newcommer.  

Followups:
	- Play by Ear

yy) 3 : Jump Kick (8/10)
	I use this only when people have been blocking the 
slide as a followup.  It's got very little range, and for 
some reason people duck when they see the animation, 
expecting to duck it.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work that 
way.  A little bit more risky than the slide.

Followups:
	- None

zz) 1+2 : Flying Cross Chop (7/10)
	Even more risky, as it takes more time to come out, 
sometimes allowing the opponent to hit you first.  I use it 
for far opponents, especially large ones, because it sometimes 
hits them even if they're grounded.  

aaa) N : Shoulder Charge (6/10)
	Unblockable, but takes a LOT of time to get going, you 
also may get hit first, which makes it difficult to pull off.  

Followups:
	- None

bbb) N : Ultimate Tackle (4/10)
	I don't use this very often, as it's too risky in TTT.  
Ling really doesn't do much damage with her little slaps, 
anyways, so it's not worth it in my opinion.  Plus, it can be 
countered.

Followups:
	- Slaps (1_2 x 5)

ccc) N : Body Stomp (6/10)
	Good move usually.  This only occurs when the opponent 
is lying down.  Fairly safe, unless you give the opponent too 
much time to recover, in which case you can be low swept.  

Followups: 
	- None

ddd) Stop Short, Sidestep (8/10)
	Defensive manuver, puts Ling into position to make an 
attack.  Use any of Lings evasive sidesteps from her basic, to 
the cartwheel, to the back turn.  Change it up!


eee) d/b+1 : Storming Palm (7/10)
	A good one because the timing is a little odd the 
opponent may try to hit you as you run in, but this move will 
usually out prioritize his move if done correctly.  
	Best part about it: on counter, you get to charge 
again!

Followups:
	- Charge!

fff) f,f+1+2,f+1+2 : Phoenix Wings (6/10)
	Quite risky, but has lots of possibilities for 
devistating damage to the opponent.  If this move out 
prioritizes, he takes a good 30+ Points.  On counter hit it's 
more.  If the SECOND hit is on counter, you get a float from 
which you can do a small juggle or a Storming Palm (d/f+1)

Followups:
	- F+4
	- Charge!
	- d/f+1
	- Throw

ggg) Stop Short, Front Layout (6/10)
	A little risky.  If the opponent does a long move, 
you will be back to back with them, but if they recover too 
fast, they'll kick you out of the air before you land behind 
them.  Best followup is a Cyclone.  

Followups:
	- Cyclone (f+3+4,3+4)
	- See Tactics : Behind Opponent

hhh) Throw : (4/10)
	This is one time in which it is NOT reccomended to 
throw.  The charge gives people too much time to see you 
coming, and will more than likely hit you before you get a 
chance.

*******
OKIZEME
*******
	Okizeme is, put simply, "Hitting the opponent while he's down."
Some call it cheap (scrubs, no good players), but it's a great way to 
add damage to Ling's game, especially because many of her moves offer 
such great opportunities to do so, and are damaging.  So, without 
further ado...

*****************
OKIZEME - GENERAL
*****************
	Ling's okizeme is best used exclusively at close range, like 
most peoples.  It is often uncertain (as well as unwise), to hit far 
ranged opponents lying on the ground by charging in and doing a move, 
because 9 times out of 10, they will out prioritize you.  The only 
somewhat "safe move" in this situation being the Racoon Swing (f,f+3).

I use the following codes for the Okizeme section:
[D] - Good damage
[d] - Poor damage
[F] - Good Followups
[f] - Poor (or no) Followups
[P] - Good Position is gained by the move
[p] - Poor Position after execution
[S] - Usually a safe move
[s] - Fairly unsafe move
[H] - Usually Hits
[h] - Hitting is Risky

* If not noted otherwise, moves are somewhere in the neurtral range.  

a) d/f+2,1 : Sunrise Fan (9/10) [DF...]
	This move is AWSOME against grounded opponents.  It comes out 
with good speed, hits several times, and does good damage.  However, 
it does not work well UNLESS the opponent is sideways from Ling.  
Doing so otherwise will hit the opponent 1-2 times, and give them a 
major advantage.  Good followup is Racoon Swing (f,f+3) to Back Circle 
Breaker ((RD) d+3)
	There is one danger in this move, in that the opponent may 
quick rise to block it.  This situation is covered in Strategy : Ling's 
Tricks.  

Best used when:
	- Opponent is on his side, and refuses to move OR has just 
been knocked down.

Followups:
	- Tag -> Slide [.fpS.]

	Opponent Rolls (likely):
		- Racoon Swing (f,f+3) 	  [dFPSH]
		- Phoenix Wings (f,f+1+2) [D..sh]

	Opponent Stays:
		- Fire Dancer ((FC),3) 	  [D.p.h]
		- Racoon Swing (f,f+3)    [dFPSH]

b) d/b+4 :  (5/10) [.F.S.]
	Okay move, fairly safe if done right away, and you want to 
stay in front stance.  Has poor range, though, allowing it to miss 
if you're too far.  Not bad if the opponent is rolling towards you 
either, because it leads to more followup opportunities.

Best used when:
	- Opponent rolls towards you, and you aren't ducking.
	- Opponent lies still, with feet or head towards Ling

Followups:
	Opponent Stays:
		- Racoon Swing (f,f+3) 	  [dFPSH]

	Opponent Rolls:
		- Racoon Swing (f,f+3) 	  [dFPSH]
		- Phoenix Wings (f,f+1+2) [D..sh]
		- Step Kick (f,f+4) 	  [D.P.h]
		- Fire Dancer ((FC),3)    [D.p.h]

c) d/b+3 : Knee Cracker (5/10) [d.PSH]
	This move is not bad as a confusion tactic, as it will often 
cause the opponent to flinch, allowing you to do a number of things.  
Note: this move does NO damage, it's only nudges the opponent.

Best Used When: 
	- Opponent is sideways
	- Opponent just starting a move (possible float)

Followups:
	Opponent Stays:
		- Racoon Swing (f,f+3) 	  [dFPSH]
		- Nut Cracker (d/b+4) 	  [.F.S.]
		- Sunrise Fan (d/f+2,1)   [DF...]

	Opponent Rolls:
		- Racoon Swing (f,f+3) 	  [dFPSH]
		- Phoenix Wings (f,f+1+2) [D..sh]
		- Step Kick (f,f+4) 	  [D.P.h]
		- Fire Dancer ((FC),3) 	  [D.p.h]

d) FC+3,{2...} : Fire Dancer (7/10) [Dfp.h]
	This move has the potential for the most damage of any of 
Ling's Okizeme, as it goes directly to her standard Juggle.  
Unfortunately, it's hard to hit with on a wary opponent.  Keep in 
mind that some of her longer combos will miss the last move from 
this juggle, as it is slightly lower than her standard starters.  

Best Used when:
	- You block a slide attack, or Opponent is Short.
	- Opponent does a move that grounds him in front of your 
	  face.
	- You can anticipate a roll forwards or backwards

Followups:
	Opponent Juggles:
		- See Juggles : Fire Dancer
	Otherwise:
		- No followups possible

e) f,f+3+4 : Back Layout (6/10) [..P..]
	This move has a specialized use for long range Okizeme.  
Use it sparingly, though, as it can be seen coming.  The advantage 
is that the opponent on the ground will often take incorrect steps 
to avoid being hit by this move, either leaving him standing or 
on the ground after being hit.

Best Used when:
	- Opponent is at medium distance, recently grounded.

Followups:
	Opponent is Hit on Ground:
		Opponent Rolls:
			- Racoon Swing (f,f+3) 	  [dFPSH]
			- Phoenix Wings (f,f+1+2) [D..sh]
			- Fire Dancer ((FC),3) 	  [D.p.h]

		Opponent Stays:			
			- Racoon Swing (f,f+3) 	  [dFPSH]

f) f,f+3 : Racoon Swing (10/10) [dFPSH]
	Okay, this move gets a 10/10 because of the following 
reasons: 1) It's almost a guarunteed hit 2) It ends back turned 
3) there are good, and (almost) guarunteed followups 4) It's a 
pretty safe move.
	If you notice, this move is part of most of my Okizeme 
tactics, putting me in position to begin with the next attack.  
However, if opponent is rising when this move connects, be SURE 
you IMMEDIATELY sidestep.  If you don't, at worse, you'll 
probably take a single hit to the back.  

Best Used when:
	- Just about any time at all (while opponent is on the 
	  ground)

Followups:
	- Back Circle Breaker ((RD) d+3) 	  [d.PSH]
	- Peg Leg ((RD) f,f+3) 			  [D.Psh]

f) (RD) d+3 : Back Circle Breaker (8/10) [d.PSH]
	This move is almost guaranteed after the Racoon Swing 
(f,f+3) if executed immediately, and is if the opponent happened 
to be rolling when they were hit.  The damage is negligable, but 
this move is an inportant part in a great little attack pattern 
Ling has.  

Best Used When:
	- Following Racoon Swing (f,f+3) [dFPSH]

Followups:
	- See Strategy : Ling's Tricks

g) (RD) f,f+3 : Peg Leg (7/10) [D.Psh]
	This move, to be honest, almost NEVER hits if the opponent 
does anything but just sit there.  So why do I give it a 7 rating, 
you ask?  See Strategy : Ling's Tricks for the answer.

****************
OKIZEME - THROWS
****************

	The main reasons Ling's throwing game is so deadly is that 
there are very good Okizeme followups.  Learn to use these, and you 
can REALLY punish the opponent.  Indeed: this a major part of Ling's 
fgame, in my opinion.  

---
Front Throws - Jade (1+3) and Ruby (2+4)
---

	After both of Ling's front throws, there is a very good 
followup: Sunrise Fan (d/f+2,1).  Follow up with anything you 
wish.  
	There is 1 pitfall, however.  This move CAN be blocked, 
but it is very difficult to do.  For people who DO know how to 
block it, however, there is a trick...

- See Strategy : Ling's Tricks

----
Side Throws - Dump the Bucket (Right), Arm Flip (Left)
----
	Ling's Right throw (Dump the Bucket) doesn't really give 
you much of an option for good Okizeme.  The best you can hope 
for is if you do an immediate Phoenix Wings (f,f+1+2,1+2), you 
can sometimes catch them if they're doing rising kick or sweep.  
It's risky business, though.  

	Ling's Left throw (Arm Flip) on the other hand, is an 
incredibly good thing.  See Ling's Tricks for details.  

- See Strategy : Ling's Tricks

---
Back Throw - Crank Up
---
	Aside from doing really nice damage for a character who 
can get back throws as often as Ling does, it also has a very good 
possibility for an immediate Juggle afterwards.  
	The trick is this (will be recapped in Strategy : Ling's 
Tricks) :
	Immediately after Ling's Crank Up back throw, duck, and 
wait for any sign of a flinch from the opponent.  Most people think 
that because of the range, they are safe from her by rolling back... 
but Ling has incredibly long legs for such a tiny Chinese girl, 
and her little juggling sweep can still catch them most of the time.  
	When they move, hit 3, 2 and Juggle!


***************
GROUND RECOVERY
***************
	Ling actually has fewer options than most people from the 
ground.  She can't perform the normal b,b+3+4, or f,f+1+2 moves like 
most people can.  This means you have to be somewhat more prudent.  
	HOWEVER, Ling does have 1 thing in particular that in all 
likelyhood, more than makes up for it: She can juggle opponents while 
she herself is on the ground!
	The move in question is simply her Rising Low Sweep (3) and 
followed immediately by the Fire Dancer (d+3) into a rain dance combo.

Note: this juggle is a bit lower than most of her others, and thus, 
if you try to put a Phoenix Wings (f,f+1+2,1+2) on the end, you will
more than likely miss (but not always!).  

	As a result, I tend to use rising kick moves a lot more than 
I would with other characters when using Ling.  This can occcasionaly 
get me into trouble with people who anticipate it, but wins me a lot 
of damage, so I live with it.  
	The best time to use the sweep is on people who use careless 
Okizeme tactics against you.  The move is fast, very fast, so you 
can get it in a lot, but beware of low blockers.  Reccomend to mix 
it with her Rising High Kick (4) if you're unsure.
	Other than that, use quick recoveries, rolls, etc. as you 
would with other characters.

*****************
TAGGING WITH LING
*****************

	In TTT, Tagging in and out safely is no less an important 
skill than knowing your character.  Doing so unsafely will result 
in many spent Quarters (or 100 Yen pieces, depending where you are).  
	Ling has a few advantages when tagging that other players 
don't, so it's important to learn them and use them to your 
advantage.

********************
TAGGING IN WITH LING
********************

	Ling's entering moves are standard, that is, she has the 
Slide (f,f,N+4), the Head Dive (f,f,N+1+2), the Jump Kick (f,f,N+3), 
and the Run Cancel->Backflip (u/b,b).  
	I will not explain the use of these moves individually, as 
they are well known and you should be able to determine when they 
should be used.  I will instead suggest moves from Ling's arsenal 
to use when entering.  

a) d+1+2 : Phoenix Position (9/10)
	This is a GREAT move, as long as you don't overuse it.  
It's suprises people who want to hit you as you come in, as it makes 
thier attacks whiff.  Follow up with a quick Wave Crest (~1+2).  If 
you misjudge, and the enemy doesn't attack immediately, follow up 
with a Firecracker (4~3) or another Rain Dance Tactic.  
	Use on aggressive opponents attempting to hit you 
immediately on entry.

Followups:
	- Wave Crests (1+2)
	- Firecracker (4~3)

b) d/b+1 : Storming Palm (7/10)
	This one is great when done well, but is only good in 
situations where the opponent is either recovering close to the 
side of the screen, or is attempting to attack you, but is attacking 
you towards the end of your run.  This will out prioritise them, and 
likely counterhit.  But be wary.

Followups:
	- Running Charge

c) SS_b+3+4_f+1+2_f+3+4 : Sidestep, Rain Dance, Cartwheel, Leap Right
   (7/10)
	These are good if the opponent is not on top of you when you 
come in, or is attacking you with really bad latancy when you come in.  
	Be careful if the opponent has already begun a move, though.  
With the cartwheel and Leap right, you will probably not completely 
avoid an attack, but the damage will be much less.  With the Sidestep 
and Rain Dance, you might get nailed if you're too close.

Followups:
	- See Tactics : Evasion Reactive

d) Throw : (7/10)
	This move is good on an "indecisive" opponent.  If they're not 
attacking, they'll probably expect an immediate attack, so run up and 
grab them immediately.

*********************
TAGGING OUT WITH LING
*********************

	There's really no extra trick to tagging out with Ling in 
comparison with any other character.  I will now go over methods of 
tagging out.  

e) 2+5 : Tag Throw (8/10)
	Tag throws are a great option for her, because of her speed 
and ability to make people eat them.  Although, sometimes the prospect 
of getting close to an opponent while low on life is sometimes 
daunting.

f) (RD) 4~5 : Mistrust [Tag] (5/10)
	This is not bad if you happen to be in the position where you 
can use this move to tag out, great: more power to you.  Unfortunately, 
it requires her to go to the trouble of getting into the Rain Dance, 
which is dangerous if she is low on life.  It's more of a risky manuver 
than I like to take considering how low her stamina is.  Good juggle 
starter, however.  

g) (PP) d+1+2~5 : Wave Crest - Power [Tag] (5/10)
	The wave crests are tagable, but this option is brought down for 
a couple of reasons:
1 - Ling CAN NOT tag out while in the Phoenix Position - a fact 
that has flustered me once or twice in a game - making this position 
somewhat dangerous while low on life.
2 - If the opponent blocks, or you miss, you lose the round.
	On the up side: you get a good juggle if you connect.  

h) (PP) 4~3,5 : Firecracker, Tag (8/10)
	This move makes you go into the Phoenix Position, but the 
move itself has a much lower chance of being blocked, allowing you to 
tag out safely, and tag in RELATIVELY safely as well.  The opponent 
will be grounded, or rising when your partner comes in.  

i) d+2,1~5 : Sunrise Fan (5/10)
	This move is a DANGEROUS one to use.  The move itself, if 
connected, insures a safe exit and entry for your team from the front 
position.  Unfortunately, the penalty for failure, is death, as the 
recovery time for this move is enough for any medium speed juggle 
starter.  You also might be able to juggle SOMETHING off of this.  

j) WS+2 : Sunflower (3/10)
	This has about a 25% chance of you surviving.  Unless you 
feel lucky - little girl - don't use it to tag out.  You get almost 
no chance of a juggle, anyways.  

k) 1,2_d/f+1,WC+1_4 : Poking tactics (8/10)
	This is my usual way of tagging out if an opportunity is 
not immediately obvious.  Basically, I do a small poking move, and 
tag out after a connect.  This often causes a retaliation move that 
will most time miss your partner coming in (but not always!), thus 
give you a juggle starting opportunity.  

******************
JUGGLING WITH LING
******************

	Ling is a very good juggler - better than most people think.  
Her juggle do decent (not Mishima level, but very good) damage, and 
can be extremely long.  Unfortunately, her Juggle starters are not 
as good as say, EWGF, but they do the job.
	A lot of your game should be centered around an occasional 
Juggle.  


********
STARTERS
********

a) (RD) 4 : Mistrust (10/10)
	This is Ling's signature starter.  It juggles high, and 
allows almost all of her juggles.  Comes out fast, Highly 
reccomended.

b) ~1+2_1+2_d+1+2 : Wave Crests (7/10)
	This is a good juggle starter.  It's impossible to hit an 
unaware person with, but works great on countering other attacks.  
The d+1+2 version is a Class 1 starter, and is her highest.  

c) WS+2 : Sunflower (5/10)
	As a juggle starter, no.  This move is unreliable unless 
you're ducking under a string and know you can get a counterhit.  
I would give up the Sunrise Fan (d/f+2,1) to have this move back 
in full.  

d) d/f+2,1 : Sunrise Fan (8/10)
	A new move to TTT, this is the best improvement they've 
given her (though not enough for what they took away).  It 
juggles head towards Ling, which SEVERELY limits her options, 
but it does it's job nonetheless.  

*******
JUGGLES
*******
	Okay, this is by no means the end all of juggles for Ling, 
and I intend to update this section once tekken.net gets around to 
listing them.
	For those who doubt Ling's juggle ability, I ask them to 
compare them to, say, Jin's Laser scraper combos.  Ling's will 
usually do more.  In fact, Ling's better Juggles will do from 1/3 
to 1/2 (on Kali) of the opponent's life bar.  This is by no means 
weak in any fashion.  
	Note, [***] Indicates a good damage combo.

	Also note that all of these juggles have not been tested, 
ESPECIALLY in the Sunrise Fan category.  I have a number of sources 
for these juggles, as well as personal experience.
	They are as follows:

Mistrust Juggles

	Ling's best Juggle starter for many reasons.  From this 
move she can do close to her most damaging juggles.

The juggle I almost always use is:
	Mistrust -> d/f+1, 2, 2~1, f,f+1+2.
However, I will occasionally go for just
	Mistrust -> d/b+1
if I know the person will die, or if I'm running out of 
time with my Kali.

Wave Crest Juggles
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
	With the wave crest Quick and Normal, you can do 
most of the Mistrust followups minus the f+4 and d/b+1.  
Keep in mind that fewer of the (RD) 2,{2}... are 
reccomended to get the end of the juggle off.
	The wave crest Power is Ling's highest launcher,
and allows for a few extra juggles.  Any of her Mistrust 
Juggles are good, but there a few additional Juggles that 
should be added.

Wave Crest - Quick ( (PP) ~1+2 ) ->

	Both of the above juggles ending with f,f+1+2 are 
fairly difficult, but worth the effort if you can get them.

Sunflower Juggles
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
	Though toned down, this move is still a nice 
juggle starter on counter.  It basically puts you into the

plus a bit more.

STRATEGY
********
	In this section, I will go into the basic, 
and intricate strategy of playing Ling.  These 4 strategies 
are the main ways in which I have found effective to use 
Ling.  
	Certain stratagies are better against certain kinds 
of opponent, as well as specific characters.  This will be 
discussed in detail at a later date.  
	In General, Ling is at her peak against offensive 
characters - ESPECIALLY pitbulls.  Turtles are generally 
her weakness, with every other type of style somewhere in 
between.  Another type of person to fear is the person who 
knows Ling well - they are the people who can punish you 
after certain moves where Ling is vunerable (they exist in 
more places than people think).  More on this later.  

*******************
EVASION - PREMPTIVE
*******************
Name : 			Schoolgirl's Temprement (jyoshikousei 
			no seikaku)
Best Used Against : 	Low-HighAverage Level Pitbulls, 
			Turtlers.
Effectiveness :		7/10
Fun Factor :		10/10
Strengths :		Allow you to avoid attacks all
			together if used right.  Is fun as 
			hell and taunting to your opponent.
			Evasion often coinsides with an enemy's 
			reprisal, leaving Ling in prime position.  
Weaknesses :		If you make a mistake, you can 
			be punished for it.  High level 
			players will not fall for it as 
			often.  
Primary Purpose: 	Confuse the enemy, provoking them 
			into making mistakes by attacking 
			Ling while she is sidestepping, thus 
			giving you opportunity for side/back 
			throws or juggle starters.

	Basically, this is Ling as she was ment to be played.  
Unfortunately, due to many of the changes made to Ling since 
Tekken 3, this option has been taken away from her at higher 
level play (mainly due to the fact that the Mistrust now does 
a head-over-heels knockdown instead of juggle when done behind 
the opponent).  
	In this strategy, you will use a lot of Sidesteps, 
Rain Dance back turns, Spinners, Cartwheels and Leaps.  To mix 
it up, you should also use the Phoenix and Hypnotist Positions.  
	The main trick is to keep moving, and to watch your 
opponents actions carefully.  When in doubt, sidestep, when not 
in doubt, sidestep: it's the name of the game.  There are a few 
reactions that the typical opponent will have to this:

1) Opponent continually turtles while backing up
	This is the most annoying type of reaction, and one that 
you really have very little control over.  If the opponent 
continuously does this, you should 
a) Front or sidestep Throw them
b) Use her Knee cracker (d/b+3), Nutcracker (d/b+4), or 
   Firecracker ((PP) 4~3) to break thier block, and encourage 
   some reprisal.
c) Use her Roll Ball ((PP) f+3+4) and California Roll 
   ((RD) f+3+4) and changeup with Throw/Mistrust (Risky)
d) Use her Back Layout ((RD) f,f+3+4) from in close.  If the 
person continues to back up, he'll be in trouble, even if he 
doesn't, if you make it up in the air, Ling should be safe.  

2) They try to pitbull you
	Switch to reactive evation (you'll beat them soon).

3) Opponent Turtles, without backing up
	This is easy to counter, as if they don't back up, 
thier axis fails to change despite thier ducking.  You can 
mistrust them or throw them from the side.

4) Opponent will Turtle with intent to bait you into coming 
   near.  
	This is the most common reaction, and the best trick 
is to beat them at thier own game.  
	You can do this by making false approaches, and using 
confusion tactics like the Left and Right Spinners (d+3+4, 3+4).  
These are only needed for excessively conservative opponents, 
who have proven themselves to be good at avoiding Ling tactics, 
and should be very carefully given out.  
	Usually, people who try this will fail against a clever 
Ling player, unless they have extensive experience against her.  
	I usually mix this tactic with Poking : Instigation.  

Primary Moves:

Avoidance:
	- Sidestep (SS)
	- Cartwheel Left (f+1+2)
	- Leap Right (f+3+4)

******************
EVASION - REACTIVE
******************
Name : 			Maiden's Prerogative (otome no tokken)
Best Used Against : 	Low-High Level Pitbulls
Effectiveness :		9/10
Fun Factor :		7/10
Strengths :		Makes your opponent miss you 
			completely, setting you up for 
			painful retribution opportunities.  
Weaknesses :		Moves that track, 360 Degree axis 
			moves, slow reaction on the part of the 
			Ling player can all MAJORLY punish her 
			while using this.  
Primary Purpose: 	Lings most damaging method of play 
			if done correctly, allows you to 
			really do damage.

	The main difference between this and premptive 
evasion is the fact that you don't use as much of the 
outgoing Ling moves to begin with, but do more of a give 
and take game, with occasional Sidestep, Cartwheel (f+1+2), 
Rain Dance (b+3+4), or Phoenix Position (d+1+2).
	This is the primary method I use, as people don't 
know as much about Ling's frontal arsenal as her back-
turned.  As a result, people seem to underestimate her, 
and it adds more variety to her game.  In fact, unlike 
most people who play Ling, I tend to use her front game 
more than her back, and use the Rain Dance mostly for 
specific purposes such as changeups, stringing and 
juggling.  

Primary Moves:

Avoidance:
	- Sidestep (SS)
	- Cartwheel Left (f+1+2)

POKING - INSTIGATION
********************
Name : 			Teasing the Teacher (Sensei wo ijimeru)
Best Used Against : 	Fast characters, or those with 
			Linear or High moves
Effectiveness :		7/10
Fun Factor :		9/10
Strengths :		Can set you up for some good damage
			counters and juggles.
Weaknesses :		You may eat a move with higher 
			priority.
Primary Purpose: 	Another method of setting opponent 
			up in order to retaliate.  
	
	This strategy is about as defensive as Ling gets.  
The idea is to use nothing but small, fast pokes and 
occasional evasion tactics to safely do damage to the enemy.  
It's basically a back and forth tactic, changing from offense 
to defense and back again - something Ling is very good at, 
though not the MOST effective way to play her.  Note, although 
you should use pokes often, it does not keep you from going 
for an occasional powerful move or juggle starter.  More often 
than not, you will be forced into this strategy by better 
players, so it's important to learn.
	I use this rarely by choice, as there are usually better 
ways to beat the enemy.  It can be, however, EXTREMELY annoying 
to the opponent when you poke thier life away from every move 
they do.  
	The primary requisites are extremely fast pokes, and 
small damage strings, with an occasional throw if the opponent 
opens themselves up too much.  If he flinches, throw out a 
poke.  If he stands there, go over and poke them or throw them, 
or juggle them with a Sunrise Fan (d/f+2,1) when they duck.  
	The whole idea of play is basically a back and forth 
strategy, with capitalization on slow moves that can be stopped 
with small pokes.  
	The Bayonet (1,2) is your primary weapon, it's tied for 
the fastest move in the game, and is almost always a great 
followup to moves that recover at fast to medium speed (anything 
more, and you should juggle or throw them).  It's also good if 
you can see a move coming before it comes out (i.e. double 
forward tap moves).  Better yet is the Standing Right Kick (4), 
as it's almost as fast as the Bayonet (albeit 2 frames), and 
on counterhit, floats with a Storming Palm (d/b+1) followup 
for very good damage.

******************
POKING - STRINGING
******************
Name : 			Wrath of the Schoolgirl (jyoshikousei 
			no hageshii ikari)
Best Used Against : 	Slow Characters, especially those with 
			no good pokes.  Turtles.  
Effectiveness :		7/10
Fun Factor :		7/10
Strengths :		Does not give opponents a chance to 
			react, or will score counterhits for 
			good damage when they try to retaliate.
Weaknesses :		You may eat a move with higher priority.
			Chickens are often difficult to buffer.
			Damage is not that great compared to 
			other methods usually.  
Primary Purpose: 	Keep the pressure on the opponent so that 
			he can't react, useful especially as the 
			opponent is tagging out, to be prepared 
			for the entrance of the partner.  

	Ling's custom strings are EXCELLENT.  She's probably among 
the best in the game in this area.  Her moves are fast, most have 
quick recovery, and add up to damage when you use them to work in 
a throw or juggle starter.  
	I do have use some standard strings in my repitoire, mostly 
because they have worked so well for me consistantly.  On my better 
days, I tend to do something I call "Random Stringing."
	Basically, this can be done with the faster characters that 
one knows very, VERY well.  The trick is to start a string, and not 
really think about what you're next move will be (because doing so 
will cause you to go to your standard stringing techniques).  This 
makes for extremely hard-to-predict strings.  If you're on, it works 
like a charm.  If you're not, you'll get nailed.  I usually have 
my best streaks when my strings are sufficiently random.  
	Other things to work into this is an occasional sidestep, 
possibly changing to the Poking - Instigation occasionally, as these 
two styles work together very well with Ling, because the opponent 
won't know if he's being baited or not.
	Often the best poke is the poke that the opponent thinks is 
coming, but doesn't - it usually confuses the opponent, at which 
point, panic moves come out; Moves often inappropriate against 
Ling.

**************
CUSTOM STRINGS
**************
	Here I will list all of the common strings I 
pull off with Ling, and attempt to show some of the 
possible options she has from any position.  Remember: 
this list is not exhaustive, as I believe that would 
be close to impossible, so don't use these strings 
exclusively, try random stringing to see what you come 
up with!
Note: I am Forgoing the move names at this stage as a 
      space-saving device.

I use the following codes for the String section:
[D] - Good damage (or potential off a juggle or Okizeme)
[d] - Poor damage
[F] - Good Followups
[f] - Poor (or no) Followups
[P] - Good Position is gained by the move
[p] - Poor Position after execution
[S] - Usually a safe move
[s] - Fairly unsafe move
[H] - Usually Hits (whether opponent blocks or not)
[h] - Hitting is Risky

In refrence to the FC, RD, and PP Strings sections:
	The strings labeled '1' are for moves where 
when entering that position, you have little time to 
make your next move.  Those labeled '2' are if you 
have more time to work in those positions.  This is 
subjective, but all moves in '1' sections may be 
used even if section '2' is pointed to.
	Sidestep (SS) does not use this method as if 
you fail to gain the advantage in a sidestep, you are 
still in front position.

Setup for this section is as follows:

?) Link Input [Properties for using this as a Link]
	- Move Input	[Properties] Hit Level (Rating) [Links to ?]

* Ratings for moves are indivdualized for the move they follow.  
  That is, certain moves flow together, the rating reflects that.  
* Certain links have properties that cannot be listed, and as 
  such are not exactly the sum of thier parts.  Try them out to 
  get a feel of what works.
* The move listed is the MOST COMMON used linker, other moves 
  may result in similar setups.
* Keep in mind that these strings are VERY (x3) dependant on whether 
  or not your opponent gets hit, gets hit on counter, or blocks her 
  moves.  In other words, if opponent blocks, they may be pushed 
  back (or the opposite may be true).  You should always be watching 
  EXACTLY what happens when Ling throws her moves.  The difference 
  advantage and spacing means the world.

	Well, if you get anything from any of the above, 
let it be this: LING IS VERSITILE.  She has a ton of moves 
from many different positions, and levels (although she's 
a bit short on the low side) making her an excellent 
stringer.  In the words of Master Wang: "Use the strings, 
Ling!"
	My FAVORITE strings will be listed in the Ling's 
Tricks section.


*************
LING'S TRICKS
*************

BEGIN SELF-GLORIFICATION SEQUENCE...

	Okay, this is the section you've all been waiting 
for: the section where I reveal all of my tricks of the 
trade, and how I use Ling to her fullest advantage and 
beat the crap out of every person I meet.

GLORIFICATION SEQUENCE COMPLETED, FAQ MAY CONTINUE

	Please excuse me there, but I have been doing my 
best to resist the temptation this long, I guess I finally 
had to rant.  
	This is basically all the little things I've found 
over the years I've been playing Ling, and the basic little 
insights into Tekken I've gotten from learning it PRIMARILY 
from the spunky little girl.  (If you didn't know, I tend 
to sidestep a lot, even with other characters).
	So, without further ado...

Strings:

***
Bayonet (1,2), Storming Palm (d/b+1)
	It's simple.  I can hear you asking "What's so 
special about that?"  Well, it's the fact that the Storming 
Palm (d/b+1) connects so often if you use this with other 
strings.  People think Ling is weak after her jabs, in 
fact, the opposite is true: she has a 5/6 frame advantage.  
This being the fact, if anyone starts a move that takes 
longer than 12 frames, they're gonna get busted in the 
teeth.  Use this ONLY if opponent gets hit by both hits of 
the Bayonet, otherwise her advantage is not great enough to 
give you a reasonably safe execution.

***
Bayonet (1,2), Belly Chop (d/f+1{d/f})
	This is Ling's best string starter.  Not do her 
Bayonet (1,2) almost guarantee the Belly Chop (d/f+1{d/f}) 
(actually, if the opponent doesn't block, it *IS* 
guaranteed).  

If you HOLD d/f, from here, you can:
	- Throw
	- d/f+2,1

	Throwing from here is ingenious because of how 
close the belly chop brings you to the opponent, and the 
fact you're still facing forward gives them just enough 
time to duck, which most people will NOT do the first 
couple of times you do this, and will continue to fall 
for it forever after, because any attack they use will 
fall prey to the speed of her throw, and the alternative 
is to duck and take a Sunrise Fan (d/f+2,1) juggle.
	It is HIGHLY reccomended that 75% of the time, 
you HOLD d/f after the Belly Chop (d/f+1{d/f}).  This is 
because if you do not hit the opponent, Ling is at a 
disadvantage when she gets into Rain Dance, and faster 
players will punish her severly.  However, use the 
Rain Dance turn occasionally as a changeup.

***
Stormy (2), Back Circle Breaker (d+3), Sidestep (SS),
Mistrust (4)
	This is an extremely good confusion tactic 
while Ling is turned around.  If you hit them with the
Stormie (2), then you will more than likely hit them 
with the next hit, causing a slight duck animation, 
and allowing the character to do WS moves.  This is 
why you sidestep, because most players will either 
do a WS move, or continue ducking.  
	Immediately after the SS, I check the 
opponent's state:
	1) He did a WS move -> Mistrust
	2) He remained ducking -> Mustrust
	3) He stood up and backed away -> Delay, 
						Mistrust
	A lot of times, Sidestepping with Ling while 
in Rain Dance unnerves people (and with good cause!).  
People will often attack her immediately following a 
sidestep, allowing an easy Mistrust.  

***
Raccon Swing (f,f+3), and setting up.
	The Racoon Swing seems to be the best Okizeme to 
use in a lot of situations.  This is ESPECIALLY true when 
the other person is low on life, because it leaves Ling in 
Rain Dance waiting for the opponent to enter: the optimum 
position.  
	From there, you can Mistrust (4) or Cyclone 
(f,f+3+4,3+4) them into your chosen Juggle, but be SURE to 
buffer a chicken reversal.  
	I tend to get a rhythm going with Ling, mainly 
Juggling them with a Mistrust, and then another, and 
another, until they tag, and do it again.  It's so 
sickeningly effective sometimes you don't need your partner.  

***
Dark and Stormy Mixups (2,1,?)
	Okay, this is commonly known, but if you don't get 
a counterhit on the 2,1 your 4 is gonna miss, because the 
opponent is blocking, right?  Well, there's two ways to 
deal with this:
	- Dealy the 4
	- Throw 
	- Delay even farther, and take a standing 4

	It really depends on how well you can read your 
opponent.  Many people will duck after they see you dealy 
on the 1, hoping to avoid a throw.  This is when you use 
the delayed 4.  
	For people who continue to backup block, the throw 
is in order.  I tend to use this option less in higher level 
play because the throw can whiff give the opponent a juggle 
or worse.  
	The last option is if you didn't feel like throwing 
and the opponent didn't react.  More than likely, they will 
rush in for a move after.  You can usually score a Counter 
with this move, giving you a Storming Palm (d/b+1) off the 
float.  

***
Bayonet (1,2) and Standing Right Kick (4)
	These two moves are staples of my Ling game.  The 
1,2 is the safer of the two, giving you great start and 
recovery (fastest in the game on the former, at WORST a 
few frames if you whiff, which is hard).  It stops strings, 
snuffs reprisals, gives you the advantage, and starts you 
into her custom strings.  Who could ask for more?
	The 4 is better and worse: 
1) The Float on counterhit + Storming Palm (d/b+1) does 
	INCREDIBLE damage for a move this fast.  Not only 
	that but you have a charging came to play 
	afterwards.  
2) It's slower on start and recovery (but not by much)

	All in all, it's one of my favorite moves for 
her, and I have been known to go counterhit hunting with it.  

***
California Roll ((RD) f+3+4)
	This move is an intimidating one, because it puts 
Ling with her back basically touching the enemy's skin.  
It's frightening to opponents, and it plays an INCREDIBLY 
good mixup game between Mistrust (4), Throw, and 
Cyclone (f+3+4,3+4).  Use it whenever you get a chance.  

***
Hop n' Throw ((RD) f,f+(1+3_2+4))
	This move is a great move to throw in 
occasionally.  It's confusing as hell, even to someone 
who's seen it and used it a million times.  The thought 
that goes through thier head is printed on thier faces 
shall be described through Homer Simpson style phrasing:

Normal Person - "Say, she's waving her arms, that must 
		 mean she's... DOH!"
Experienced Person - "Ah!  The hop and throw!  Still some
		      time to get out of the way, now less, 
		      now none!  DOH!"

	I am pleased to admit that my "deer in the 
headlights" reaction to this move is down to around 50%.  

***
Peg Leg ((RD) f,f+3)), Cyclone (f+3+4, 3+4)
	This move is decieving whether you hit the opponent 
with it or not, because people seem to think from the 
animation that she has some kind of recovery time, when in 
fact she has almost none.  
	Even people who play me constantly still fall for 
this 99.95% of the time.  I just don't get it.
	Closely related to this is during Okizeme right after 
a Raccon Swing (f,f+3) that does not knock the opponent away:
	If you follow this up with a Peg Leg ((RD) f,f+3), 
many times the person will roll to the side and get up, almost 
exactly the same time as Ling appears to whiff on her move.  
Here's the trick: these people are slightly off axis, and really 
the only move that they could throw that would injure Ling in 
this tiny period of time is a throw, which is fortunately 
avoided as she launches them with the Cyclone.  This is also
near foolproof.  That is, if they rise as I said, they WILL eat
the Cyclone.

***
Knee Cracker (d/b+3) Okizeme Trick
	There are actually two tricks here.  
The first one is simply, if the opponent is just beginning his 
roll away, you can Knee Cracker (d/b+3) him, and he will end up 
in a more hitable lying position closer to you.  I only use this 
usually on people I expect to rise kick me, as it snuffs it out 
and allows me to continue my Okizeme.

	The second trick is actually a glitch that I used to do 
in my Tekken 3 days, but I do not know the status of in TTT.  
Basically, in certain positions, you could do the Knee 
Cracker (d/b+3) against a sideways-laying opponent, and end up on 
the other side!  What was even better was that the opponent would 
invariable rise kick, to the side Ling just left, thus giving you 
a Mustrust ((RD) 4) to thier back.  Unfortunately, this wouldn't 
work nearly as well in TTT because of how the Mistrust ((RD) 4) 
reacts to back turned opponent.  Perhaps you could try a back 
throw?

***
Left Handful ((PP) 1) to Skyscraper Kick (WS+4)
	This one gets a lot of people, just because of the speed 
that the Skyscraper Kick (WS+4) comes out.  I use it as a 
defensive manuver a lot, as it is pretty safe.

***
Flower Garden ((PP) f+4,4), Skyscraper Kick (WS+4)
	Another trick because of the speed of the Skyscraper 
Kick (WS+4).  

***
Jumping Pirouette ((PP) u,n+3)
	I use this move about once every two games to throw in 
some variety.  It's a non-standard juggle starter if followed 
by a Firecracker (FC+4) into Dark and Stormies (2,1).


***
Side Throw - Arm Flip (Left)

Immediately after Ling's Arm Flip Right throw, begin a dash.  

	If:

1) Opponent rolls away
	Have Ling Slide, she will take the legs out and do 
good damage.  You now have have the opponent in the "slide 
guess" situation, as I call it.  See Ling's Tricks for more 
info.  

2) Opponent does NOT move
	This is troublesome, because Ling does not have enough 
running distance to do a stomp from this throw.  As a result, 
you should run up and immediately pull off the Sunrise Fan 
(d/f+2,1), bringing them into the normal Okizeme sequence.  

3) Opponent flinches even slightly just as Ling arrives
	This is what you're waiting for.  If your timing is 
down, this works 85% of the time, and can do REALLY NICE damage.  
You run up to the opponent, stop just barely short, and do a 
standing 4.  From here, the opponent will either be juggled on 
a counter hit, from where you can Storming Palm (d/f+1), or 
they will be standing with back turned, and you can do an almost 
guaranteed Storming Palm (d/f+1) to thier back, possibly on 
counter.  If you are really gutsy, you can go for a Phoenix 
Wings (f,f+1+2,1+2) after the kick, but it's very uncertain.  
Better than that, if you connect with the Phoenix Wings (f,f+1+2, 
1+2) fast enough, the opponent will still be back turned.  

Remember, Counter + clean hit with the Storming Palm = Devistation
***
Front Throws - Jade (1+3) and Ruby (2+4)

	After either one of Ling's front throws, you can immediately 
followup with a a Sunrise Fan (d/f+2,1). as Okizeme.  However, it is 
possible to rise fast enough to avoid this, blocking it and leaving 
Ling vunerable on the recovery.  This point of my game was weak for 
a while until I discovered a few ways to kill this problem.  Against 
the 5%-10% of people who actually are able to avoid this, you can:

1) Sidestep immediately after the throw using either normal, or 
Rain Dance (b+3+4).  This puts you into attack position immediately, 
with opponent slightly off axis.

2) (prefered method) Fake the Sunrise Fan.  I do this by doing sort 
of a crouch dash (I know, Ling doesn't have one, but it looks 
something like it).  The effect is, you are in front of your 
opponent for an IMMEDIATE throw.  This is really fun because it 
plays an huge mind game for the opponent.  What does he do?  
Usually, they believe you'll go for the Sunrise Fan again, and 
stand, giving you a throw again.  I have done this up to six times 
in a row (against a skilled player, at that, not a scrub).  Finally, 
I went to the last option.

3) After you've conditioned the quick-risers to anticipate the throw, 
and try to duck to catch you on your whiff, you delay the Sunrise Fan.  
	
	This is by far my favorite mind game.  Unfortunately, I am 
unable to do it against most opponents, who just take her Sunrise 
Fan okizeme, which is actually safer, but less damaging, or fun.  

***
Okizeme with Racoon Swing (f,f+3) and Back Circle Breaker ((RD) d+3)
	The trick with this is that you can do a lot of damage with 
this simple combo.  The racoon swing also tends to catch people trying 
to roll out, which can win you a lot of games.  The trick is to have 
it so that Ling either finishes her Racoon Swing chasing the opponent 
on the way out, or a non-turning Back Circle Breaker.  This sets the 
opponent up for a Mistrust or Cyclone as they come in (buffer a 
chicken!).  If you work it right, you can force the opponent out and 
get the partner coming in.  I get this so often it's scary, as the 
entering opponent will take anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 (on Kali or low 
endurance opponent) of thier life.  Even after the Juggle, you still 
get the approach.  

***
{Firedancer ((FC) 3)}, 2,1 Mixups
	This is a good part of Ling's game, but it can be somewhat 
dangerous for her.  The best thing you can do is to catch opponent on 
counter with one of the first two hits.  Afterwards, a Mistrust is 
guaranteed.  
	However, in the case that the opponent blocks it, you can be 
in trouble.  What your success depends on now is how well you read 
your opponent.  

Options:
1) Forget the 4, and go to a throw
	This is EXTREMELY risky against advanced players, as most of 
them will just escape the throw, or even worse, duck under it.  On 
the bright side, you can use (2) to counter people ducking.  

2) Delay 4 - This can be done, often to good effect, and is often 
	forgotten about by even the best of players.  

3) Delay 4, enough for a basic standing 4 to come out.
	This will OFTEN catch opponents on counterhit, giving you a 
float juggle.  Unfortunately, the delay is sometimes too long.  

4) Follow up with a 1,2, (FC) 2
	This will usually catch the opponent on counter, but have a 
much better chance of connecting, and give you the advantage.  No 
real damage like a Mistrust, but lets you keep the initive.  

5) Block
	This is one of the safer, but conceeds the advantage, which 
is not optimal.

6) Duck
	Make opponent whiff a high, quick reprisal.  Somewhat risky, 
but effective sometimes.  


***
Flower Power ((PP) u+4, {4})
	
	Okay, everyone expects the second hit.  There are really 
some good followups if you do NOT do it, though.  

1) ~u, Rain Dance
	You have time by virtue of unexpectedness.  Reccomend 
immediate action after this.  An instantaneous Mistrust often 
connects for some reason.

2) WS+4, WS+2
	Ling counts as standing up immediately following the move, 
so you can execute these.

3) Throw
	If the move hits, the opponents will often be close enough 
for an immediate throw

4) Phoenix Position (d+1+2), SS, Rain Dance (b+3+4)
	People seem inclined to immediately reprise this move, so 
these moves are great for a juggle or other damaging action.  

5) Quick Poke (1,2; 4; (FC) 1; etc.)
	This will maintain the initiative, possibly counterhit.  	

***
A word on Ling's Low 1
	I tend to not use Ling's d+1 while standing forward, as it 
is OFTEN taken as D+1, her Sunset Fan, which is a much slower move, 
and often gets me hurt.  I use her d+2 in this case.  It's 2 frames 
slower than the d+1, but is safer.  This does not mean I do not use 
her d+1, I do, but only from Rain Dance, full crouch, or Phoenix 
Position, as these all have excellent followups.

- Reccomended: WS+4, WS+2, (FC) 3,2


***
A word on back kick opponents (On the ground, b,b+3+4)
	Ling has excellent Okizeme, and this is one of the banes 
of it, as she often has to come in from long range to do it.  Many 
players learn that the b,b+3+4 while grounded is a great way to 
stop Ling from her followups.  Well, they're partially right.
	The thing about this trick is that you have to be watching 
for it, and anticipate it, otherwise you won't get it.  AS SOON 
as you see them flinch in thier b,b motion, do a d/f+1.  Don't worry 
about a back roll or tag out attempt, because at worst they'll be 
away from you with back turned, which isn't neccicarily a bad thing, 
and if they tag out, you're in Rain Dance position when the partner 
enters, not too shabby.  The thing is, though, is that the d/f+1 will 
float the opponent perfectly, setting the opponent up for a (RD) 2, 
(RD) 2~1, f,f+1+2,1+2 (or any other small combo you want).
	One thing to watch for is if they actually did b,f+1+2, which 
this move will NOT catch.  Bascically, if you do the d/f+1 and do NOT 
catch the opponent, immediately sidestep.  This will avoid the head 
dive, and give you an opportunity to chase the opponent's back, which 
I've always enjoyed.
	Use this trick if you can, it's a real crowd pleaser.  It 
also adds more fear to the opponent in thier getup game, which is 
always a good thing to introduce.  
***
Ling's Phoenix Position - Firecracker and Wave Crest - Quick.
	Use this often, especially during poking games, as you can 
catch the opponent for an easy juggle, or just use her Firecracker (4~3).
The firecracker is an excellent move.  It's low, quick, it's one of the 
safest moves in the game, and people almost never block it, even at a 
high level of play - it's just too dangerous for people to duck against 
her in that position.  
	There is also one special property to the Phoenix position not 
found in Tekken 3 - that, when back turned, in the Phoenix Position, 
she is able to do the Mistrust without standing up.  This is very 
useful when people are doing a head dive against her, as the position 
avoids this and lets you hit them as they're flying past.  While this 
won't juggle, it does set you up for Okizeme.  

More to come!

VS. Opponents

Alex - Alex is not too much of a problem, just watch out for the SS+4 low sweep thing, and 
	you should be alright for the most part.  Also, his Animal Uppercut move can REALLY, 
	REALLY, REALLY hurt Ling, especially with her low stamina.

Do:	- Block the SS+4.
	- Use her Sunrise Fan against frontal attacks.
	- Poke him off balance,

Do Not:	- Sidestep his crouch dash or sidestep moves,


====
Anna - Anna can be a pain in the ass (no refrence to any move intended, really!).  Her elbow 
	launcher can catch you often, and if her quick pokes can connect

Strategy: Schoolgirl's Temprament, Maiden's Perogative

Do:	- Launch Anna whenever possible, keep her on the ground
	- Sidestep
	- Parry her strings.
	- Low parry after a blocked counterhit-elbow

Do Not: - Poke her to death
	- Let her run poking strings on you.  Interupt her any way you can.

=======
A. King - I've never had that much difficulty with A. King with Ling.  His moves are mostly 
		too slow I think, and easily sidestepped.  There is a problem if he gets 
		you on the defense, as he does have an annoying high-low mix-up game.

Strategy: Schoolgirl's Temprament, Maiden's Perogative, Teasing the Teacher, 
	  Wrath of the Schoolgirl

Do:	- Use any tactics you like against him.
	- Learn his high-low mix-ups

Do Not: - Let him throw you
	- Go into the Phoenix Position obviously
	- Fall repeatedly for that double-footed, low lunge of death

====
Baek - Baek can be a problem, honestly.  His strings are confusing, he gets all sorts of 
	little cheap shots, and very little recovery time on a lot of his strings.

Strategy: Maiden's Perogative, Teasing the Teacher

Do:	- Throw him
	- Learn his strings, and how to avoid/block/parry them
	- Use the Phoenix Position to your advantage during his strings
	- Sidestep opposite him

Do Not: - Use too frontal attack methods on him.  
	- Get counterhit by his strings


=====
Bruce - Bruce is just a power house.  Combined with Ling's low stamina, it takes you from 
	140 to nill in 6 seconds.  This in mind, be careful!

Strategy: Schoolgirl's Temprament, Maiden's Perogative

Do:	- Use the Phoenix Position, his low attcks are slow
	- Throw him
	- Sidestep
	- Be careful

Do Not:	- Poke him to death, his d/f+2 elbow launcher will get you (however, if he doesn't 
	  use this move, feel free!)
	- Reprise too quickly after a sidestep if he's in a string, as it WILL track.

=====
Bryan - Although Similar, Bryan is much more dangerous to an unaware Ling than Bruce.  He 
	does nasty damage, and is quick.

Strategy: Maiden's Perogative, Wrath of the Schoolgirl

Do:	- Use her Sunrise Fan as a shield
	- Use the Phoenix Position

Do Not: - Let him keep the initive for any length of time
	- Fall for his low d/b+3 / u+4 changeups
	- Let him catch you rising of the ground
	- Be to obvious with punch strings, his parry is nasty.

=====
Devil - Devil is probably your least dangerous Mishima.  Watch for the twin pistons.
	Do a Phoenix Position or Belly Chop to avoid the Laser.

Strategy: Schoolgirl's Temprament, Maiden's Perogative, Teasing the Teacher, 
	  Wrath of the Schoolgirl

Do:	- Use the Phoenix Position

Do Not: - Fall for the laser
	- Get hit by the twin pistons
	- Get hit by his SS launcher, you'll probably lose 1/2 your life

====
Eddy - Eddy is very rarely a problem for me anymore.  Best thing to do is to pitbull him or 
	interupt his strings.  But beware the Eddy master!

Strategy: Teasing the Teacher, Wrath of the Schoolgirl

Do:	- Interupt his strings early.  Sunrise/Sunset fan, Phoenix Wings, Front/Back Layout, 
		Cyclone, Racoon Swing are good for this purpose.
	- Keep him on the defensive

Do Not: - Let him use his strings

======
Ganryu - Ganryu is a pain to Ling.  Because of his large size, he is very difficult to 
	 get around sidestepping unless he does a forward momentum move.  He also has great 
	 frame advantage on many of his moves.

Strategy: Teasing the Teacher

Do:	- Use pokes to keep him back
	- Use defensive gameplay
	- Use the Storming Palm

Do Not:	- Let him get the offensive
	- Sidestep carelessly

=======
G. Jack - G. Jack is a ball to play with Ling.  Very rarely is there any problem at all.  He's 
	  just too slow to touch her if you keep moving correctly.

Strategy: Schoolgirl's Temprament, Maiden's Perogative, Wrath of the Schoolgirl

Do:	- Sidestep a lot
	- Use Phoenix Wings

Heihachi - "Heihachi kills, rapes and pillages poor little Ling, and it's not even fair.", as 
	   someone on Tekken.net's message board put it, and frankly, it's true.  Heihachi 
	   has everything he needs to dominate the little girl.  He could be one of the most 
	   difficult opponents.
		Heihachi opponents tend to really like ducking, and then coming up with his 
	   big fist in the face.  Anticipate this.

Hworang - 
	Lotsa' damage, nasty strings, not really a problem.  I really enjoy playing 
	against Hworang now, as his methods are easily countered by Ling on most days.

Strategy: Maiden's Perogative, Teasing the Teacher, Wrath of the Schoolgirl

Do:	- Keep him on the defensive
	- Use the Sunrise Fan (d/f+2,1) to stop slower strings

Julia - Kill her, a lot.  Julia tends to run people to the ends of the earth with 
        her pokes, and things a lot stronger.  The important thing is to not let her 
	run you to death.  

Strategy: Schoolgirl's Temprament, Maiden's Perogative, Teasing the Teacher

Jun - A good Jun can be a pain for Ling.  She has moves that have very high priority, 
      like the cartwheel kick and palm thrust, and other quick moves such as her standing 
      uppercut that can launch you easily.  She does good damage, and should not be taken 
      lightly.

======
Kazuya - Ow! Ow! OOOOWWW!  Is about what you'll say if you give him a chance.  He's fast, 
	 does nasty damage, and generally murders a careless opponent.  He also tends to 
	 turtle, which is probably the hardest thing against Ling.

Strategy: Teasing the Teacher (with caution!)

Do:	- Use the Phoenix Wings whenever possible on a guarding Kazuya, it gives you the 
	  appearance of attacking later than you do, often getting a counter.
	- Use the Phoenix Position
	- Throw

Do Not: - Get hit by counter on anything
	- Let him hit you

====
King - 	King does nasty damage, really nasty.  On the bright side, though, he is pretty 
	slow.  Usually if you can keep him on the defensive, he's not a problem.  Be sure 
	to regain the offensive as quickly as possible.

Strategy: Teasing the Teacher

Do:	- Use the Storming Palm
	- Use the Sunrise Fan

Do Not:	- Let him run you with Okizeme
	- Let him throw you

=========
Kunimitsu - I have seen the pain that Kunimitsu can dish out, and it ain't pretty.  Her 
	    style is actually very, very similar to Ling (so you'd think I'd be able to 
	    play her better).  The best thing you have to do is play a good back and 
	    forth game, and watch for her certain key moves.  Be VERY careful about 
	    being overly offensive.

Strategy: Schoolgirl's Temprament, Maiden's Perogative, Teasing the Teacher

Do:	- Watch for the d+3+4 overhead flip kick
	- Watch for the FC d,df+4 sweep kick

	- Watch for the b+2 unblockable
	- Watch for the Back Turned flip

Do Not: - Get hit by the above mentioned moves

===
Law - Law can be really, really annoying sometimes.  His combos are long and damaging, 
      and he has the annoying d+2,4 starter.

Strategy: Maiden's Perogative, Teasing the Teacher

Do:	- Watch the d+2,4 starter
	- Use the Sunrise Fan after a missed flipkick

Do Not:	- Get juggled by successive flipkicks

Lee - I watch Lee players VERY carefully.  It seems like his arsenal is made 
      specifically to thwart Ling.  

Strategy: Maiden's Perogative, Teasing the Teacher

Do:	- Parry, and low parry everything you can in a string.
	- Block when you should

Do Not: - Get hit by the first hit of his Infitity Kicks (Low Parry the 3rd kick!)

===
Lei - Annoying!  Not fun to play against.  Annoying ground stuff.  Low move that 
     is WAY too strong.  Good Okizeme.

Strategy: Maiden's Perogative, Teasing the Teacher

Do:	- Use caution in Okizeme against him
	- Learn to predict his ground changeups (especially the two-footed kick)

Do Not: - Eat the back turned sweep-o-cheeze

====
Ling - Ling vs. Ling fights are always fun, and I personally have a lot of fun with 
       them (feels like I'm protecting her honor).  The best way to beat Ling is to 
       KNOW Ling.  You will often get into back-turned fights, and these are the 
       key to winning against her.

Strategy: Schoolgirl's Temprament, Maiden's Perogative, Teasing the Teacher

Do:	- Be confusing as hell
	- Sidestep (this is a MUST)

Mokujin - Duh!  Figure out who he's mimicing, and go from there.

====
Nina - Nina is just as much of a pain as Anna, in my opinion, but not quite as dangerous 
       anymore.  

Strategy: Schoolgirl's Temprament, Maiden's Perogative

P. Jack - Different, but uses a strategy similar enough to the other Jacks not to matter.

=======
T. Ogre - OWWWWwwwwwwww...!  Talk about major damage.  I'd rather be hit by the Phoenix 
	  Smasher than take one of T. Ogre's combos (and subsequent 50-80 damage Okizeme).
	  He is quite possibly the most under-rated character in the game, and one of the 
	  most dangerous by far.

Do Not: - Duck, most of Wang's nasty moves are Mid
	- Attack when you both have large attack time (Wang's moves can hurt a LOT)

==========
Yoshimitsu - Yoshi is the master of the 'what move is he gonna do next?' style of 
	     gameplay.  He has nasty combinations resulting from odd minor stuns, 
	     floats, and unblockables.  He is agile and has a large repitoire of 
	     moves.

Strategy: Maiden's Perogative

Do:	- Anticipate; there are combinations that Yoshi does a lot, see if you can 
	              guess them.
	- Watch the quick low sweep
	- Use the Bayonette and throws as a reprisal

Do Not: - Fall into timing traps.  Often you'll see an opportunity to attack that's 
	  	really a trick.
	- Fall repeatedly for low moves
	- Be overly offensive

God, so many people here.

Ling's Practice Dummies:

Lin -  Who taught me rudimentary Ling style, and allowed me to get out of 
	my scrub phase.  (Yes, I was a Ling scrub!)

Alan Larson - Friend, Compatriot, Tekken Freak the same as I.  
		Thanks for taking all the beatings you did over the years
		from my annoying little schoolgirl.

Jake Raines - Also Friend, chum, Tekken Freak as well.

Takuma - Sorry I can't remember your last name, dude, but you've never told 
	 me!  Ah, wasting our time away daily at Playland Go! in Akita against 
	 your True Ogre/Kuma team that made my Ling advance to the final level.
	 It took me nearly 2 weeks to be able to play against you and win at all!
	 Second Note: Since you've changed to Mishima ultra-offense style, I've 
	 learned a bunch about why people use them, and why I should be using 
	 Julia instead of Jun as Ling's partner.

Enoki - Your Mokujin/Lei team taught me more about tag sliding, head diving 
	than anything.  May we continue playing at Taito until I leave for home.  

Eiko - You are a turtle, and you have the hardest style to play against that I've 
       ever seen.  Your style forced me to use different moves, and discover 
       strengths and weaknesses in Ling's.  Thanks for keeping my ego in check.

Everyone at Say Taito, Akita; Playland Do!, Akita; and Pop's Arcade, Minneapols - 
	Who provided the the rounding for my style, and improving my Tekken 
	abilities in general.  While I spent my year in Japan and everything else 
	in my life turned upside-down, Tekken remained constant, because I always 
	had good friends to play with.  I'll remember our friendship and miss you 
	all.

People on the Web:

(jkkim@nwu.edu) - Creater of the original FAQ from which I formulated this one.  
		  Although the move list is completely rewritten, some of the 
		  original wording remains here and there.  
	
Tekken Zaibatsu (http://www.tekken.net) - 
	Without who's help, I would have been lost for knowlage about Tekken's 
	intricate system.  Thanks to them, I finally understand why little Ling 
	can do so much damage with her little hand on clean hit/counter.  


***
For people who want to know why I think Ling is Left Handed, and why it's an 
advantage:
	- Her Storming Palm, 'nuff said.
		It's done with d/b+1, which is her left hand.  NO ONE would do 
	a move that strong with thier off hand, and if they could, I'd be a 
	little bit worried about Ling's right.  

	As far as being an advnatage goes, I honestly don't know.  I'm sure it 
plays a role somewhere.  Perhaps she gets strength during the fight from the 
anger caused by lack of a pair of workable scisors when she last trimmed Panda 
(or perhaps from the sparing practice that occured afterwards, when Panda didn't 
like her new 'do.).
	Other Evidance:
		Wang's left hand reversal cannot be chickened.  Perhaps he got 
sick of being beaten by a little girl with such a strong left hand and then 
became proficient at countering it?


Note: in Tekken Bowl on the PS2 version of Tekken Tag, Ling bowls RIGHT-handed...
	this may debunk my theory, but I'm not sure.  If she really is right-
	handed, she's awful ambidextrious for my tastes.
