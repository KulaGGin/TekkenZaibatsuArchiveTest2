Writing a FAQ is very hard and I do appreciate that no tekken
nuts like you try to earn money off of my hard work. This means
if you try to sell this FAQ to anyone and that I finds out(and
do believe me.... I will) I will have no choice but to take
200% from what you earn to my own bank acount. Furthermore, don't
just throw this FAQ into your webpage without a permission. If I
didn't agree... than ASK me and I probably will agree with in
twenty-four hour period. But... ASK me first! AND DON'T JUST
SKIP THIS PART OF THE FAQ LIKE I ALWAYS DO, READ EVERYTHING! lol j/k


--------------
-  About Me  -
--------------

I have some "good" experience with tekken and is honestly by god a
tekken nut. I played tekken I through tag and virtual fighter before
that. If you find this FAQ a little hard to read like the spelling
and grammer.... well I'm sorry, just try to live with it as I
humor you with foriegn jokes that you can't understand for
the next hour or so. My grammer and spelling is good but they are
horrible on the internet so don't bother to tell me to correct it.
Furthermore, yes I really do have white hair -_-; ... use to... and
now I only have a long black hair left.. sigh... Oh yeah, just want
to mention this to some people who know me. I use to live in Austin
and played a lot of Tekken 3 at the arcade in North Cross Mall... If
you remember me, I was the tall chinese dude ^_^; I was third
place in one of Austin's Tekken 3 tournment. I had a master who
I think is the manager of a domino pizza shop who I believe wrote
a tekken 3 FAQ about king. If you are ready the master, look how
your grasshopper has grown?! .... And do contact me! btw I moved
to lubbock and is still here....


--------------------
-  About this FAQ  -
--------------------

Let's get a few things right here... This is not a FAQ for newbie
button smasher who thinks that if they can make Eddy or Howarang
move, they can master tekken -_-. This FAQ needs a little bit
of advance knowledge and will help you to gain ten folds of power
as I share my wisdom to you(call me master from now on if you are
reading this FAQ). Now my little grasshopper, I will not enclude
a standard move list in this FAQ because there are just too many
of them and basicly you can find them everywhere. Furthermore, this
FAQ is create only for ARCADE not for Playstation 2. Also, is not
made so that you can have a basic idea of how to beat the computer.
This FAQ is in depth which will teach you how to kick someone's arse
while laughing in their face.... not to mention earning some extra
money for your local arcade! YES SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL ARCADE!

-  Why Kuni? --
---------------

Okay grasshopper, here is the big question.... Why do I want to
use Kunimitsu? Why shouldn't I use someone powerful like dumb nut
Lei or gay ass Paul? Why should I use someone like Kunimitsu? Will
there is a lot of reason why you should choose her.... let us
first look at her strength and weakness.

------------------------------------------- Strength -----------

1)  Super Manji Teenage Mutan... Ninja Power!
2)  Its a she(don't mock me)
3)  Cutest Outfits
4)  Wonderful Juggler
5)  Blocking means nothing to her
6)  Simple, every move has a use
7)  Very agile and fast!
8)  Great throw!
9)  Out standing poker!
10)  The so called "Death Combo" that I will share....
11) Not many people use her! Hurrai! Be special and wow the crowd!

------------------------------------------- Weakness -----------

1)  -_- ugly start button outfit (look like a cheap whore)
2)  Not partner beginning graphic or end graphic... sigh...

As you can see... there are more strength than weaknessess. One of
her best feature is her unblockable which most people don't consider.
The reason why they are important is that they acts as power moves
that take people down when they hit... unlike most unblockable
that Yoshimistu has. Furthermore, she is great poker and her
speed is as fast as Ling Xiaoyu... seriously! Beside, if you saw
crouching tigger, hidden dragon..... you will notice a witch called
the "Jade Fox" which is pretty much Kunimitsu!!!!! (and yes.. I am
aware that she is japanese -_-)


------------------------------
- Complete Movelist Analysis -
------------------------------

In this section, I will tell you the amount each move take and
how to excute them. Furthermore, I will tell you how to use them
and when to use them. Also, I will judge each move's usage by
star which one star(*) is the lowest and five star(*****) is
the highest. The legends that I use in this FAQ is pretty much
universal Tekken FAQ legends which every tekken FAQ reader
should know by now.

------------------------------------------- Throw ------------

Flying Press (1+3)
usage(***)
escape(1)
damage(30)

  This is your basic throw where Kunimitsu pickup your
enemy and slam them to the group 69 style! please, no jokes...
seriously!I have seen other say that they perfer the other
basic throw over this one because of follow up capabilities...
and I just like to say how wrong they are. First of all, both
throw give the other player about the same time to get up and
this one do have a follow up to it that no one uses.
  Try using f,f+3+4 after this throw... which shouldn't
wait and should be done every time you execute this throw. If
the other player roll back... it will hit them... if they side
roll please use 3+4 follow up so Kuni can fly across giving
her room to either run in for slide or do some cloth up hits
if the other player rolls back after side roll. Either way, you
gain and keep control of the board!

--------------------------------------------------------------

Jawcrusher (2+4)
usage(***)
escape(2)
damage(30)

  This is your second basic throw and it is somewhat
useful. There is many followup possible after this throw. However
I wouldn't suggest the poison wind(u/f+3+4) because sometime it
will miss(like when the other player get up really quick) and leave
you helpless. Try some of the other follow up like fairy wax(d+3+4)
or Spinning Trip Sweep(FC,d/f+3). But my favorite is still the
Spinning Leg Sweep(FC,D/B+3...) which is guarantee juggle if they
try to move.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Psuedo Throw (d/b+1+3)
usage(***)
escape(1+2)
damage(35)

  In another FAQ, this throw is called the "Judo Throw"
lol which I like the name. However, I didn't want to steal the
name so I shall call it Psuedo Throw!!! Hey, it rhymes! Any who
this is a great throw which gives you a lot of followups. However
the time to do those follow up is still a little too slow which
really is kindda of a down side....

--------------------------------------------------------------

Your head, the floor, oh no! throw (f+1+4)
usage(*****)
escape(d/f)
damage(35)

  Fancy name, no kidding! What kunimitsu does is jump
on your opponent's head and slam them to the ground! The reason
I gave the throw a five star is that it is a wonderful throw, duh!
First of all, the animation for executing this throw is a little
different which can knock off some people. Furthermore, the
escape is very strange and since the throw is really quick, I'm
sure not even the BEST tekken player can escape from it everytime.
If it is escaped, Kuni will land behind your opponent, back facing
back. The strange part of this is that your opponent will have
a little lag time from crouching down foward which give you just
a few frame advantages! What I suggest is a u/f+4 which is a
standard back jump kick which also juggle, yummie!
  So if the throw connects... than what should I do? Will
grasshopper, what you should do is f,f+3+4 just like the flying
press which you should have read earlier above.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Side Arm Bar Throw (side 1+3)
usage(**)
escape(1)
damage(40)

  A side throw.. pretty nifty which leaves a few follow
ups. I actually never excute a side throw with the 1+3 or 2+4
because I have the option of f+1+4 which somehow I think
the opponent can't escape out of it... but I could be wrong?

--------------------------------------------------------------

Swirllie Throw (side 1+3)
usage(***)
escape(2)
damage(40)

  What this does is Kuni grab your opponent's arm and
spends in crazy speed until they are all dizzy. Weird throw
which you can tag out which I wouldn't suggest unless you
are low on heath because your partner sometimes come in too
far and followups are hard to connect. What I do suggest
is a run in slide which 90% will hit your opponent.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Neck Flip (back 1+3)
usage(**)
escape(n/a)
damage(50)

	Nothing special... standard Tekken back throw.. however
lands your opponent head afront of you for some great followups!


------------------------------------------- Moves ------------

Punch & Low Puch (1 & d+1)
usage(*****)
damage(8?)

  Very fast poker! Especially the d+1 which is great setup
for some custom combo. This is also pretty common in juggle too.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Backfist (f+2 or BK 2)
usage(*****)
damage(12?)

  Who ever said this move sucks should just go to hell!
Personally, I love this backfist! First of all, sure it is a little
slow to execute but when ever a opponent whiffs... use this! Using
it after a whiffs should be what come on to your head first!
Also, you can use this when a partner just come in which will
definely turn them around. These is however has a little recovery
lag after this but it is just too small that won't get you
into "too" much trouble.
  So why is it such a good move? The reason it is is because
of the wonderful damaging followups. Most good player would
go for the shark dive (f,f+3+4 than 1+2) which I would recommand
too. It does killer damage and is almost guaranteed after the
opponents turn their back. But if your opponent knows how to
get out by crouching... here is what you do... (get ready, this
is my death combo!) Try the Reverse Solar Kick (f,f+1+2) and
the backward jump juggle kick (u/f+4) afterward... this two move
both does insane damage and it juggles for some more damage
which is more than the shark dive do. Furthermore, don't worry
about the opponent crouching after the reverse solar kick.. the
juggle back jump hits mid! lol :p

--------------------------------------------------------------

Jab, Kick_Low Kick (2,3_d+3)
usage(**)
damage(12, 21_8)

  I use the 2,d+3 for poking sometimes and the other one
for juggleing to replace the single zigzag kick(3) because
it cause 1 more damage lol But other than that? I really can't
think of much of a use for this.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Fist Stab (1+2)
usage(****)
damage(22)

  How useful is this? Very! Kuni leans back dodging high
and some mid move while come back to stab your opponent. This
is her power punch and it has wonder range. Furthermore, it is
very fast and should be used often to keep someone off of you.
But what is really amazing is killing poker freaks as they
try to poke you with 1 or 2 and you can just dodge it with this
move and counter them back. One of my favorite against Ling Xiaoyu
as she try to poke me with BK 2 all the time.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Windtry Wind (SS+1+2)
usage(****)
damage(21)

  This move hits high which is kindda sad... however it
is a great side step move. This is pretty safe after your opponent
blocks it. However, if it hits, I would suggest you continue this
move even if your opponent is on the ground. Why? Will, grasshopper,
if the other player rolls foward or backward... it will hit
them again. If they try to get up and kick you, they will miss!
That's right! They will miss you completely! Either with your back
to theirs or their side to your face... so what do we do after that?
Heheheheh.... need I say more? THROW!!!
  Oh yeah, and don't worry about side roll because this move
tracks pretty will that the opponent won't get anywhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Smoke Dodge (d+1+2)
usage(***)
damage(None)

  What every ninja should know how to do... smoke, than the
disappearing trick! This move goes under high and mid moves and
sometimes low moves.. if the timing is right... I like to do
this move when I see some one is charging toward me from far
far away which their... slide... shoulder... kick... or anything
else would just miss. Also, this move gives you some great style
points and can follow up with a throw like (f+1+4)

--------------------------------------------------------------

Spinning Fist (B+1,1,1,1,1,1)
usage(***)
damage(10,10,10,10,10,10)

  Use mostly in juggle... however, you can try it while
not juggling to get close to the opponent. I use this so I can
get close to buffer in a throw which is pretty useful.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Quick Leg (D/B+3,3,3,3_f+4)
usage(***)
damage(12,7,7,5_12)

  This move is executed before the fourth spinning fist
whic Kuni will quickly change into spinning low sweeps. Pretty
useful, especially when trying to confuse your opponents.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Spinning Leg (FC,D/B+3,3,3,3,3)
usage(****)
damage(12,7,7,5,5)

  What a neat low move. If all the sweep hit, you can get
36 damage off of your opponent's life bar! Don't try to use
this from far away because your opponent will either block or
make you use some power move. If you use in close range, the
start isn't too slow and it will definitly get you a few
damage... oh yeah, I think if you counter, it turns the
opponent to the side.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Back Jump Kick (BK u/f+4)
usage(****)
damage(20?)

  This isn't really a special move, but I just want to include
it because it is so useful. It does pretty good damage for
Kuni and it juggles the opponent! I love doing this with
Reverse Solar Kick(f,f+1+2) for some big damage.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Trip Sweep (FC,df+3)
usage(****)
damage(12)

  A decent low knock down move which should be used often. Many
followups are possible but I wouldn't suggest the poison wind
(u/f+3+4) because if your opponent get up really fast or does
a really fast getup kick, you will miss them which will leave
you in a backturn position ready to get some real "ouch". I do
suggest a (ws+4) combo which is much safer.
  For more info, look in the follow up or combo section.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Dashing Uppercut (f,f+2)
usage(****)
damage(24)

  This move does very good damage for Kuni and it juggle your
opponent very high. The best part is that it ducks high and
some mid moves *cough*deathfist*cough* and it recovers pretty
well which some people have disagreed with me. I always point
out that if your opponent blocks this move, it seems that
they are being pushed back a little which gives you enough
room to recover. Nevertheless, very good juggler starter which
should be used often.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Rush in Uppercut (d/f+2)
usage(****)
damage(13)

  What can I say? This is Kuni's basic uppercut move. One hit
from this and your opponent is sky bond(other than fat characters
like the Jacks). This is also a good poker that you and end
after a few spinning backfist (B+1,1,1...) which usually
will trick your opponent into a crouch.
  See the Juggle section for more information about followups.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Manji Knee (f,f+4)
usage(***)
damage(10)

  Kuni jumps really fast and bash her opponent with a knee.
However, I wouldn't suggest this knee in a juggle because it
does so little damage to your foe, there are just better
options. What this should be used for is to interupt moves
since it comes out so fast and pretty much stops anything
that comes towards it.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Stepping Stone Kick (u+4_u/b+4_u/f+4)
usage(****)
damage(25?)

  Alright, why so many stars for this move? Others have said
that this move isn't worth it but I totally disagree. And as a
pupil of mine, you should always listen to your master!
  Okay, here is the usefulness of this little move. One thing
it is a "knock down" move which will guarantee knock your
opponent down when its hit. Second, it hits special mid which
basicly means that it will hit crouching freaks. Third, it has
a good recovery time which leaves you in a safe position for
some poking. Fourth, it is very fast to execute and can
interupt many incoming moves.
  The most important of this move is to interupt incoming moves
because it will basicly stop EVERYTHING. I especially suggest
when you see someone do unblockable moves and you don't have
the time to get near them to stop them. This is where the
(u/b+4) come a long. I have stopped so many unblockables with
this moves such as Ganyu's Sumo Charge(b+1+2), Paul's Super
Death Fist(b+1+2), Law's Dragon Fist(d/b+1+2), and Lei's
Super Flip Kick (Hawk b+4) just to name a few. So when
ever you see someone about to come charging towards you like
after they blocked all your custom combo or pokes; use this
move! It is pretty much a guarantee counter damage for them.
  I have read another Kuni FAQ by Han and thought his Judo
Throw thingie is pretty funny. At first I'm pretty shy
and didn't yell out JUDO THROW! every time I use it. But now
it is a bad habit of mine and I use it to trick people. Sometimes
in a important or tough match... I would yell out JUDE THROW! to
trick my opponent to crouch... and BOOM! I hit them with this
move instead lol hmmm... The fox... tricking your opponent
is the key! Even if it means that you have to take action yourself.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Poison Wind (u/f+3+4)
usage(*****)
damage(21)

  You don't know how useful this move is. This is not a stand
a long move and to be just used openly. However, this is
move of a connector move and should be used often. It is
very hard to explain it here, please go to the followups section
to understand more. This is very important! Be sure you read
the followup section.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Fairy Wax (FC_d+3+4)
usage(****)
damage(5,23)

  This is another power move for Kunimistu and should be used
often as a poker since it has incredible recovery time. There
is many followups after this little move and I would suggest
a poison wind since it is 100% guaranteed and gives you
around 49 damage like a Death Fist. WOW!
  However, I have notice many people said to use this when
your opponent is down on the ground. I personally wouldn't
suggest this because it is not guaranteed and it gives
you around 40% of hitting that opponent with both kicks.
  Don't forget to read the followup section to get more
indepth with this move.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Spin-of-m'jeg (u,d+3)
usage(***)
damage(25)

  Kunimitsu jumps into the air and comes down only tricking
her opponent with a low hit. I use this move to trick people
and hitting them on the ground sometimes. It is pretty useful
and I find that not many people can block it.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Growling Jewel (f+3+4)
usage(****)
damage(30)

  Another Kuni's power move. This move is both good when block
and hit. (I'll try to explain this later in the followup section)
If this move connects, it waste 30 damage off of your opponent's
life bar. However, if it is blocked, your opponent will
expereince a block stun. However, do remember that when blocked
Kuni is a little side stepped which any poking will miss.
  Go to the followups section to get some more info on
this move.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Body Sweep (SS+3+4)
usage(*****)
damage(15)

  The best low move Kuni has! Its fast and it knock your opponent
down with no tech roll. Though Kuni do stagger if this move
is blocked. But I wouldn't worry too much since that stagger
dodges all high and most mid moves.
  Go to the followups section to get some more info on
this move.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Fox Kick (U/F,3_N+3_N,3)
usage(***)
damage(depends)

  So this isn't really a move but I wanted to include this. Sure
you might argue that all character has this move. However, no
many people can see its usefulness and never bother to
use it. This move can hit really high or mid or low.
  On a high hit.... I don't see much use in this, though
I only linked it in a juggle just a few times.
  On a low hit.... A differen't mix up which does some
amount of damage without knock down. I use this to
mix up with the mid hit kick.
  On mid hit.... Okay, this is where this move shines! If
it counter or clean hit(maybe both), it actually stun
the enemy enough for a big juggle! or a unblockable.. or
a growling jewel! Neat, huh?

--------------------------------------------------------------

Reverse Flipkick (BK 3)
usage(***)
damage(22)

  Nothing too special since it is pretty rare for you to be
facing behind your opponent. Most useful thing about this move
is for poking since when blocked your opponent staggers. Try
a d+1 after this move. If this move is hit a regular 4 is
100% guaranteed which is about a Death Fist damage.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Reverse Solar Kick (f,f+1+2)
usage(***)
damage(22)

  Also another poking move with great executing and finish
time. I mix up with a d+1 to poke or a u/f+4 for some juggle.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Solar Kick (f,f+3+4)
usage(***)
damage(30)
  - Shark Dive (1+2)
    usage(**)
    damage(40)
  - Reverse Flip Kick (3)
    usage(***)
    damage(25)
  - Manji Leap (3+4)
    usage(***)
    damage(n/a)

  The first move is a regular solar kick that leaves Kuni in
the back position. It does 30 damage and I use this so that
when it counters it the shark dive should be guaranteed. After
the solar kick, you get three option.
  The shark dive is hard to land off. However, if it ever do
lands off... it cause MAJOR DAMAGE! especially if your opponent's
in a back turn position.. *cough*LEILING*cough* Furthermore, if
this move is blocked, it is pretty safe too since it will avoid
all high and some mid move. It will also avoid your opponent's
d+1 poke! Oh yeah, this move leaves you in crouch for some
custom mix up!
  Just like the above Reverse Flip Kick that does a little more
damage. However, what's sad is that it dosn't hit people when
they are crouching.... Well, at least it dosn't in the arcade
version.
  Manji Leap! Kuni jumps up over her opponent confusing them
and making them nervous. I use to tag out because it confuse
your opponent a bit and they would do any sudden reaction.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Flip Kick (f,f+3, 4)
usage(**)
damage(30)

  This is most for style points. Other than that... I see
no points in using this move. Won't it be great if this
move can be don't in a juggle? WHY NOT NAMCO! DAMMIT! However,
I did like to name out that the first flip kick a lone can
confuse your character into a throw.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Zig-Zag (3,4)
usage(**)
damage(30,30)

  A classic move, the first kick is great and it is one of
Kuni's power move. After the first, everyone knows that a second
mid kick follows. This is where a trick comes out.... If your
opponent stays back and blocks.. try a b+2 after this move
for an unblockable. But if they come after you... just do the
last kick with a chicken of course.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Tri-Kick (4,4,4)
usage(**)
damage(20,20,21)

  Try not to do all try kicks unless you know you have a scrub
or dumb nut playing you. However, you can try using the first
kick just for poking. It comes out fast and has good range. Also,
I some time do two kick and an unblockable to confuse my
opponent.

------------------------------------- Unblockable ------------

This is where Kuni is all about. THE UNBLOCKABLES! You must
use her unblockable more than five times a round or you are
not a Kuni player! Grrrr... just imagine... what would all
those Ogre player be if there isn't Kuni's unblockable to
support them with.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Kunai Stab (d/b+2)
usage(**)
damage(15)

  WHY NAMCO?! WHY WON'T THIS MOVE HIT GROUND OPPONENT? I mean
if you look at it... it looks like it really hits them. DAMMIT!
However, it is pretty fast and used for poking and knock
off some last damages.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Kunai Dive (u+1+2)
usage(****)
damage(25)

  Very fast unblockable with only the range problem. However, I
always catch my opponent with this move because its very
hard to avoid. Look in the followups section for more information
about this move.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Kunai Murder (b+2)
usage(***)
damage(22)

  Not as good as her Kunai Advance but it is still a good
unblockable. You should use this in close range and a
d+3 is 100% guaranteed.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Kunai Advance (f,f,N+2)
usage(*****)
damage(25)

  Best unblockable she has! The foward movement just make your
opponent block and this move comes extremely fast. Also, a
d+3 is 100% guaranteed. Use this a lot and don't ever
forget about his move. I will try to do more research
on combo off this move.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Kunai Recovery (b+1+2)
usage(****)
damage(8,11)

  Kuni swing her blade twice afront of her in a really cool
motion. The first hit is blockable and the second is unblockable.
Sad thing is that the second hit never connects if the first
is blocked. This move, however, is for incoming opponent who
like to rush things. They will walk right into this. Also, I
believe a poison wind is 100% guaranteed after this move.. but
I'm not sure.. more research must be done on this move.

-------------------------------------- Ten String ------------

Kuni Ten (121:4::4:4::1::2:3:2)
usage(**_*****)
damage(not sure yet)

  I gave this ten string two different scores. The first score
is for the entire string which I wouldn't suggest you using
it to the end. However, you could use all nine of the move
and end it with a Kunai Recovery (b+1+2) to fool your
opponent. Just be sure to get ready to chicken a few of
the moves in between.
  The second score is for the first three hit. They are so
USEFUL! Seriously, they are super fast and can almost
interupt anything. Furthermore, seems to me that if the first
hit connect, the last two is 100% guaranteed no matter
what! Extra damage, how sweet is that? My little grasshopper,
use this move often for poking and just annoy you opponent
with it. Don't worry about recovery because it is so fast
that is sexy.


-------------------------------
-  Basic & Hardcore Strategy  -
-------------------------------

  Many people are confused with the idea that Kuni is basicly
Yoshimitsu's double. This is wrong! Kuni should never be played
like Yoshimitsu. Her style is way more different and shouldn't
be some other character's shadow.
  First of all, Kuni has many unblockable... they are there
for something.. so USE IT! At least five time per round. So what
you are being called cheap, at least you won and murdered your
opponent, that's all that's matters here. Second of all, unlike
Yoshimitsu, Kuni consist of many knock down move that can't
be tech rolled out off(This includes her unblockables). This
means that every move has a followup! You must remember these
100% guarantee followups and use them everytime when the first
hit connects. I will explain about follow up in the combo
section below.
  Next, Don't ever try to turtle with Kuni, she isn't made
for turtling. When playing Kunimitsu, you should know that
there is no blocking for your opponent(with all her
unblockables) and you should charge with full force. Try
mixing all her move a little and do custom string and poking
while try to add as much unblockable in it as possible.
  I did always suggest to mix in some of her solar kick
chain. They are wonderful damage tool and the poke pretty
well two to keep you on the safe side. But when ever you
get a chance.... JUGGLE! One of Kuni's Juggle alone can
take half of your opponent's life away. This will definitly
make them change team mate.. and... do it again! I will
show you some of her deadly juggle in the section below.


-------------------------------
-  Followups, Custom & Juggle  -
-------------------------------

The following section is the followups... You need to imagine
them not as juggle but as "one" entire move. They should be
chained together by the reaction the first move cause(either
hit or blocked). Try to remember all of them as they are
all 100% guarateed... oh yeah, I took the libraty of naming
all of them so is easier for you to remember them(also fun
for me ^_^). I will try to find more of these types of moves
but for now.. here they are.. REMEMBER: A SINGLE MOVE!

--------------------------------------- Followups ------------

Manji Leaf-Falling Combo (SS+3+4,u/f+3+4)
connect(first move must hit)
damage(36)

  This should be treated just like Paul's falling leaf combo.
And basicly, is the samething. Kuni just spins on the
ground and stomp on her opponent. The last move is 100% guaranteed
and there is no lag in the animation so that it looks
very smooth. You shouldn't even hesitate after the SS+3+4 and
should go for the poison wind automaticly.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Fox Pounce (FC_d+3+4,u/f+3+4)
connect(first move must hit)
damage(49)

  Aaahh.. The fox pounce. Wonderful move that cause the same
damage as a Death Fist... Almost as strong like a counter
Death Fist if it was also countered. Personally, I use this
move often because it cause so much damage and not many of
my opponent realizes it. Furthermore, like above, the animation
runs very smoothly that it look like a single move. Earns lots
lots of style points!

--------------------------------------------------------------

Kunai Trap (f+3+4,3,Throw)
connect(first move must block)
damage(30_35)

  At first when I played Kuni, I find that the move f+3+4 wasn't
all that useful. The reason is that you can't really juggle
with it in the arcade version. However, I notice that the computer
rarly block this move for some strange reason. Finally, I finally
saw the wonderful block stagger with this move and started
to try different things. I have concluded if you end a zig-zag(3),
only the first kick, you will get another block stagger that
is long enough for a guarantee throw. However, you must be
very fast to execute the 3 so that your opponent won't duck.
This will finally end up where your opponent would stagger to
the right side first and to the left... or vice versa. Either
way, if your opponent block or not... he or she will get some
damage shoot off of their life bar.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Wood Splitter (u+3+4,u/f+3+4)
connect(first move must hit)
damage(46)

  This move is like the Fox Pounce with a few damage differences
and that is unblockable. Don't even bother with a juggle after
this move and go for the poison wind. It shouldn't be a reation
but a habit. Good style points!

--------------------------------------------------------------

Tricky Fox (BK 3,4)
connect(first move must hit)
damage(42-48)

  Kuni would flip backward and the last 4 kick is 100%
guaranteed. This move shouldn't be treated as a juggle but as a
full move. Try to do the last 4 very quick or it won't
connect.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Double Pison (ws+2,f,f+2)
connect(first move must hit and stuns)
damage(32+)

  The first move will stun your opponent which they would
walk backward. This is your chance to do a guarateed f,f+2.
However, you have to do this move really quick or it won't
connect. After it you can finish it with some of your
most damaging juggle.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Fox Thrust (U/F,N+4,f+3+4)
connect(first move must hit and stuns)
damage(50+)

  Alright, you might think that this move is hard to pull off
of but it is actually not. The first part U/F,N+4 is very
easy to counter off which your opponent would sit there stunned.
Than finish it off with a Growling Jewel for a Death
Fist damage.

----------------------------------------- Custom ------------

Custom combo is very important in Kuni's way of fighting. Try
to come up with your very own original custom combo so that
your opponent(who might read this FAQ) can't guess what your
doing. Furthermore, try to put more unblockable in your
combos because most people can't catch it. Here is an example:

b+1 => d+1 => rise b+2

backfist => low punch => kunai murder

This one almost always catch your opponent of guard as usually
they are waiting for a ws game but get a unblockable instead.

Furthermore, I did suggest you always... ALWAYS grrr add the
backfist into your custom string. Some people might argue
with me that it is wrong to do so. However, the backfist
is a very fast move... if it hit.. GREAT if it dosn't, it will
make your opponent very nervous and they don't know what you
will do next. Here are two more example:

b+1,1,1,1,1 => d/f+2

backfists => uppercut

b+1 => d+1 => ws+4 => b+1,1,1,1,1 => d/f+2

backfist => low punch => rising kick => backfists => uppercut

This is for opponent who ducks down when you do the backfist.
End it with an uppercut for some easy juggle. With the frame data
you should be alright. Don't worry about their ws game because
most of the time your opponent would be too nervous because
there don't seem to be any gap.

b+1 => 1 => b+1 => d+1 => rise b+1,1 => Throw

backfist => punch => backfist => low punch => backfists => throw

It is always important to add in your throw in a custom
combo. Your opponent will never guess it and it will earn
you some style point. Here is a easier cheesy one:

b+1,1,1,1,1 => Throw

backfists => Throw

This always works because you can mix up with your uppercut
to confust your opponent. EXCAPE IS FUTILE!

Here is another few custom combo that started by a different
method.

f,f+3+4,3 => d+1 => rise b+2

Solar Kick, Reverse Kick => low punch => kunai murder

The Solar Kick strings are very good custom string starter.
This goes for both the Reverse Kick and the Solar Dive(1+2)
which leaves you in a good position for a d+1 poke.

b+1 => d+1 => ws+4 => f,f+1+2 => Throw

backfist => low punch => rising kick => reverse solar kick => throw

This is a combo where you chain a Solar Kick in the
middle of combo with a throw when your opponent is waiting
for a block.

b+1,1 => 2,d+3 => FC,d/f+3

backfists => punch, low sweep => Trip Sweep

This custom combo hits low twice which is always a plus.
Furthermore, most people would expect a Trip Sweep after
a d+1..... not what I have listed above.

----------------------------------------- Juggles ------------

Alright, I will only list a few things in this section since
you can almost get juggle info everywhere on the net. What
I'm going to list is a few that you should use most and
the most damaging ones.

--------------------------------------------------------------

f,f+2 startup

b+1,1 => b+1,1,(1),(1),1 => 3

Two backfists => Five Backfists => Zig-Zag

damage(70+)

This is Kuni's most damaging juggle which takes off like
around half of your opponent's health. REMEMBER THIS JUGGLE!
Furthermore, this juggle can also start with d/f+2. Just
remember that you need to nuetral for a second than start
it so that your opponent can drop down a little for
it to connect correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------

d/f+2 startup

f+3+4 => 1 => 3

Growling Jewel => Punch => Zig-Zag

damage(70)

Another very damaging juggle, however, it is very hard to
connect the other kicks. Much practice is need for this
juggle to work, but if you master it... no one can stop
you from a fast victory.

--------------------------------------------------------------

FC,d/f+3 startup

ws+4 => d+4_d+3

rising kick => low kick

damage(34+)

This is a small juggle however it does almost the same damage
as the D/B+3,3,3,3,3,3 and is much easier to execute. It is
very sad that Kuni can't do any damaging juggle after this
move.... sigh.... WHY NAMCO?

-  Partners  -
--------------

Is time to pick your team mate! Who should you get, you ask?
Will I'll tell you my little grasshopper. Kuni can almost
go with anyone, but I do have a few favorites to point out.
The sad part is that she don't have any start or end special
graphic with anyone. :_:

--------------------------------------------------------------

Innocent Assasin Team
Kunimitsu / Ling Xiaoyu
Rate(*****)

  The two fastest player in the entire game. Why not? Xiaoyu
is a extremely strong character. She is very hard to grasp
at first(I'm going to write another FAQ about her later) but
when you master her, like me, no one can stop you! Mwahahaha!
I like to use Xiaoyu as my launcher. My strategy is evade
everything that the other player is throwing at me. Afterward,
when I get behind them, I would knock them in the air
so that Kuni can come in and finish off with one of her super
juggler.
  Now I'm guessing you are asking why don't I just use Xiaoyu
to finish off with her juggles? Will here is why... I am
more of a person who think about "guarantees". I have compared
with Xiaoyu and Kunimitsu's juggles and concluded that Kuni's
strong ones are much easier and safer to land off than
Xiaoyu's. Furthermore, you will get a lot of style points
as you do this. Also, the more you switch with your partner, the
more the chances you will win. At least you can do it while
your opponent is in the air.... or do you raither switching
your partner and let your opponent hit you with a counter
death fist?

--------------------------------------------------------------

Assasin Bitch Team
Kunimitsu / Anna
Rate(****)

  Anna basicly has everything. Power move, reverse, throw
reverse, combo, juggle, and ground moves, you name it she has
it. Furthermore, her rushing combo is amazing as that no
one will guess what your last move could be(hard to explain
but I will... someday). Anytime if I see a stupid King
scrub, I would use Anna as I enjoy to see their face when
they try to multi-throw me. hehehehe

--------------------------------------------------------------

Cold Heart Team
Kunimitsu / Bryan
Rate(****)

  Bryan is a character that can do big damage in a short periods
of time. I enjoy his juggle very much because most of them
are 60+ damages. Furthermore, he is the ultimate poker and
not one seem to stop all his high low pokes.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Manji Team
Kunimitsu / Yoshimitsu
Rate(***)

  Isn't this obvious? This is what I considered the fun team.
I always like to use this team if I'm feeling good and want
to humiliate my opponent to death. One of my favorites is
try to win the first round and finish the last round with
a suicide. This is very hard to do as most people won't catch
your suicidal attempt everytime. Yes! I have don't this on
EVERYONE! Even the real real real good players... Darkmanx and
Mr. Horrible just to name a few. Mwwahahahahaha!!!... lol j/k
sorry guys... didn't want to make you look bad j/k



----------------------------
-  Against other fighters  -
----------------------------

Vs Jin
Rate(Hard)

  A good Jin player is pretty hard to beat because Jin dosn't
really lack anything. However, that dosn't mean that he is
unstopable. You need to watch out for his damn god fists and
tooth fair. One whiff from your side... you can eat it
and prepare your funeral. Thanks god that Kunimitsu is a
fairly small character and that some stronger juggle won't
matter on her. Also, you need to watch out from his b+4. This
move will stun you if its countered and could also lead
into some horrible juggles.
  I would suggest you do poke at first to see if this person
is a Jin master first. If he is, try to juice up all the
unblockable as you can with some followups. Don't forget
about the SS+3+4 followups(Manji Falling-Leaf Combo) which
always comes handy with anyone. Also, if Jin whiffs, don't
even hesitate to juggle him or turn him around for some
big damage. Oh, one last thing, remember to switch often
if there is a chance because the more you switch to
regain health... the better chance you will win.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Vs Lei
Rate(Hard)

  Lei is also a pretty hard character to deal with. Mainly,
watchout for his punch rush(f,N+1,2,1,2) which can lead
to a guess low or high kick. Furthermore, us planty of
b+1+2 unblockable to stop him from advancing. When ever
Lei gets on the ground in close range, do a poison wind! This
especially effective on some of his move that leaves him
on the ground. For example, Lei's ground rolling kick (4~4,
3,4). If you leave Lei on the ground, you might have to
end up guessing what he will pull out against you. Oh yeah,
grasshopper, don't ever forget to d+1 when ever Lei changes
his stance and in close range. This way, he won't get any
chance of tricking you with one or more of his stances.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Vs Paul
Rate(Hard)

  There are basicly three main things that you need to look
for in a Paul player. Number one, the Death fist which can
kill you in second. Number two, his shredder which leave you
in the hair for more damage. Finally, the falling leaf combo
which leaves you guess and on the ground for more bashing.
  I suggest you attack Paul with full force without too much
poking envolved. Use minimum custom combo because one counter
from a death fist can mean a lot of damage. You can use d+1+2
to avoid most of his move and juggle him when ever you
gets a chance. Also, don't forget to use your turn around
fist when he whiffs for some major damage.
