*Introduction*
**************

This FAQ is for all those players who use King or want to use him and know more
about his multi-throws.  I bet the reason we all use this Mexican wrestler
is for his multi-throws.  If you want to know about his other moves, you won't
find them here.  Check out the other King FAQs.  This one focuses on his              multi-throws.

I'm writing this because after all, these are Frequently Asked Questions.  Well,
FAQ can mean other things, but there could be children reading and I've already
corrupted enough youths.

I'm assuming that you know the conventions such as 1_2 and so on.  Here's just
a rundown on all the buttons and directions.  I think the illustration below

*******
*What?*
*******

A multi-throw is a series of throws executed on an opponent.  After the starter,
a series of buttons are pressed so that you will perform another throw on your
victim.  This is also known as a chain throw.

******
*Who?*
******

There are 4 people in Tekken Tag Tournament that I know who can execute them.
They are King, Armor King, Nina, and Bruce (I've never seen it happen).  For
this FAQ, I will be discussing King's multi-throws.

******
*Why?*
******
 
Do we really have to ask here?  You all have your own reasons, but one thing's
for sure, THEY LOOK SO COOL.  This is why I started using King in the first
place.  Most result in heavy damage and can win you matches out of nowhere when
it looks like you're down and out (Believe me, I've come from behind and then
won games with these).

Multi throws will give you that psychological advantage.  It makes your opponent
look like your bee-yahtch while King's having his way with their fighter.
Getting caught in these can be frustrating and throws people off their game. I've
been called cheap for doing these repeatedly, but we all should know these aren't
cheap since there's a chance to escape the majority of them.

The object in these throws isn't only to do the most damage possible.  You should
always try to complete each series executed.  The only way you can get that psychological edge is to complete each sequence in the throws.  This is why it
can be a pretty good idea to go for uncommon but low damaging links instead of
that lethal common one from time to time.  

******
*How?*
******

Here are all of King's multi-throws.  There are about 6 of them, but I won't
add the Irish Whip (chances are, you'll only use it as a tag in with Armor
King).  Some are good, some are bad.  Though the names differ from each
one in each FAQ, I will be using the pro-wrestling terms for the moves if I
know them.

Now for the chains...

Throw Chart (Reverse Armdrag Take Down or Gory Guerrero Special) 
 
A-------C-------F-------G-------I
        |               |        
        |               --------J
        |                   
B-------D-------------G---------I
        |             | 
        |             ----------J
        |
        -----E-------H--------I
                     |
                     ---------J

A. Reverse Arm Drag Take Down (f,df+1+3_2+4) 25 (1_2 depending on command)

This path leads you to King's longest and most damaging chain, but it isn't
really a good series.  If your opponent tried to break the initial start up,
chances are, they'll escape the next throw.  I can't really do the throw and
it's one I stay away from.  Doesn't it look like Paul's shoulder throw?  (**)

B. Gory Guerrero Special [GGS] (SS+2+4_df+1+2_df+DF,2+4) 28 (1+2)

Probably the multi-throw starter you'll see most often, especially the
side step version.  You'll see scrubs do that most often.  The side step
version is cancellable by tapping b, which ironically, can be more useful
than the actual throw.  The (df,df,2+4) will only catch a crouching opponent.
On a side note, this is a real move invented by Gory Guerrero and currently
used by Shane Helms of WCW aka the Vertabreaker.  (***)

C. Backdrop (2,1,1+2) 18 (1_2 same as A)

If your opponent couldn't escape the Reverse Arm Drag, all they have to do is
tap the other punch button to escape.  In other words, it's the same escape
as the Reverse Arm Drag.  Looks like the suplex counter off a side headlock on
tv.  (*)

D. Cannonball (2,2,1+2) 18 (2 only after Backdrop)

This move is guaranteed after you do it from the GGS.  Not much to
say here.  Buffer the move to increase the chances of doing it.  Tap 2
twice and hold it then tap 1.  You'll get this move if you tried a SS
GGS, but caught them on the side or from behind.  (*** add 2 off the GGS)

E. Inverted Atomic Drop (3+4,1+2,1+2+4) 17 (2)

Common move you see in wrestling.  This is the scrub's move of choice (or at
least they know) after the Cannonball.  Taking this path results in greater
damage, but this is one sequence most people know.  (***)

F. German Suplex (3+4,1+2) 18 (1)

It looks better on TV and by Chris Benoit.  Can't comment much 'cause I've
never done it in a match.  At least it's follow up is inescapable when you
use this.  (***)

G. Powerbomb (1,2,3+4) 22 (1 only after Cannonball)

Nice standard wrestling powerbomb.  More damaging than the Inverted Atomic
Drop, but only 1 follow up after that.  Some reason, I connect with this
part of the sequence more often than the Inverted Atomic Drop.  (***)

H. Sit-down Powerbomb (1,2,3+4,1+2) 20 (None)

Different looking powerbomb, but at least it's inescapable.  This and the
Inverted Atomic Drop adds up to more damage than the Powerbomb, plus it
has one more move to go.  (****)

I. Giant Swing (2,1,3,4) 27 (1)

Move you see in old school wrestling, women's wrestling, and midget
wrestling.  Not as much damage as the other follow up, plus it can be
tech rolled.  To make matters worst, this is the most common follow-up
and the one scrubs use most often.  Do it only when your opponent
escapes the Muscle Buster often, expects a Muscle Buster, or just taps
2 when caught in a chain throw.  (***)

J. Muscle Buster (3,1,2,3+4,ALL) 35 (2)

Most damaging final move of this series.  Looks cool and you can follow
it up with a Moonsault or a Blind kick.  I normally go for this move,
but there are times when people will break it.  I don't think it's
possible for someone to execute this move on TV, but I could be wrong.
(****)


Throw Chart (Jaguar Driver [a weird looking Pedigree-like maneuver])

A-------B
|
|
|                   
--------C
         
A. Jaguar Driver (qcf+1) 25 (1_3+4 during)

What an awful move.  Less damage than a standard King throw.  One to stay away
from.  I only do this by accident when trying a Giant Swing command.  Shame on
you Namco!  (*)

B. Pedigree or Dominator (1+2 during A.) 30 (Same as A.)

Whether it's Triple H's or Faarooq's move, this version sucks.  So it's 5
more points just to change the throw, but a standard King throw does more.
Stay away!  (*)

C. Boston Crab (1+2,3,4,1+2) 25 (none)

It adds 25 more, so if you get caught doing A, go for this one.  (**** only
because it's guaranteed, but this chain still sucks)


Throw Chart (Standing Heel Hold)

A-------B------E        
|        
|                   
--------C
|
|
|
--------D

A. Standing Heel Hold (CD+2+3) 30 (2)

My personal favourite of the chain throws.  Decent initial damage and the
follow ups will guarantee you at least 60 damage in total if you get one them.
The only setback is, if the followups are escaped, you will eat 10 damage.  
Do it and you'll see why it's the preferred throw.  (****)

B. Indian Death Lock (1+2,1,3,1+2) 30 (1+2)

Nice lock, adds up to 60 damage, double button escape, and there's one more
inescapable move to go.  Great move, but don't do this too often or your
opponent might get smart about it.  (****)

C. STF (1,2,3,1+2) 35 (1)

The submission of choice for William Regal.  Looks nice, least damaging
follow up though.  I only use it when I know one more follow up will finish
the guy.  Good for mix ups too.  (***)
 
D. Scorpion Death Lock (1+2,3,1,1+3) 40 (2)

This name makes much more sense than the Sharpshooter.  Plus Sting did it
first.  Of the follow ups from A, this is the most damaging, but it ends
here.  I use this when I don't feel like doing the STF, but the 2nd lock will
finish the opponent.  Looks cool when you get the 4x ending animation.  If
your opponent keeps tapping the 1+2 buttons during hold A, switch up to
this one.  (****)

E. Romero Special (1,3,4,1+2,3+4) 50 (None)

Looks awfully painful, most damaging, and inescapable.  There's no reason
why you shouldn't do this move, unless hold B kills them.  Looks cool
during the 4x death replay too.  (*****)


Throw Chart (Arm Breaker)

A-------B-------E
|            |           
|            ---F
|                   
--------C-------G
|        
|        
|
--------D
          
A. Arm Breaker (CD+1+4) 20 (1)

Name says it all.  I only do this move if my opponent escapes the Standing Heel
Hold repeatedly.  Other than that, I don't try this often, unless I'm gonna
show off as well. (***)
 
B. Cross Face Chicken Wing (2,1,1+2+3) 25 (1+2)

Decent move, double button escape, and has most damaging follow up.  It's
really easy to do if you buffer.  Hold 2, hold 1, tap 3.  It's that simple.
Too bad it's a well known prerequisite for a well known move.  (***)

C. Side Russian Legsweep (1+2,4,2+4) 20 (2)

Looks cool and it's follow up is inescapable.  I'm not sure if people know
about this move since the majority of the time, you'll see a Cross Face
Chicken Wing.  Honestly, of this series, I go for this unless I'm playing
a guy who has absolutely no idea about the Rolling Death Cradle.  (***)

D. Triple Arm Breaker (1+2,1+2) 25 (1)

Stay away.  Looks bad, plus it's just as easy to do B and it does the same
damage, but there's no follow up for this move.  (*)

E. Dragon Sleeper Hold (2,1,3,1+2+4,1+2+4) 30 (1)

Nice follow up and guarantees you one more shot at your grounded opponent.  Do
this when your opponent will try and break a Rolling Death Cradle.  (***)

F. Rolling Death Cradle (1+3,3+4,2+4,1+2,1+2+3) 75 (2)

Coolest looking move and most damage in the least amount of moves.  
Unfortunately, this is a well known move.  Every expert in the Tekken community
knows about this move and can break it.  This is a really difficult move to
execute because of it's sequence.  I can get it about 3/4 of the time with my own     sequence.  Here's how I do it: I press 1+3 with my trigger finger and thumb,
3+4 with my trigger and bird flipping finger, 2+4 with trigger and thumb, 1+2 
with the trigger and bird and hold it so I can just press 3 with my thumb.  This 
takes a lot of practice to do it.  (**** only because of style and damage)

G. Arm Crucifixion (4,3,4,3+4,1+2) 25 (None)

I can't see why you shouldn't go for it since it's inescapable and you can do
a Stagger kick after that.  (*****)

  
Throw Chart (Ultimate Tackle) 

A-------B-----------G
        |    |                   
        |    -------C----E           
        |    |
        |    -------D----F
        |          
        C-------E
        |        
        |        
        |
        D-------F

A. Ultimate Tackle (WC, df+1+2_WR_CD+1+2[df must be held]) 5 (2_1+2 to reverse)

A move I'm not too fond of doing since it can be reversed leaving you at
your opponent's mercy.  (**)

B. Punches (1,2,1_2,1,2) 5 per punch (1 if started with 1_2 if started with 2)

Not much to stay, just a standard mount and punch.  I prefer to stay away from
this move since it's easily blocked.  (**)

C. Cross Arm Lock (1+2) 25 (1+2,2,2,2,2...)

Standard arm submission.  I've seen Royce Gracie win many matches in UFC using
this move, but this is Tekken, not UFC.  Easy to do, but can be reversed by those
with an arm lock followup.  (***)

D. Cross Leg Lock (3+4) 25 (1+2,1,1,1,1...)

Same as C, but you're doing this to a leg.  I prefer this one since no one
really sees it and it has a really cool follow up.  (***)

E. Arm Breaker and Arm Twist (1+2,1+2) 10 (None)

Just like all inescapable followups, you should always do this.  (*****)

F. Arm Breaker to Cross Face (1+2) 40 (None)

Same as E but a bit harder to do.  The way I do it is while King's starts going
for the D, tap 1+2, but hold 2 and keep tapping 1.  Looks cool too.  (*****)

G. More punches (1,2_2,1) 5 per punch (same as A)

It's the same as A.  Refer to that.

*******
*When?*
*******

Just because you now know how to do these moves doesn't mean you're a master.
You have to know when to use multi-throws in order to be successful with them.
If you keep trying them, chances are you're gonna get nailed.  So when?

If you're fighting a reversal scrub, you'll land a CD series on them quite
easily.  Once that has been established, the scrub won't reverse anymore
which opens you up to smacking them with moves.

If the game turns into something like just trading blocked hits (most likely
against a scrub using the death fist), crouch dash in and have your way with
them.

If you're fighting a turtler, force them to use standing blocks by using mid
moves like d+1,N+2.  This will open them up to all sorts of throws.

Establish a good poking game.  Using moves such as (d+1,N+2) will give you
good openings and make them use standing block a lot.  Poke your opponent with
a few high and mostly mid moves (don't forget to chicken).  This forces people
to continually use standing blocks and open them up for throws.

Mix up your crouch dash game.  Keep your opponent guessing if your King will
be going for a chain throw series, just a Black Bomb, Konvict Kick and moves
buffered from a CD, or even a crouch throw.
 
If I've been playing against a guy who's been scouting me or people watch me
rack up a little win streak, chances are, they'll be begin the round with a
block because my 1st move is usually a (d+1, N+2).  Here's a chance for me to
utilize a CD series and get an early lead.  It's not always true depending on
the opponent's skill level.

It's said often, but do it when least suspected.  Really, I don't go for
chain throws that often.  If my calculations are correct, on a good player,
I'd attempt a chain throw 20% of the time.  It really depends on the type
of player I'm fighting.  When people see you pick King, the first thought
would be his chain throws.  Take advantage of his other attacks and after a
while, they won't think of his chain throws.....until you do one.

If you're playing against a pitbull or even a button mashing scrub, don't
bother doing one.  You'll get nailed with random hits and it just won't do
any good.  You're better off counter hitting them or whatever.

Another questions being asked was...WHEN DO I INPUT THE COMMANDS?  For the
first move, right when King grabs the guy with the starter, input the next
possible command.  If you can hear the sound of slams or broken joints, if
not, right after you see the impact or the twist, start doing the command.
You can do it anytime after that point but only as long as you input it
before the current move causes damage.  Relax, you have plenty of time
(even for the Rolling Death Cradle).  You only have to do it once.  That
way, it makes you look like a seasoned pro (if you're not), show off, and
your opponent only has 1 chance to read your fingers.  You can press it
repeatedly if you don't feel comfortable that you did it right.  I do that
when if I'm playing at an arcade I'm not familiar with or has crappy button
registers.

***************
*Breaking them*
***************

It's one thing doing them, but when you get caught in them, you should always
know what to do.  King is infamous for his chain throws.  Every good player,
decent King user, and expert knows them inside out.  It's good to know them,
but breaking them doesn't end there.  Nobody likes to get caught in his
multi-throws and I'm no exception.  Here's a few things to do if you ever
find yourself in one.

If you're playing a beginning King player or a King scrub (Shame!) chances are
they'll be going for the highest damage move in the sequence if they can do one.
Example:  You somehow got caught in a GGS.  You can't do anything about
the Cannonball, so when your opponent goes for the next move, chances are, it
will be an Inverted Atomic Drop.  Solution here is to press 2.  Escape!

Good players will always mix up the throws.  If you're playing at an arcade
that has the controls side to side, not the Battleship format, look at their
fingers for the next throw.  I don't know why many people don't do that, since
they'd rather mash every button and wiggle 'n' jiggle the joystick.  That just
looks silly.  Example: You're caught in the Standing Heel Hold.  Look down and
see what your opponent is pressing.  If you see the right fingers press (1,3),
chances are, you're gonna be caught in the Indian Death Lock.  Press 1+2 now!
-
On a side note, you should do the same when initiating a chain throw as well.
Watch your opponent's fingers and watch which button(s) he's pressing.  If
you see them going nuts on either 1 or 2, then go for the other link.  Ex:
You execute a Cannonball from the GGS, you see your opponent jabbing the
2 button.  Then go for the Powerbomb.  This only works on scrubs and
beginners.
-

Most importantly, the best way to break a chain throw is simple evasion.  
You'll never get caught in a Rolling Death Cradle if your opponent can't land
the Arm Breaker.  Soooo...just duck (But watch out for the Black Bomb off a
CD or a crouch throw or whatever).

*Final Words*
*************

This FAQ wasn't that difficult to write.  Unless I get real bored and start 
using someone else or have reached my maximum potential with King, this FAQ will
never be finished, especially the When to use them part.  Always feel free to
write (email's at the top of the page) and you will receive credit for any
contributions.  Just because I am teaching others out there how to do
Multi-throws doesn't mean that I won't learn anything here.

If you ever catch a guy in a multi-throw and you see them going mad on the
stick, please tell them that doing that is useless and to stop it.  Nobody likes
to play with damaged joysticks.

If you've just started using King or are currently learning him, please do not
use this FAQ as the basis of your game plan.  I suggest that you read the other
King FAQs on this website where ever it's found.  You must learn the basics of
King before you can get into his chain throws.  It's possible to beat other
players without the use of his multi-throws and you'll find yourself beating
people more often with punches and kicks than with slams and locks.  When you
play better opponents, you'll be using these less.

Another section for multi-throws is Catlord's site.  If you've been reading
other Tekken related FAQs, you'd probably know Catlord by now.  Check out his
site for more multi-throw info and other Tekken related information.  If you're
really into the Tekken story, read the Tekken Committee fanfic.  Pure hilarity.

I am not the greatest King player in the world or even in Toronto for that
matter.  I can't even do his throws 100% of the time.  I'm sure there are some
readers out there who can beat me using King or even my King/Armor King combo.
In the Tekken Central forum, I use the alias Naked King.  GameFAQs forum I'm
Mini King.  If you're from Toronto and you know Honda, Pascal, or the Tekken Crew,
then they can tell you who I am.  Lately, I can only play at York.  You'll know
who I since I am the only one that I know who picks King/Armor King.  I play
around in Toronto, but I don't have an arcade that I play at exclusively.
