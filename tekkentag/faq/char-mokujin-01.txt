Mokujin stances   ver 1.4           By Mohil Rai Ramadhan
Tekken Tag Tournament

This document is best read in a monospace font (eg. Courier New). This FAQ is designed to
help Tekken addicts like myself to better identify one of the most underrated and
unpredictable characters in the game. Mokujin is my favourite character in the game
because it allows me to use as wide a range of moves and knowledge as possible. Plus it's
pretty impressive to see someone playing Mokujin and not fumble around trying out
different moves or trying to get him to stand still for a couple of seconds just to
figure out who Mokujin is impersonating.

Ok, there are two ways to figure out who he's impersonating at the start of the round.
Firstly, in the first round of a fight, he'll do a pre-fight "warmup" manoeuvre. This is
different for each character. There are two different warmups for each of the Tekken 3
characters, and one for the Tekken 2 characters.
Secondly, each character has a different fighting stance from every other character. In
all other rounds after round one, the character will not do a pre-fight "warmup". So
you'll have to identify him/her by the stance.

NB: Mokujin never impersonates Angel, Devil, Ogre or True Ogre. 
Also, this FAQ can also be used to identify Unknown's stances.

Terminology
===========
Full-facing: the front of the body is completely turned to face the opponent. Feet are
almost equal distance from the opponent. 
Side-facing: the front of the body is facing at a 90 degree angle to the opponent. The
feet are in a straight line with the opponent and one side of the body is covering the
rest of the body. 
Half-facing: in-between front-facing and side-facing. The body is off at a 45 degree
angle to the opponent. Front foot is closer to the opponent than the back foot, but
feet aren't lined up with opponent.

==================
I am Mohil Rai Ramadhan. I live in Johannesburg, South Africa. I've been playing Tekken ever
since Tekken 1 was released here in 1995. I discovered the benefits of Mokujin when I got
bored of playing the same character, started wondering who to choose and resorted to random
selection. I am contactable at mohilr@absa.co.za (and mohil@tekken.cc) in case you have any
questions/corrections regarding the faq.
