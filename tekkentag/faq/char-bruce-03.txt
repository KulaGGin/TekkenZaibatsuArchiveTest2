==============================================================================
2) SOMETHING TO REMEMBER
========================

Well, here is a hopefully good faq on how to use Bruce without abusing the
Three knees, if you like the three knees, then this faq isnt for you and
you can sod off. Hehehehe, well this faq is made on the way I play, wich
is very rarely juggling with bruce at all, instead it focuses on his deadly
interupt game, and his CH combos. Enjoy, and any problems - advice email
me at Grim_Walker@hotmail.com and please include your email addy with the
actual email itself, cause some servers it has Unknow Sender. =( Like AOL
for instance.

==============================================================================
3) WHATS CHANGED
================

April 14th 2001 v 1.1 - Here is a very small change, in the first addition I
                        mentioned a lot of his pokes as a little 
differently,
                        after realising that the framerates were really bad
                        and I didnt state the right moves as being the 
better
                        ones I figured this release was nessesary. 
Everything
                        else is quite the same. Cept for a few minor 
changes.
                        This might even be the last edition if no one 
complains,
                        there isnt really much else to add, cept framerates,
                        blah blah blah, wich if people ask for updates I 
will
                        add in the next overhaul, with damage etc. But 
otherwise,
                        if not enjoy and happy reading.

7) IN-DEPTH MOVE ANALYSIS
=========================

In this section, I will be listing all the moves, on a ranking system of
1-10 and telling you when hopefully they will be most effective. The
ranking system is broken into 3 parts, as shown below.

1   --
2     These moves are near useless, use with caution.
3   --
4
5     These moves are pretty much standard arsenal respectfully.
6
7   --
8     These are the moves that you should revolve an arsenal around,
9     there are no actual moves you should abuse, EVER.
10  --

==============================================================================
THROWS
==============


----------------------------------------------

1+3 [~5]            Knee Bash [Tag]        {1}

Bruces first, and most basic throw that he has.. very useful, because a
lot of the time, people want to hide from bruces mass assaults, and this
is what can help break there guard. The escape is simple, but the start
animation is the same as the 2+4. The bonus to this move is it executes
VERY quickly, bruce grabs hits and sends opponent flying, no messing around
looking good or anything. Use this when you want to stop momentum, break
an opponents guard, do quick easy damage, or want a safe and quick way to
tag. This is one of bruces 3 throws and for that reason, you MUST utalise
it whenever the need arises, do NOT abuse this move, cause your opponent
might get smart and use a constant 1 to escape, which all in all might not
be a bad thing to set up a Rib Crusher (2+4) throw, but really its not
worth it.

Its best to do this throw after something like a blocked 1,2,1 combo, you
simply dash in and 1+3, then depending on your partner, and the state of
your bruce, tag.

Bruce grabs his opponent, and sends him or her flying backward with a knee
to the face. This move is taggable, but there are no guaranteed follow ups,
very safe tag.

Ranking: 7

----------------------------------------------

2+4                 Rib Crusher            {2}

This throw looses out to the Knee Bash for a few reasons, but it only
looses one point in the ranking system. It is still fast, and as I said
before has the same start animation, wich is a good way to fool an opponent.
Basically use this throw somewhat like you would the Knee Bash (1+3)
But you cant tag off this. =( Wich is kinda sad, but this one looks way
cooler, and for style, or to humiliate your turtling opponent, land one or
two of these, with a mix up of the Knee Bash, and you should have your
opponent almost crying from the crowd pleasing smashes. ;) This is somewhat
slower, to the extent that it CAN be used in the last few seconds of a game
to hold that lifethreatening lead, but DONT use it to do any damage to your
opponent, instead it is a good way to let those seconds tick away, and watch
as your opponent frowns at you as you chunk up another great win with Bruce.
;)

Bruce grabs and holds his opponent for a moment, before kneeing them in
the chest and sending them quite a distance backwards. Good time consuming
throw, and a great mix up to the other throw to keep them guessing, non
tagable. But damn useful none the less. What you have to remember is to
use these as guard breaks, not as any seriouse strategie of damage.

Ranking: 6 (Looses 1 point for not being tagable)

----------------------------------------------

f,N,d,d/f+1+2+4     Embracing Knee        {1+2}

Ok I am breaking this up into the three multi parts, cause one is useful
to some extent the other is all but useless, the Embracing knee, comes of
a VERY slow crouch dash, and you will be very lucky to avoid much with
this against a good opponent. However, this can be used effectively I
might add, on turtlers who like to hide. It does go under high attacks,
and bruce being bruce will most likely have them blocking up down, neutral
left and right respectfully. So a sudden pause in motion often causes a
strong high hitting move or juggle starter to get at bruce. And these go
over bruce when he is in his slow ass crouch dash. Dont even THINK of
wavedashing with this, it cant cancel, and its WAY WAY WAY to slow to do
anything cool out of it but the throw. The bonus is you can go for two
options, one VERY stylie, and an easy break. The other, cool to look at
for a moment, but not really a big multi throw that will make the cround
go OOOOOOOH! Ahhhhh... and cringe, but none the less, the tumble weed has
no escape, and is currently the best option.

Bruce crouch dashes SLOWLY (you wont believe how slow till you see it)
and then grabs his opponent, before doing a good knee to the rib cage,
and releasing his, rather anoyed looking, opponent soon after, this leaves
you totally safe from retaliation.

Ranking: 3

1+2,1+2,1+2         Tumbleweed

This is the best finisher to the Embracing Knee, cause there is no escape,
most people will mash 2 because thats the normal escape, but eh hehe, there
goin for a tumble, cause this is basically free damage. And you should
NEVER miss this, the command is easy. And unfortunatly scrubs will look at
you and say "wow that was a hard multi" but thats ok, bruce isnt made for
throws.

Use this throw most of the time, cause well, there is no point in doing
the other one, unless you WANT to humiliate your opponent, and he is
looking distressed, and NOT mashing the 2 button for an escape. If your
in a tourney, and you land this on an unsaspecting turtle, I am seriouse..
tumble his ass and yell out "TUMBLE WEEEEEEED!!"

Bruce simply throws his opponent head over heels, rolling over and over,
after the Embracing Knee.

Ranking: 8 (If you can land the first part, the ranking is well worth it.
            Good damage, and ?no escape? (1) ?, what more do you ask for?)

(3_4),1+2+3         Left Knee Strike       {2}
  1,3,1+2+4           Turning Knee
   2,4,1,1+2+3         Rising Knee

This is bruces "not very well known" multi part, I say that refering to
all those scrubs who think King and Nina are the only ones with multi's.
This is a COOOOOOOOL multi if you land it. I mean, damn it looks HOT but
the escape is too easy. It is a single button escape, and anyone hitting
it can escape it GUARANTEED. I have escaped this throw, tapping on the 2
button slowly. It has a really big escape window, and if your opponent
doesnt ecape this, he deserves EVERY LITTLE BIT OF THE HUGE DAMAGE. If the
throw is escaped, your opponent simply pushes bruce off, and you are safe
from any retaliation. Not that you can hit your opponent. You have no
advantage, and you have given away free damage on the tumble weed. =(

Bruce knees them with the left knee this time, then turns them around, so
there facing the other direction, and knees them with the first knee again,
before holding them there a moment, and lifting them FAR off the ground,
releasing them letting them fly into the distance with a HUGE blow from
the second knee again. Sounds cool huh? ^.-.^

Ranking: 3

----------------------------------------------

(1+3)_(2+4)_(2+5)   HEAD BREAKER           {1}

This guy has the two COOLEST looking side throws, but I am sure you know
how to use side throws already, your SS better be good, and mix this up
with the SS+4,4 if they like ducking, else yeah duh.
Bruce grabs opponent with left arm, and with the right, he hits them
across the face with his elbow, turning his body inward, releasing the
opponents head, before hitting them AGAIN with a huge backhand from the
same arm as he hit them with, sending them flying. (And spinning!!!! ^.-.^)

Ranking: 6

----------------------------------------------
(1+3)_(2+4)_(2+5)   FACE BREAKER           {2}

This guy has the two COOLEST looking side throws, but I am sure you know
how to use side throws already, your SS better be good, and mix this up
with the SS+4,4 if they like ducking, else yeah duh.

Anna shares a very close, if not exact version of this throw, but a little
weaker compared to bruces, bruce pulls the opponent down like a rag doll,
and lifts his knee into there chests, bringing his elbow down on there
backs. Ouch. This is actually better than the other side throw, because it
leaves the opponent so close, and is VERY easy if not guaranteed a d/f+3
tornado sweep. ^.-.^

Ranking: 7 (Cause it leaves em so close)

----------------------------------------------

(1+3)_(2+4)_(2+5)   Reverse Neck Toss

This is the "generic" backthrow, I mean when namco did this throw, they
must have been really bored, cause it sucks, the damage and no escape
make it rock from behind but seriously, NO STYLE. *pokes my tongue out at
namco* Great game, crap looking throw. I am sure I can come up with
something better, like perhaps a mean ass kick in the back or something?
But nooooo.. it had to be a neck toss..

Bruce grabs his opponent from behind, by the throat, and hip tosses them
over and onto the ground. *pokes his tongue out at namco again*

Ranking: 7

==============================================================================
MOVES
==============

1,2                     1-2 Punches
  1,2                     Bruce Rush
  3_4_(f+4)               Midkick_Frontkick_Highkick

Welcome to the basis of bruces arsenal. Here we go into the indepth things.
The 1,2 is your basis move, it is done often, with a finishing combo, and
even on its own, however you should really finish it most of the time, if
you are a master, or good reflexed player, after a CH 1,2 a 2,f+4 is
guaranteed, but more on that in a moment. This is a respectful mixup,
all the punches are used all to often, and are completely safe if blocked.
I will go into each one individually to show you what I mean by all of them.

1,2                     1-2 Punches

Basis punches, as I said above, this is your start link, do this OFTEN.
I can not stress this enough, and the damage is very good, if the first
1 hits, the second hit is guaranteed. It also interupts, wich is what you
should be doing all the time with bruce, because that is your main weapon.
It can beat out almost anything, and also starts your mean custom strings,
that can rip people apart. Use one or two of these, and then land the throw
to scare your opponent out of blocking, then go in again. This is like
being hammered by an arsenal of unstopable punches, believe me. And if you
get the interupt CH! then go for a big damage kick that can be tacked on,
for DAMN good damage, or if your not sure, finish with the Bruce Rush.
This hits high, but freat not, the bruce rush and the kicks to the rescue!

Ranking: 9


  1,2                     Bruce Rush

This is bruces perfect punch rush, unlike Bryans, one hit hits on CH,
the rest is guaranteed, OR if the oppoenent is hit by the second 1, the
last 2 is guaranteed. This hits H,H,M,H. And can not be retaliated against,
its VERY fast to come out, and a lot of people will perhaps duck the 2,
and stand to block the last 1,2. This is not an uncommon thing, the point
is, I have never seen it interupted. And this is completely safe if blocked.
There is no retaliation, even on a wiff completely the lag on the last
punch is VERY small. Not that you should be wiffing, you should be in
your opponents face. Go on, get!

The damage for this is HUGE if hit on a CH, and I use this often when I
tag in, if you are an experienced player, you will do a u,u/b tag run
cancel and launch into this, I have caught a CH of many things with this,
even hell sweeps, to my suprise I might add. And I cant enphasise the
damage is HUGE.

Ranking: 10


   3_4_(f+4)               Midkick_Frontkick_Highkick

This is the mean ending that hits mid, for style, do a 3, because bruce
turns around and does a straight kick, a little slower, and easyer to see
coming, but DEFINATLY not something you can block on reaction. You will
proberbly not use the 4 as an ender, because it has a worse lag time, and
can be punished esier, leaving less options than the 3 wich knocks opponent
off there feet. The f+4 hits high, and is a good damage ender, quick recover
on this, and is hard to punish.
If you wiffed the 1,2 and think they are going to retaliate, I have seen
someone tack on the 3 knees after a counter f+4 but the circumstances for
this are VERY rare, and that was with the f+4 knocking his opponent off his
feet, the 1,2 WIFFING.

Anyway, the 1,2,3 is your best and most deadly mixup combination with
the 1,2,d+4,3 wich is explained below. This move is safe when
blocked, and should be used often wether on defence or assault.
I have killed someone with nothing but this move before, because every
time they blocked, they blocked low scared of the d+4 instead. Did I
mention that all of the above is guaranteed on CH, and leads to insane
damage? not as good as the bruce rush, 1,2,1,2 but really good none the
less. The range of the kicks is excelent also, and does big damage if they
connect on there own. These are impossible to interupt once into blocking,
so dont worry about those anoying reversals. This aplies to all of the
above so far. ;)

Ranking: 10 (9 on the f+4 cause it hits high, but recovers extremely fast)
            (6 on the 1,2,4 combo, bad recovery)
----------------------------------------------

[1],2,d+4,3             [Punch,] Punch, Sweepkick, Highkick

This is the mix up you will be using OFTEN instead of the 1,2,3. I mix this
up 50/50 and this is perhaps, nay it IS the best mix up bruce has. ;) Yep,
most definatly. The 1,2,d+4,3 is a guaranteed CH up to the 4,
and most people will fall for it in fear of getting hit by the mid 3
that they will eat this anyway. ;) When it hits, after it does, damage,
or even if the 3 is blocked, it is completely safe.
If the 1,2,d+4 with no 3 is blocked, then you have a seriouse problem.
As it has a really bad recovery on it, and you ALWAYS want to do a 3
on the end of it, with a long delay on it. That way you will catch any
opponents, who more than often want to get out of there with a WS move.

This can actually be used as okizime to some extent as
well, as the second to last 4 hits low. To use this in okizeme simply
start the combo while standing over the opponent, then do the d+4, its 
really
quite funny, and stylie I might ad. ;)

Rating: 6 ( 10 if you add the 3 on the end )

----------------------------------------------

2,3_4_(f+4)             Punch, Spinning Mid Kick_Frontkick_(Highkick)

This is the time that f+4 is THE best move to end the combo with. If the
2 hits, then the f+4 is definatly the best way to go, because that is
guaranteed  on CH, and it ?cant? be escaped if the 2 hits. Even off ch,
this is THE move to kill mishimas that have there shining fists blocked.
If you manage to block a stupid mishima shining fist.
Kill them with the 2,f+4. This is completely safe if blocked, and does
big damage, actually its as good as mishimas 1,1,2.
Accept safer. Think of it as a really safe shining fist. ;)
The 2,3_4 is when you dont think it will hit, use one of these two mid
hitting kicks to push the opponent back, or mabey even trick them into
ducking into it for some quick and easy damage. You should mix this up
with the 2, d+4.

The 2,4 is faster than the 2,3 but both are guaranteed on CH, and the 2,3
knocks opponents off there feet on a CH. Wich I might add is great time for
okizeme. As for the times to use this, it is a quick counter attack, that
needs timing to work properly.. For all you scrubs, just keep messin with
it. You will work it  out. This is really good for killing strings.. In
the middle of say.. Jins b,f+2,1,2 with a pause on the last 2

You can (If your good) land a 2,3 on CH to kill the jin and set up some
NASTY wake  up games. ;)

Ranking: 8 (The 2 jab is still slower than the 1,2 combos. ;) )

1+2                     Overhead Bomb

This looks dorky, I kinda get this when I accidentally push the 1,2 too
close together, its completely unintentional, let me assure you.

This is one of bruces many USELESS moves to an extent, Its kinda like
A. Kings knuckle bomb with more start up and end lag. It really is
that useless. It does hit mid, and CAN be used as okizeme on big chars,
but really who would want to? I mean, this move is really useless and
should be avoided like the plague. You can try it if you like, it does
crap damage and knocks your opponent over, if there stupid enough to
get hit by it, then theres something wrong with them, or the joy stick.

Ranking: 1

----------------------------------------------

f+1+2                   Spinning Slice Elbow

This move at first, I considered completely useless.. I had no idea that
it was actually good in some instances. Yes thats right. It has a *SMALL*
side step that can avoid some attacks, and is actually a very good move
to tag in with. It can catch the opponent off guard once or twice, but
dont get too cosy with it, cause it will end up costly. It hits high,
and the small sidestep doesnt really help too much.. however sometimes
if you SS or you are at a funny angle, and you are quick, this is a
great move for getting out of dangerouse situations. It spins you right
past an opponent a lot of the time, and leaves you a safe distance away.

So recap.
This is a good tag in move, on the OCCASION.
This is a good evasive move, depending on timing.
This can be used to SS small moves, or very liniar moves.
This is NOT reversable, it is an elbow.

Ranking: 5

----------------------------------------------
f+1,2,1                 Triple Elbows

This is really rather useless, I never use this, ever but it does do good
damage, and is good on taggers none the less I suppose. But I personally
think there are better options. I mean, it has BAD lag if you wiff it,
and can expect some seriouse punishment, wich would end up a real pain in
the ass if your against a good ANYTHING player, sepcially someone like
nina, whos Divine Cannon will teach you a lesson you wont forget ever.
However, if the first elbow hits on a CH then the rest is guaranteed for
good damage, and as explaind in the strats section, you often get a CH on
taggers.. The first elbow is slow.. wich is a pain in the ass, and this
isnt really good in juggles either, it cant be landed after anything 
decent..

Bah, this really isnt worth the amount of space I just gave it.
Again, if you are a better player, I found that if timing is
used properly, this is an insane priority hard hitting move. If you are
desperate it is a  good "Help" move, you should, if you use it, NEVER
stop on the first elbow, because the recovery is bad. The second elbow is
by far the safest elbow to stop on. The last elbow has quite a lag, so
then again.. The best thing for this move is to punish anyone tagging in,
because like the 1,4,3 it will hit on a counter.

Non Reversable, Non Interuptable.

Ranking: 3 (6 if used properly)

----------------------------------------------

FC,d/f,d,d/f+1          TORNADO UPPERCUT

This, believe it or not, is much like the f+1+2, it has its uses, but
really you wont land it on a good opponent, this is really good against
a blocked hell sweep,
quick damage, and mabey guaranteed, I dont know my FC, d/f,d,d/f motion
is really fast, so I dont know wether or not this is guaranteed after a
hell sweep or  not.

A lot of the time, a mishima will panic as the lag affter the hellsweep
when its blocked is atrotiouse, and often is not seen because of the 
mixups..
but none  the less, it can be done.

This is also exelent for those stupid people that do the whole ali sweep
(all 3) as to my knowledge, feel free to prove me wrong, it is guaranteed
after the last ali sweep. And does really bad damage on them.
There are only a few real uses for this move, and on the ocasion I will
use it, but other than that, you wont get a chance to use it, let alone
land it. If it is blocked, you are totally safe, as the blockstun is huge,
wich it needs to be if you get it blocked, cause bruce takes forever to get
back to his feet. If you  wiff it however, god help you cause here comes the
EWGF and there goes %50 of your life bar.

Ranking: 3-5 (Havent Decided.)

----------------------------------------------

1,4,3                   Southern Cross

This is one of his MEANEST moves, IMHO. The range is excelent, and if the
jab connects, I believe the rest is almost guaranteed. What I mean by this,
is that it takes a lot less to catch this on a CH than any of the other
moves..

I dont know how to explain this best, its CH properties are the
best out of all of Bruces moves, if the 1 hits CH then the rest of the
combo is guaranteed anyway. I will try to explain what I mean in the
strategie section.

This is the move to use to push opponents out of your range, but I have been
told that the lag on the end of this is really rather bad. I have never
personally been retaliated on, after this move, but I have heard stories of
Devils d/f+1,2 twin pistons hitting before bruce can block, and the likes
of that. Untill I clear this up, I will say that it is safe when blocked,
and proberbly THE best ender for your custom strings. It has a fast starter,
long range with the kicks and if one kick hits, the other is guaranteed.

This move hits H,H,M so you dont need to fear any retaliation from WS
moves, atleast not that I know of, and the 1,4 on its own can be used as
a really dangerouse poking device, with a fast starter. It is proberbly
as good as the 2,f+4 but then again I prefer the 2,f+4 more, cause if
I were to use the 1,4,3 I would do the whole string. But anyway,
this is the move to use when you believe you need fast damage.

The string knockes opponents down, and leaves them for Okizeme
and the like. ;)

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING
If Devil\Angel blocks this string, there twin pistons, and ONLY
there twin pistons to my knowledge is GUARANTEED on Bruce. Use
LIBERALLY.

SS+1                    NIGHTMARE ELBOW

This is his SS punch move, really quite sad compared to his SS+4,4, but
none the less, this move can be used. If it hits on CH, it quite nastilly
smacks your opponent face first onto the ground. Leaving them to lie
there a minute, looking rather dizzy and distrancted. ^.-.^ The perfect
time for a Guaranteed d/f+3 for some extra damage. Too bad the
tornado upper doesnt juggle after the d/f+3. =(

Otherwise this simply smacks the opponent across the face, and sends
them to one knee, and in a Crouch Position I might add, so dont attack
a jin after this cause youll eat the WS+2 from no were. Or a bryan
cause the ws+3 will stun you for the biggest amount of damage you
ever seen in your life.

(Side Note: You think Jins b,f+2,1,2 f,f+2 is bad for damage? Damn
you havent lost %50 of your life to bryans WS+3, b+1, 1, 3,3 ,f,f+2
before have you??)

Anyway, as I was saying earlier, this move is actually rather good to
use on people who like to crouch when you manage to get to there side.
Because it fwaps em something cronic, and well should teach them
to stand up so you can throw them. :)

But if that doesnt work, give this move a miss and go to the SS+4,4
Bull Kicks section. ;)

Non Reversable, It is an Elbow.

Ranking: 4
----------------------------------------------

b+1                     NIGHTMARE BACK KNUCKLE  *Crumples on CH*

This move is a machine for stoping momentum, find yourself caught in
a mishima 1,1 *pause* 2 ?? Then do this for a big ol CH and crumple
stun, and slap on a abig damage 4, d/f+3, b+4,3,4 for all you mean
jugglers out there and rip most of there puny useless life out of them.
Or for all you knee haters like me, just let em fall to there face, and
do a u/f+2 and laugh your head off. ;)

No this move is your main momentum stopper, it comes out fast,
hits high saddly enough, so dont use it on any crouch strings
"Eddy, Ling for instance" however this is your Hwoarang Killer.
The b+1 ducks high and some mid attacks, and comes out very fast.
Use this against strings that go on for a while, or have long and anoying
high hits to them *cough hwoarang cough* Because they are going
on and on, this is almost guaranteed to hit them for a CH. Or if you
just bash them across the face with it.. just smile and watch there teeth
fall out of there mouths.

This move is NOT safe if blocked, you can be Shining Fists after it,
!the mishima 1,1,2! so you MUST know you are going to hit it. It does
come out very fast, and does decent damage when hit. But it is not a
power move. I suppose you could use it somewhat like a reversal.. But
yeah I think you get the idea.

Some uses are when JACK is doing a 1,1,1 (Why?!?!) or something
very slow like that. Or the mishimas delay a 1,1_2. Or even if you
are very fast, and you are against and anoying Axe Kicker (mishima)
d/f+4 *PAUSE* 4 then you can actually hit the b+1 between that
to slap for a counter.

On Hwoarang this rips him appart, as soon as he goes into a HIGH
piece of his string, then hit the b+1. Really useful cause he will
hopefully be doing a string, then you will hit CH. Else, watch the
teeth as I said earlier.

This move is one of his most stylie moves to look at. the backhand is
really cool to see, and is really nasty. ;)

Ranking: 8

----------------------------------------------

d/f+2 [~5]              Face Buster [Tag]  *Juggles*
*yawn* This is scrub paradise, hit this, then b+4,3,4 repeat. This is not
useful, IMHO almost at all. I rarely use it, cause if your opponent is
ducking, which I might add is the only time you should actually use it,
then you are doing something seriously wrong, or your opponent is stupid.
This is good on a Crouching opponent, as it lifts, and tags for small
damage juggles. Nothing to spectacular. I think it feels very slow, and
as far as juggle starters go, its damage isnt spectacular.

It is hard to hit this on a good opponent, cause most will not run into such
a slow move, and will proberbly laugh in your face. I will use this in
the near future I am sure as often as I do, for those Jins that think they
are safe, but again you shouldnt be juggling very much with bruce at
all, cause thats not what hes good for.

DEFINATLY however, make it a point that it is his only Juggle Starter
that doesnt have a CH to juggle with, and if you want to humiliate your
opponent after a wiff or something, then use it.. by ALL means!
It is definatly not a bad move, I just think there are better options.
Oh and while I am here, it can not be reversed, it is an elbow. And it hits
mid. The only thing that I know can reverse this move is True Ogres
face bite FC,d/f but that can be escaped by pressing (1)

Ranking: 7 (By far not a bad move)

----------------------------------------------

d/f+1,2 [~5]            Double Face Buster [Tag]  *Juggles*

IMHO his best juggle starter, it is quick, it is two uninteruptable,
non reversable elbows, that do good damage and is safe when blocked.
I believe when this is blocked, you have full initiative, and can even hit
your opponent with a 1 *Choose Ender* on a CH if this is blocked
and they retaliate. I have even beaten out mishimas 1,1,2 after they
blocked this, and slapped them with a CH to boot.

Anyway, this move is best done when you are on an offencive, and
they are perhaps crouching. You *CAN* mix this up with the d/f+2
but the real use of this move isnt to juggle. It is to keep your opponent
standing. The juggle is just an added bonus. Because they are elbows,
anyone that thinks they are going to reverse you, is in for a suprise with
depending on your preference, a Stylie, or damaging juggle finisher.
Personally I go for style over whatever else there may be.

Anyway, what I mean, is if you are bulldogging, were bruce is VERY
powerful at, with a constant barage, your opponent will most likely
be looking for a powerful WS counter move, to duck your attacks
and slap you with a CH and\or a juggle starter. This is esily
prevented with the addition of d/f+1,2 into your strings. And can
make your opponents life litterally a living hell.

This move is also excelent for putting into an attacking opponent,
to hit the CH for the juggle, and send your opponent back so you
can lay into him or her again. Very usefull indeed.

Ranking: 9

----------------------------------------------

d/f+1+2                 Short Stepping Uppercut

As unfortunate as this sounds, this move is NOT useless, but can not
be used for anything but a juggle extender. This is good as a quick mid
hitting poke, but to be honest, it doesnt cut it VS the d/f+1 as a mid hit
poke. Quite sad really, cause this is a good move. But its a standard
uppercut. Much like  bryans WS+1+2, not totally useless, but no
real way to say its worth.. I really think I will personally skip this
move as an explanation, its best figured out on trial and error. =(

Ranking: 5

----------------------------------------------

f,f+2                   NIGHTMARE MACH PUNCH  *Reverses Punches*

This is a VERY good move, its range makes for a decenet punch, and it
reverses punches. Damn if it didnt hit HIGH and have such a strange
animation it would be a cool move.

If you hit this move, then your opponent tumbles head over heals untill
they lay face up, head towards you. Kinda strange. For an opponent
who doesnt have there wits about them, they might try and roll away
from you, so rush in and do a d/f+3, and land 3 Knees, or finish the
sweet with the tornado upper. But most people have enough brains
to stay down and take a little extra damage rather than a lot, so many
people wont get caught by that trick. ;)

Ok here we go, get ready for how to USE this move.
When an opponent tags in, if you are close, people will rush in with
Jins EWGF (This does NOT stop mishima Kaz\Hei WGF\EWGF)
or shining fists, or fast pokes to save there own life bar from depleting
in the hope of saving themselves. Not only is the range on this move
excellent, its recovery is rather good. And it has block stun. So your
blocking opponent wont retaliate. The amazing thing to this move
is the speed in which it counters punches.

When your opponent is in the middle of a string, jacks d/f+1,2,1,2
Mishimas 1,1 *Pause* 2 amd the like, then you can seriously land
this in between, really rather amazing. Its counter andimation, bruce
sorta sticks his arm somehow in there, and uses the leverage to crunch
yours, and well, it leaves you face down feet away andyway, for bruce
to pumel you with whatever he feels nessesary. And as for style,
this has MANY a time left my opponent either cringing, or the
cround jeering and going "Yeah, dats what Im talkin about" or
something of the like. It is a real croud pleaser.

None the less, I have not found any bad side to this move, other
than it hits high, but it has little lag to it, and has such long
range on it that it doesnt really matter. And you should use this
much like bruces b+1+2 for big damage.

Anyway, yeah play with this move, use it while taging in every
now and again, and use it on taggers, you really dont have much
to loose, and if you hit a CH counter on netsu, watch the damage
roll up. *hint hint*

Ranking: 9 (Its a reversal wich is why it ranks so high)

----------------------------------------------

f,f+3                   Slice Kick

This is a nasty kick. Trully nasty and does big damage if it hits. It
flings your opponent a mile, but onfortunatly its not as good as Bryans
because you can be beaten up quite badly by a fast opponent after the
kick itself. =( It stuns your opponent, if they block it.. quite nastily
I might add, leaving them gaining there senses, but the recovery on this
move is soo long that if you wiffed it, or even if its blocked, there is
nothing you can really do. It is a good move in Okizeme, and it does come
out fast. It hits BIG grounded opponents. And does EXCELENT damage on a
counter. But then again, your better off using one of his  8 Frame 1
*choose your combo* starters that do such excelent damage.

This move has its uses, and in juggles it looks excelent. And does alright
damage too.. but it is fast and hard to land, and needs practice. If this
kick hits, it flings your opponent far into the distance. Leaving him
tumbling and rolling. For style its good, and to kill taggers its great
damage.

It hits mid, and is good against anyone crouching so if you know it
will hit, by all means use it. ;) Otherwise just be careful not to overuse
and abuse it. Sometimes you can get away with using it, depending on how
you spaced yourself...

Ranking: 5

----------------------------------------------

d+3_4                   Thai Shinkick

This move is one of his low pokes, this helps *feel* out your opponent, and
is great when you just want a quick easy damage poke. That will hit low, and
hopefully go under your opponents defence. Well this is definatly it. If it
is blocked, you are safe from ANY retaliation as it is fast and dangerouse.
Use it in the midle of a string, to feel your opponent out, or to push
them back a little, and make them nervouse, showing that Bruce can attack
low just as fast as he can attack high. This can mean the end of a match
too..

If you need a little tiny bit of damage, keep hitting with this. It is
safe if they retaliate, just watch out for the ones what wait for a CH
themselves on you, because you were going for the d+4 two or three times
over.

What I am saying is use this often, just not too often enough to show that
you are going to do it, Over, and Over, and Over, cause you will be shown
up and slapped with a CH for your troubles as well. Believe me. Its safe,
not abusable. ;)

You can use this as Okizeme too, but thou it hits low, it doesnt always hit
unless your opponent moves. By this I mean, if they leave the controler
in neutral position it wont hit. But it will leave you safe from any
retaliation, IF you can predict wether a sweep or mid kick is coming. ;)

None the less, this is one of your best okizeme takticks, and not to
mention a cool juggle ender tack on. ;)

Ranking: 8

----------------------------------------------

b+3,4_2                 Frontkick, Knee_Right Punch

The b+3 is SLOW. Thats about all I really want to say about this move. The
2 is a punch that comes out at an OK speed, but it hits high, and you
WILL be punished if this isnt blocked. The 4 is a fast knee, that stuns on
CH, the knee on CH I mean, the b+3 on CH does NOT guarantee the knee on CH,
wich makes this bruces most useless string. Never use this. At first, people
did this in a juggle, b+3, b+4,3,4 for bigger damage.. but not even that is
usefull.. no just move on, go on, stop reading please,
this is TOTALLY useless.. GO! Shoo..

Ranking: 2 (For the knee CH)

----------------------------------------------

3,2,1 [~5]                Gatling Combo [Tag]  *Juggles*
          4                       Lowkick

This I actually rarely use, this is THE scrub move, they believe
this move to be GOD and it might just be for a scrub. But by far its
not as useful in high levels of play.

The 3,2,1 on CH is guaranteed for BIG damage and a good juggle to
boot, but its not likely that you will land it. If you do, then punish your
opponent fully. It is good on an agressive opponent that likes to attack
from a distance, and is actually also good on wavedashers, if you can see
them coming. Because the 3 hits mid, it is a good poke on its own.
Knocking its opponent of his feet if you do it alone, and on a CH. Otherwise
you are best to finish this combo up to the 1, because it is safe if 
blocked.
And it also hits mid. You can come in with this as an attack, but do it from
to far away you will get nailed, and destroyed so I dont advise it really.

This move is not a big part of bruces arsenal, making way for his more
destructive and faster 1 *choose comb* moves, that can do as much damage,
depending on the juggle, and is also safer.

If you ever watch a scrub playing bruce, all he will ever do all day is
3,2,1 b+4,3,4 and honestly it is really rather pathetic. The 4 at the end
is a low kick, comes out quite fast, but unlike bryan, thats his ONLY ender
to the combo. It WILL wiff if you use it against a good player.

And it does NOT juggle opponents.

Actually, I lie, you can do 3,2,1,4 b+4,3,4 on a big opponent, but WHY??
I dont see the point and personally Id rather just bash them up instead.

This combo does not lift big opponents into the air, they just sort of get
lifted off there feet, needing a little more encouragement to go into the
air, and get juggled.

However, this move is not totally useless, and is a good longer ranged
counter. If this happens on a big opponent, just nudge them with something
fast, like a 1, and they will fall over. ;)

Ranking: 9

----------------------------------------------

3,3                     Dual Spinkicks

This IMHO is actually better than the 3,2,1, as it is guaranteed on CH, and
leaves you standing with your opponents quite far away, also some people
like to try to interupt the kicks. Wich is not possible. It hits mid\high,
so in all logic it is not as good as the 3,2,1 but none the less, it is 
still
damaging and a very quick damage for those last few closing seconds of
the round. It can pose as a good keep away move as well, pushing your
opponent back, and not letting them near enough. This is also good against
wave dashers perhaps, I suppose, but then again when your opponent comes at
you, then you can anticipate and slug them with this.

I personally dont like long winded combos, and this poses much more uses
to me than the 3,2,1 does, but I suppose its all opinion. Try it out, and
see if you like it..  just dont use it often. It doesnt lag at all, and is
safe if blocked, or even wiffed.

Ranking: 8

----------------------------------------------

b,b,N+3+4,4             Handspring Backflip, Bazooka Leg

This move I currently have mixed emotions about, I dont know wether I
like it or not. I am one of the few players that like the handspring
backflip that characters like Lee, Yoshi, Michelle and the like posess..
So there isnt much to say here. Just learn to use it when you feel it
nessesary.

The Bazooka Leg is for those dumb opponents that think there going to
rush in and beat you up. Just kick em in the head to teach them
differently. You might see more here in a later update.. but
for now I am open to sugestions, or juggles.. now theres a thought.
I sometimes use the backflip into the f,f,f+3 wich is very stylie..
Very indeed.

Ranking: ??

----------------------------------------------
d/f+3,1                 Cyclone Edge, Tornado Uppercut

This move has its uses, it is somehow guaranteed on a CH or a
Major CH perhaps?

Anyway, it is excelent for taggers, the d/f+3 goes under most attacks,
and hits for a ch, and the 1 is guaranteed for good damage, sending your
opponent sailing into the distance. This is often my choice against a
tagger to do good damage to them.

And often enough, this move holds its own as an excelent move against
tags, rollers, and plain stupid offencive players. Then again, if you
wiff the uppercut, god help you cause your in a new world of pain.
Most people have been trained to block the sencond half of this,
funny that it hitting low then mid, but the block stun is enough to let
you land again, and hold a TINY bit of initiative, perhaps, if your lucky..
definatly not noticable. =(

Yeah so pretty much this is a good tag counter move, the d/f+3 makes 
excelent
okizeme on its own, as if it is blocked it has NO block stagger..
(Bruce is the MAN!)

And is safe in most cases to use freely. It does good damage too on its own,
but on a standing opponent this will never trip them up, wich is kinda sad,
but thats what you get.

Also, on anyone that recovery rolls, try to hold back from the tornado
upper if you are not sure they are going to roll. Instead, ready the 3 Knees
(Yes sad isnt it) because they will juggle off the d/f+3 if they move. And
can be delayed. Also, if you do the 3 Knees, you will go sailing over your
opponent to a safe distance on the last knee, or you can do
a d+4 on the end of two knees, so you will be safe.

More on 3 Knees later.

Ranking: 9 (For the d/f+3 alone) 6 (For the whole combo)
----------------------------------------------
d+3+4,3                 Rave Kick, High Sidekick
I have no idea, honestly, it hits low high, and quickly too, but god
knows what this move is used for, I use it as a juggle ender sometimes,
but often enough the rave kick hits and the High Sidekick wiffs. I think
its safe.. anyone? Help? I dont use it at all, and I advise you dont use
this either. Cause well, It has no use, not even as a set up I dont think.

Ranking: ??

----------------------------------------------

d/f+3+4                 STEP-IN MIDKICK

This is another horrible move, thank god it doesnt overlap anything..
cause damn this is just a waste of time. I mean, it has a CRAP start up
time, and a really bad recovery as well.. I mean, thats not the start of
how bad this move is. It is EASILY sidestepped, has CRAP priority, even
its range doesnt make up for anything, thou it does have good range..
it is really useless, not even in custom strings, I spent the whole
day trying this out, and I swear never to use it again.

Ranking: 0 (No, Go leave this part, quick, while you still have your 
sanity!)

f+4,3,4                 Triple Blind Kicks

High Mid High, I suppose this can be used as a juggle ender, it would
do good damage.. But then again, the huge question is once again, WHY.
The f+4,3,4 actually serves as a good poke, and even a time killer.
Long range the f+4,3 is proberbly your best poke.

The last 4 is useless. But if you dont do it the recovery is very good.
And can be used a lot as part of his (Keep Away) Game. You wont be dishing
out much damage with this but thats not what you are going to be using
it for. Use it to keep mishimas at bay, and prepare for there wave dash,
and also use it to kick Jacks backwards, so they cant get in to hammer
you with throws like they so LOVE to do all the time. No you want to use
this quite liberally.. make sure you know when to use it.

Learn, wiff it now and then against some people and see what happens. Its
another choose your own poke. I use it, just like I use the 3,3. But then

b+4,3,4_(d+4)           Double Knee Rush, Lunge Knee_(Lowkick)

THE MOST FAMOUSE of bruces moves, the DREADED, the FEARED the USELSS!
Thats right, I really dont admire this move as much as some people do.
I use it every now and again, as sort of a panic. But to be honest, it
has its uses, just not as a juggle as often as people use it as. The
Double Knee rush is very good. But its time to go indepth.

When doing a juggle, you can do this (Please dont) as a very easy juggle it
links to almost anything that hits the opponent for one hit, a jab, a
single f+1, a b+3, even a single b+4 knee.

But please PLEASE dont do this, its not worth it. It takes your style rating
RIGHT down, go to the juggle section if you want REAL COOL STYLE juggles.
Is is an EXCELENT wake up move, thats right. You can use this as Okizeme
to your hearts content. This is its BEST use. Often an opponent wakes up
crouching, and with the double knee, if the first b+4 connects, the second
3 is guaranteed. That is, if b+4 hits 3 is guaranteed.

This means as a wake up move, if they crouch, then the 3 hits also, doing
good damage, and leaving you with momentum. Used as a mixup with the d/f+3
this can be deadly. If your opponent rolls, and you SS first, before hiting
the b+4,3 then if your REAL lucky, you might flip your opponent sideways,
after the second knee hits in there side, you can land ANOTHER b+4,3,4 for
serouse damage. I did this a few times, and my opponents only
yell and scream at there own stupidity. It is rare but it does happen. ;)

Hehehe, yeah well the damage is too good, and as for style, 3 knees is NOT
stylie, but 5 Knees is DEFINATE STYLE. If you hit a big character, and flip
them like this, you can actually hit them with 7 Knees, that is
b+4,3 b+4,3 b+4,3,4 thats right, hows THAT for style? 3 knees my ass.

Anyway, if your opponent does not wake up you have two options. You have the
safe d+4 to hit your opponent on the ground if he moves after.. But I think
the lag on this d+4 is a little more as a combo. And rather useless...
No dont do this. If your opponent doesnt move at all, use the full 3 Knee
combo, this will send you SAILING overhead and to a safe distance.
Backturned I might add, so this is an excelent time for a tag. Or to turn
around, because you are completely safe.

b+4,3 isnt a bad move on its own, for quick damage, but the b+4 is cool to
use on its own. Its hard to explain that this is a very good poke. It has
good range, but doesnt move bruce any distance forward. This is great VS
a flash happy Yoshi. The b+1+4 I mean. And can really irritate many players,
as it hits mid for decent damage.. then again. It has no block stun, like
the b+4,3 does. None the less, neither of these can be punished.

The b+4,3 is also an excelent ground covery move, it gets you close at a
high speed, and after a lot of thinking and using it, I have decided it is
very good in CD distance to hit your opponent for half decent damage. ;)
Never use the 3 Knees alone, NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER. Got that? NEVER EVER.
So yeah you can try, if you wiff the last knee, then you are SOO dead, if
its blocked, and for some strange reason not interupted. It has BIG
blockstun, but that makes up for the REALLY bad recovery lag. ;)

Ranking: 9 ( 0 as a juggle. ;) )

----------------------------------------------

b,f+4 [~5]              RISING KNEE [Tag]  *Juggles*

This is his High Launcher, it tags, but it has a dumb tag system to it.
Have you ever done a WGF\EWGF and waited a moment, then hit the tag
button, and got that really strange sorta slow tag that you cant really
combo off? Well that is what happens with this.

This is perhaps one of the most damaging high launch juggle starters in the
game, it does big damage by itself, and as a mid hitting juggle starter its
really good. It is quite slow, so if you use it in the middle of the string,
it will seem like you have stoped completely. Then, out of the blue bruce
will lift up his big ass knee, and send you to the moon. ;)

Use this on taggers, or fiersome attackers that like to attack from a
distance. This is good for those stupid people. There are many MANY juggles
from this starter, but the funny thing is, now that I think about it, a lot
of bruces juggles launch really high.. strange. ;)

Anyway, use this on a wiffed long lag move, or if you anticipate that your
opponent will come at you, cause this will ensure that your opponent will
have a hell of a headache afterwards.

Ranking: 7

----------------------------------------------

b,b+4                   NIGHTMARE LOW HEEL KICK

This is a great move when your on the back dash defence.. it sorta trips
your opponent up, and leaves them stumbling a little.. its not really much
of a comeback move, as its sorta slow, and people noramlly see it coming,
it hits low thou, and they dont really duck when they see it coming.

If its blocked its safe.. If it hits on CH however, this is were
your momentum comes back. It trips your opponent up completely on a CH,
and gives you free 3 Knees (I can forgive you this time. ;) ) You wont get
this often, most of the time you will eat the WGF of a bulldoging mishima,
but when you have to try, do it anyway. It might get you out of a situation.
;)

Ranking: 4

----------------------------------------------

f,f+4                   Bazooka Leg

Stupidly, I use this move sometimes. ;) It has EXCELENT range, and on a long
range attacker there is no better way to make him think twice about charging
you again, but the start up lag is horendouse. And the stoping lag isnt too
good either. I use it when I know it will be blocked, and follow up
with 1,4,3 southern cross sometimes, but I shouldnt. I play for fun
thou, so hehehehehehe if it hits a stupid opponent. ;) But yeah, dont
use it.. You CAN use it to close a gap, cause the block stun us sufficient
for a good bruce player to perhaps be safe.. but otherwise forget it. ;)

It looks especially great if paul reverses it, bruce sorta puts out his 
foot,
and paul decides to spin him in circles, it cracks me up every time. ;)

Ranking: 5

----------------------------------------------

d/b+4                   SWAY HIGHKICK

This move is actually rather good against bulldoggers, if your opponent is
coming at you like a bat out of hell, then slam them with this move.
It makes sense cause this move sorta steps backwards, before stepping
forward again and kicking to the head. Damn what a headache all
these head kicks must be. Use this move when your opponent is coming
at you at a high speed, with all luck you will backdash the attack and
kick there teeth out for there efforts.

This is an EXCELENT tag in move, wich I found out, because it does an
automatic tag run cancel. If your opponent expects to nail you to the wall,
then you can do this, and teach them to stay back next time. The damage
is substantial, and it does hit high. But the recovery is very good, and
it is not likely that your opponent will hit you.

To my knowledge you can also hit apendages with this, eg poking arms or legs
that stick out a distance, for instance another bruce does d/b+4 right
before you, then you do it, there kick will come out and then yours will
hit there leg. (Hopefully) Use it often anyway, as a pause in your attacks,
or if your on defence. ;)

Ranking: 9

----------------------------------------------

SS+4,1_4                BULL KICK,LEFT HOOK_DOUBLE BULL

The SS+4,1 is useless, it hits mid then high, if your opponent is
stupid enough to get hit by the punch, then he deserves to go flying.
If you hit, DOUBTFUL, then you will send your opponent flying really
nastily. But youll never land this. ;)

SS+4,4 is Bruces BEST SS move, learn when to do it, and what side to
SS, as he does not change legs when he kicks, you can either kick an
opponent in the side twice, or in the stomach.
(Note: Everything from here is from 1p side. Anything from 2p side
is reversed. ;) )

There is a lot of use to this move, it hits mid and has EXCELENT
range to it, and it is a SS move (BONUS!) and is definatly used that way.
If you SS to his left, thats INTO the screen, then you
should plant two kicks into your opponents stomachs. If they do
anything but block during these two kicks, they will be kicked and sent
tumbling. If you SS INTO the screen, then if you are lucky, the first kick
sometimes of balances your opponent enough for your second kick to actually
connect.. and can not be blocked. This is not often. But it can happen,
and I have seen it happen. Moreso however is the properties of this
kick. Very short start up time, very long range, very short lag.
This move is GOD. ;)

Hehehe no if the first kick hits CH then the second will be guaranteed
and send your opponent flying backwards. Damn bruce is da MAN next to
Bryan who is also DA MAN. ;) The kick itself, Bruce will ALWAYS use his
right leg to do this, it doesnt matter what side you are on of your
opponent, if you SS to BRUCES left, then he will kick his opponent,
depending on how far you sidesteped.

If you step to BRUCES right side, this is perhaps his best side. ;)
He will do two hard kicks into the side. This is really remarkable,
and I said earlier if you SS far enough, then the second kick
is sometime guaranteed. It really is.. Funny to watch, and
stylie\embarising for the opponent.
I have had people complain about there joysticks not working after
doing this 4-5 times.. But they were scrubs and it was easy to do it
to them. ;) But use this move as a SS retaliation, never use the ss,4,1
because it sucks, mix this up with the side throw, and you should have a
winning combinataion of pain and suffering. ;)

Ranking: 9

----------------------------------------------

b+2+3                   Sidewinder  *Unblockable*

Unblockable, hits mid, looks cool, has excelent range, and quite a
short start up for an unblockable.

Then again, its only good for taggers, cause it does have a bad start
up.. good range thou.

Most people have enough sense however to back out of its range,
and punish it. =(

Ranking: 4 (Cause its unblockable, and BIG damage)

8) COMBOS AND JUGGLES
==========================

Here I will list juggles and even some team juggles for peoples pleasure.. I
will be accepting new juggles also, with the names of there creators,
including my own. That I have found.

Keep in mind that most of the juggles are under the names of who made them
famouse, the Generic list is a standard list of juggles that are well known.
This is actually become the Zaibtsu List. ;)

If you send me any juggle that you have not made up, I will find out.
If you see one that is yours, rightfully, and put under someone elses name,
dont email me and start flaming because your email will be delted and you
will be igrnored. Instead simply email me politely and explain what the
problem is. As of the moment the juggle list is not to long, and I will
not be adding stupid easy to do juggles that a scrub can figure out.

IE u/f+4, f+1, B+4,3,4 -= !!DUH!! =-

It is also possible for two or more people to have found the same juggle.
This is not uncommon to happen, and has done many times. This doesnt matter
I will figure something out. ;)

I will be adding damage and stuff later, if someone could go throu them and
give me a listing of damage etc, it would be much apreciated. And you will
get full credit.

9) Okizeme and Ground Games
===========================
A good point to this section, is to do as much damage to an opponent while
they are on the ground as possible. The idea is to drive him\her insane by
keeping them down, and damaging them. Unlike Anna\Nina, Bruce does not have
a huge arsenal of juggles, and destruction moves that will keep an opponent
guessing. However. Here are a few useful ones.

Ground Hitting:

d/f+3
b,b+4
FC, 3
FC, 4
u/f+2 (Insulting, it really is)

On Big Characters

d+3_4
b+4
f,f+3

Tech Rolling\Quick Recovering:

d/f+3, 1
d/f+3, b+4,3,4
d+3_4
f,f+3
1,2,d+4
1,2,3_4

If an opponent techrolls:

Then you should really be on top of them as soon as possible, landing
something like a d/f+3, or if you want to be mean, and not do as much
damage, a b,b+4. The d/f+3 juggles the opponent in this case, and can
link into either its starndard tornado uppercut, or even the b+4,3,4
(I said earlier I would forgive you this time. :) ) for damn good damge.

But if your kind like me, you will just do the d/f+3, 1 and let them go
running home to mother.

Else you can SS before they move, and slam them with 3,5,7 knees
respectfully. I already explained this part in the 3 knee section,
and I dont believe I need to explain it again. If you skiped
that section, then your still a scrub.
Go read it.. go on shew. ;)

This is a good time for the d+3+4,4 because it lifts them up and kicks them
away. ;)

A grounded opponent:

There isnt really much you can do to keep them down, other than the d+3_4
to keep them down, or the d/f+3.

If there trying to get away, do a d+3_4 and keep them down. Its not
good leaving them move. =) Yeah hes not as good as nina, INFACT if they
try to get away, do the rave kick combo, just to send them on there way. ;)

==============================================================================
10) Styles of Play
=================

This is a really big section, hopefully. I am going to add HOW to
play bruce properly in this section, showing that he does NOT rely
on his 3 Knees to do damage, and his cool ass juggles that most
people have not seen. No no, here is how to play him as each of the
3 main ways.

----------------------------------------------

Poking:

When poking with Bruce, you have to remember that his d+1 is really
long, and comes out fast after a lot of moves.
This is a big advantage to bruce, beacuse of the way you can utalise
the d+1 to really lay the hurt down to retaliation.

After a blocked pretty much anything, 1,4,3 1,2,1,2 1,2,4 or
whatever, then you want to do the d+1 to stay safe.
If you have an agressive mishima opponent, be warned that the
priority on the EWGF is very high, and most likely will send you on
your way to a big juggle if you time the d+1 wrong, in these cases you
are better to block and wait.

After a d+1, if you are even the slightest but unsure of what is
comming, even if you wiffed the d+1, do the WS+4, it is totally safe,
and is a very good move indeed. Use this often. The 1,2 combo is very
VERY important. Throw it out to feel your opponent out, and keep them
on defencive.

Examle after a successful b+4,3 you should %60 of the time use a
simple 1,2 untill they catch on. If the 1,2 hits, then you should be
ready to do the 2,f+4 wich is by far his best ender for a CH 1,2.
Its damage is very high, and leaves an opponent cringing. I laugh
everytime someone lands this in NETSU because of how deadly it really
is. I can exert this enough, if your in doubt, and against a
standing opponent. USE THE 1,2!

The b+4,3 has entered this section, because it is your gap closer.
The last knee should never be used as an attacking device.. ever unless
in a long knee set up juggle. NOT 3 Knees! This however should be used,
when you fall victum to a sidestep.

The b+4,3 is extremely high priority and snuffs out a lot of pokes,
and does the damage to boot. If the first knee hits, the second is
guaranteed. But thats were it stops. If your opponent sidesteps the
first two knees, finish the string and you will sail safely into the
distance, hopefully out of retaliation range, to your most frustrated
opponent.

Use the b+4,3 on a backdashing character to get back into range,
or perhaps to land a free hit or two as normally they are very vulnerable.
The b+4 on its own can be utalised as a very good poke, it is completely
stationary with a good range, and a fast recovery. It leaves bruce were
he started the attack from.. Meaning this is mostly safe from retaliation,
combined with the fast recovery its almost completely safe. I dont actually
know any retaliation against it. The only real downfall is the lack of
damage that the b+4,3 would have done. ;) I have tried to do a few of
these in a row, but it seems that the b+4 doenst come out to fast after
some moves.. (The 3,3 for examle.. So much for a juggle) But yeah, its
worth the poke every now and again.

If your unsure of what you should do next, just whip out the 1,2,d+4_4
mixups, this can drive an opponent over the edge, bringing him to a
barage of hissy fits and piss ass tantrums because he cant get throu your
attack. You know you can use this combination of attacks well, when
you dont know yourself wich one you are going to pull out next. This is
also extremely good againts backdash turtles. You can destroy there
guard with this, and a few throws.

The 1,4,3 isnt REALLY a poke, but it comes in here anyway if you
"Purposly" wif it, so that the kicks will connect and be blocked,
leaving you mostly safe. However, this isnt really a poke, and should
be used more as a counter\interupt move.

The d+4_3 is definatly a quick poke that you can use to nudge that
little bit of extra damage out of your opponent moreso to piss them off.
You can do this 2 or even 3 times in a row, but no more, and not
more than once a day, even perhaps a week. Because you will be sooo
punished. Use this also to force out a crouched JIN that your afraid of.
People do the WS+2 expecting it will hit..
A tip.. It doesnt. ;)

----------------------------------------------

Interupting:

Bruces main task throughout the duel is to poke your opponent and to
interupt there attacks. This takes a lot of anticipation on Bruces part,
as well as your own. You must know that Bruces jab is VERY fast and
has high priority. Meaning you can chain and pummel but also do what this
section is on. Interupting.

This is pretty much guaranteeing yourself a CH with the hit. This is done
quite easily actually. When taging in, do the simple 1,2,1,2 combo, you
will be very suprised what this will catch and interupt, also
this can stun your opponent, leaving them startled for a moment for
you to run up and d/f+3 there ass.

I have countered a Hell Sweeping Kazuya, in his second spin with this
move.. and even tag divers.

The d+1 is a move you will interupt with often, as people will expect you
to have quite a long lag after a lot of your moves, and attack midlessly
if not relentlessly. Its priority out does many moves, and should be
used as somewhat of a shield. A "yoshi's flash" if you will.
You then can do whatever you please, might I suggest a ws+2, a slower
but juggling uppercut that only juggles on a CH. Many times, while you are
in crouch possition, people see this as vulnerable, if not potentially
stupid. This can be fixes with a quick WS+2 from the crouch, that should
interupt, followed by combo of your choice for the access damage.

The 1,4,3 is definatly a great move to follow many attacks with, I often
do this after a blocked 1,2,1 string, and deliberatly stop it there, and
do the 1,4,3. The 1,2,1 string leaves you with a -1 advantage, wich means
anyone with an 8 frame jab or higher, has exactly 1 frame less than you
to hit with, and if you do your jab first, you will often find that the
1,4,3 will hit on a nasty counter.

The 1,2,1,2 is moreso used on an incoming opponent that wants to rush
in with a nasty attack, nothing mishima style, short of the shining fists.
If they thing there coming in with it, then show them the power of a real
counter with the 1,2,1,2.

The 2,f+4 is not useless, it is used as an opening punisher, wich is why
I will put it into the "Punish" section and not here if your wondering.

However the 2,3_4_d+4 is by far a useful interupt move. It stuns your
opponent enough for the 3 to knock them over on a CH, and sends them
off there feet, leaving you for set ups, and a retaliating opponent with
slow wits will get hit by this a lot. A faster one you may have to
take it a step up, and do 1,2,3 instead. However, these are great for
people coming at you.

The 1,2,d+4_4_3 is the combo you will use to interupt very often,
knocking your opponent off there feet and pretty much destroying there
ego, and everything else with it. You can
hang back and win a match using nothing but this, but thats for the
"turtling" section. So use this when you want an interupt, but just
arent to sure of yourself.

----------------------------------------------

Bulldogging:

By putting constant pressure on your opponent, you can do one of two
things, win the match, or watch his head explode, and his temper tantrum
errupt into yells of "Cheap!" and "You Suck!"

But none the less, this is my favourite way to play bruce. This is all
to do with timing, you must link pokes in with a good defence, blocking
when you need to, then going back on the assault. Making sure your
opponent knows who has superiority when laying the smack down.

You can easily do this, by laying down my most over abused string,
the 1,2,1, 1,4,3 wich, if the 1,2,1 is blocked, you will nail
retaliation back into your opponents face. This is the basis of my
attack, wich I do NOT over use, or abuse. I mean abuse by it is what
I use to "Trick" damage out of the opponent.

Mix this up with a constant barage of attacks, SS+44's and all the
poke mix ups listed above.
Make sure you catch your opponent on a counter whenever he tries to
attack, because that is when the psycological games start at there
most deadly way.

Your opponent will go straight into turtle\interupt mode, were
is why you must learn when to block. I can not tell you this,
but there is no point in doing a 1,2, 1,4 3,3 string against a
mishima because it WILL be gone under and slamed with a CH on a
WGF and you will be totally screwed.

Pressure your opponent with a few d/f+1,2 and keep them standing
for your pokes. If you do this, then you should be safe with the
rest of the retaliation that may come with it.

Otherwise you can tack on a 1,4,3 onto a blocked one, and
depending how fast you\your opponent are, then you
will either get a CH or a really bad headache. ;)

----------------------------------------------

Turtling:

This is really underestimated with bruce, because you can get many CH from
waiting for an attack, and then slapping a CH on there forehead followed
by a big 2,3 2,f+4 juggle.

You can do things like the d/f+1,2 liberaly, hoping they may walk
straight into it. Dont look suprised, it does happen.

And also, you can do a backwards hopkick u/b+4 to get some distance and
range from you and your opponent. This looks stupid but it does come out
fast. And can deal a little damage as well, being very frustrating to
your opponent.

You have to wait out a lot of moves, prefering the retaliation of one
or more strong hits, doing little chunks of damage over huge CH combos.
This is done with the b+4,3 and the 2,f+4 combos, that do such good
free damage if they hit. It is always nice to land a CH on a stupid
mishima, but this is not always the case on a charging mishima bull
horned freak.

This is were the 3,2,1 is most useful. The 3 on the 3,2,1 has very
good range, and if you anticipate your opponent coming at you, it
can be used as somewhat of a "HAHA your going to fly", tool. A few of
these and some small juggles with a netsu will see your opponents life
bar of to the dumps. Heh, heh heh...

Anyway you want to land a lot of d+1 for the poke damage, and follow
it up with a totally safe WS+4. You should do this often, buffering
the chicken on reversal happy opponents, and even non reversal happy
ones just in case. It can deal damage too. ;)

----------------------------------------------

Punishing:

Ooooh, this is the Anti Scrub section, for those people who make too many
mistakes..

Finishing shining fists and the like.. Simply wham a good move into them..
good moves for this are

d/f+2
ss+4,4
TUMBLE WEED!!
d/f+3         Then stand there looking at them. ;) Hehehehehhe..
b+4,3
f+1,2         More of an insult really..
u/f+4         I prefer the d/f+2
any throw     Yeah yeah boring
3,3           If they hit a button thinking "Hahah fool did a small move" 
you can laugh
              as they go flying.
f,f+2         GOD I LOVE THAT FLIP OVER! You must yell.. "FREE TRIP!"
f,f+3         Not really a good idea, unless its REALLY bad wiff..
f,f,f+3       Better, but it will be blocked with a BIG stun to boot. ;)
2.f+4         FEEL THE PAIN!

In FC position

WS+4          YES! OH YES! Do this ALL THE TIME!
WS+2
d+1           Boring. =(
d/f,d,d/f+1   Hehe if this hits its STYLE!

So yeah, theres a good list, it shall surfice for now. ;) It will get
bugger later. ;)

12) Vs CHARACTER
================

This is were we tell you how to beat charicters..
However this is mostly a reference on what to expect, not an easy to use
guide to destruction. You must learn bruce and his talents first, then you
wont need this section at all.. But for now I will tell you what to expect
from some characters.

Alex/Roger:
----------

This will be a Greulling fight of throws and pokes. Stay close,
get ready to escape the throws. Use a lot of scare\keep away
tactics on him, and watch out for his deadly SS mixup game, its
insane to say the least.

His SS+4 can be punished by a lot of people, I mean it
gives mishimas a guaranteed WGF\EWGF so it cant be
all that good on its block stun. I assume the d/f+2 is much
the same, so punish him quite redily with whatever you can.
Be careful, if you see Roger crouch dash, then get ready for
the AGF. He can go right under a lot of your M\H strings
and slap you with a counter, make you loose a HUGE
portion of your life, and seriously damage your ego.

This is not something you can avoid esily if you go
out on an all out offencive.. If your up against one
of these, then stay back and turtle, bounce a bit, d,n,d,n
so you can trick your opponent into doing a low attack
and block it if your lucky.. but otherwise, be careful.

Thing is, this is proberbly going to be a GREULING
match, watch out also for the FC, f+2 that can juggle for
good if not devestating damage. Good luck against a master,
cause he\she is gonna poke you till you scream.

And dont underestimate roger, his power is undescribable.
The damage he can dish is damn near overwhelming. Keep
your limbs to yourself as much as you can, and go into short
linear pokes, a lot of 2,4_d+4 is definatly a good idea, because
roger will SS you can you will keep going on anything more
than on average two hits.

Angel/Devil:
___________

This guy is a JOKE. Watch out for the twin pistions. Stay low,
and keep an eye on the laser while tagging. His twin pistons
are seriously overused. It is not a threat if you are standing,
it is only a juggle if it lifts you up, and in that case, its
gonna put you into a juggle.

If its overabused then you can use the f,f+2 to counter the
sob that is laying into you. If your really fast, and you block
the first of the twin pistons, you can f,f+2 on the second half
and slap em with a good damage counter. IF YOUR REALLY
FAST!!

Do a lot of the 1,2,1 1,4,3 string to push devil out of range.
Dont initiate a long distance attack, because you will eat
the SS+2, istead, simply keep playing him with the 1,2
and the 2,4 to keep him away, and seriously irritae your
opponent. Devil\Angel have the hellsweep, but if you are
weary, then you can see this coming. When you block this
do a d/f+2 and lay the hurt down.

A general rule to keeping Mishimas off you is to do a 2,d+4
when they are crouchdashing at you. This stops momentum
and is also a general rule here too. ;)

If they wiff the devil twister, you can land any standard juggle
starter, and land whatever damage you feel nessesary.

In reality, if you face a master with this character, your best option is
to not let them initiate crouchdash, the WGF is special mid like
Heis, not high like Jins, lucky that Devil has no real juggles that
will do damage on his own, the main one is just WGF, 1, 1, WGF.
Be careful, and stay close. Devils most powerful ability is his
crouch dash.

NEVER use the Southern Cross unless you are sure it will hit.
There Twin Pistons is GUARANTEED on you if it is blocked.

Anna:
----

Stay low and away.
Plan your strings better, a simple 1,2,1 1,4 3 will chances are
be interupted by her insane poke speed. This is due to
her having the fastest d+1 in the whole game damn it. But
none the less, bruce has a longer d+1. Stay in Bruces range,
his kicks are long and pose as a good threat to anna.
However dont throw it out left right and centre. Simply
go into defencive mode. Because of the fact that anna has the
QCF+1 on CH that moves FAST then you pose a seriouse
problem, let me assure you. None the less, it can be ducked.
Duck it and do a WS+2 on her, for good damage, and perhaps
a juggle, always buffer a chicken because the reversal is so fast
after that.

You want to stay on top in this match up, the d+4,1 and d+3,2
are excellent pokes and counter moves, they can buffer in a SS
but most people use the qcf+1 to do most of her damage. This
is pretty much standard, so stay on your feet and SS a lot, it has
a little tracking and is a real pain in the ass a lot of the time.

Erm, poke when in range ONLY. This is important, really
important. This is perhaps bruces most dangerouse match up
because both characters are TOP TIER CH CHARACTERS.

And it gets to be a real pain in the A$$ but otherwise, watch
out for her u/f+1,3.. the f+1+2 is a true combo after it, and
you might even spend the whole match trading that combo
from her with your own 1,2, 2,f+4 that does BIG damage.

Watch out for 3 main string moves.
d+1, N+4
d+4, 1
d+3, 2

These are the moves that she makes strings out of. So be wareful
of these.

Armor King:
__________

This guy's WGF is anoying. A LOT of his moves hit high. He has no
mid throws, and the WGF is the only mean attack SPECIAL MID. Just
get in his face and stay low. The WGF is, IMHO the best WGF in the
game, its not as damaging as the EWGF or the 3EWGF, but it seems
longer ranged, and more chances to hit than the Mishimas. As for
juggles, you are looking at a small chunk of your life bar dissapering.
His WGF can be countered with your f,f+2 but its not likely to
happen, wich is why I wont advise it now.

Whenever he Crouchdashes, he is either going to do the Black Knee
or the WGF, knee is mid, wgf is special mid.

So a simple d+1 will stop anything that may come out.
The clothsline from hell f,n,d,d/f+1, is a very
fast move, but it hits high. Try to duck the clothsline if
you can, cause if you get hit by it, you will go flying backwards.
Also watch out for his Black Shoulder. That can be very damaging.
After the black shoulder, forget the throw, it is very apealing
to see A. Kings side to you, but a quick poke, and anything that
may have done damage is then thrown out the window.
For bruce this means a good 2,4 or 1,2,f+4 or something of the
like for most possible damage in the small window of opportunity
that there is.

Else, he can poke just like the rest. Watch out for his D+1, and his
D+1, N+2 cause they can be anoying.

He shouldnt get close to you, bruces range is better and stronger than
A.Kings, and if he gets close, you will have top push him back out again.
He uses the WGF to punish long range attacks, but if he gets predictable
use the f,f+2 to scare him into retreat. It normally works.. Then go
in for the kill, and watch out for the low dropkick.

Keep in mind the Hop Kicks and the Low Dropkicks. They come out
of no-were. The hopkick is fast, it has good range, and damaging
juggles to follow. As for the low dropkick, again, if you stay
low, this should not be a problem. Dont try to low parry it,
chances are you will land flat on your face with sore ankles.
Otherwise, its a poke match from hell.

Baek:
____

This guy is strings, LOTS and LOTS of strings. Watch out for his
WS strings, they come out fast, and dont stop. You dont want to
get juggled, because he can do some nice damage like that.
Just try to poke and block as much as you can. And inticipate
the next move.

This is bruces most agressive opponent, and you MUST interupt
him on his string changes, he reaches a point were he will be
able to be interupted by your 1 and that will hit on a CH for
such huge damage its not funny. You must anticipate.

An advanced BAEK can wavedash, this is perhaps his highest
priority to get close, to land his dangerouse strings. If
you get hit by the last hit of his ws, 3, 3, 4 his u/f+3+4
is a guaranteed hit, so be wary of that string. Baek has
a few low hitting moves, but during some point he must go
to a high hitting move. A lot of the time the transition between
these moves are when you want to interupt them with the 1,21,2
combo. This deals HUGE damage and will proberbly force your
opponent to shorten his strings.

REMEMBER: If the next move has the option of being Low, or a
mid hitting juggle starter, better to block mid. Unless you
know that the next move is low. Because, you would proberbly
be better off taking a low hit, than getting juggled for a
lot of mean damage.

Eddy:
----

Pass, seriously I have never played a good eddy before.

Ganryu:
------

This guy AINT no joke nor jack. This guy can pull off some of the
most DAMAGING juggles I have EVER seen. Stay up, and watch for an
oppening, he is NOT slow, so you have to be clever. Poke when you
can, and watch out for his punch parry. If you are caught by it,
you cant chicken it, you will take throw damage, and you are left
with you back turned, and he can pull of anything from a side kick,
to a Head Rush F+1+2. Chances are, he is going to sit down infront
of you. There are two options here for old Ganny. He has a Megaton
Palm, that hits mid for NASTY damage, and also a arm sweep, that
he can turn into small juggles. If he does the spits, then he can
roll sideways, but this isnt too much of a threat. If he sits down
infront of you, you should do a d+1 straight away. You should not
let him get back up. If he does, its a guessing game, and that is
not what you want. Also, he will try to get you with his Sumo Push
d+1+2, if this hits, you will stagger backwards, and if it is blocked,
he is left with initiative. Although I dont recomend trying to stop
this move with a poke, you can try it if you feel nessesary to stop
it. Also, keep in mind, that he has a slow, but damaging sweep. It
is hard to sidestep, and has no sweep stun when blocked either. So
all in all, ganny here is a good character to use.

This is were your 1,4,3 comes in most useful. On a CH its guaranteed,
but also if it hits, I think it may be a guaranteed combo also.. anyway
this is the combo you must use when Ganny misses or wiffs a move.
He is a very 1 hit person, so your not going to get many opportunitys
for the interupt. If your up against a turtle, then the Sniper Kick f,f,f+3
is a good entry mid hitting move that has big block stun, and gives you
initiative to come back in and murder your opponent quite happily.

Haplesly take heed my words when I say dont get hit, and let him get
on the offencive. Because he is dangerouse. Use your f,f+2 a lot,
gannys kicks suck, and the f,f+2 will interupt a lot, or give good
block stun, good range etc.. this is your main move next to the
southern cross 1,4,3 combo. Here also, is were you must use
the 1,2,1, 1,4,3 combo often, because it cant be interupted, unless
ganny does a reversal on the 1,4,3. Otherwise if blocked its safe.
Lastly If you get hit by the last bit of his WS+1+2, 1+2 the throw
for him is GUARANTEED so be ready to break it.

Heihachi:
________

A good heihachi player will have you on your toes all the time.
Dont go head to head with his crouch dashes. Chances are you'll
loose. Get the throws off, and roll whenever you are grounded
and think the stomps comming. Techrolling is a good idea sometimes
just to get away from a stomp happy opponent. But if your opponent
mixes up with hellsweeps.. Then you have a problem. Stay down,
and take the first hellsweep. Its better than taking the whole
two hellsweeps into an TGF. (I say 2, because most people know,
that the 3rd hellsweep will chances are, not connect.)
Again if you are fast, then the d+4 or the 2,d+4 is a good Crouch
Dash killer, IF your timing is good, else you will die.

Watch out for his kicks, things like the standing CH 4 can be
leathal and damaging to say the least. Dont get him on a counter
with your CH 4 because, it will do an automatic counter. He still
takes damage, which is funny to watch as an ending move I might
add.

His WGF hits special mid now, so don't be afraid to block it from
any height. If you a crouched, it will send you back a bit, and
you should be able to recover before he does anything too painful
to you. Just keep in mind a few things about his Crouch Dashes.

1. After a hell sweep, if there is a pause, the TGF is coming.
2. The second hellsweep is always blockable accept on counter.
3. The TGF has no Mid\Low kick after it.
4. The WGF is SPECIAL MID. NOT mid.

Heihachi has no d+1 poke, it is a tile splitter, BUT a good
Heihachi player will know that he has a d/b+1 poke. That is
just as good as the d+1 poke of other characters. He is BEST
played out crouch dash distance. Dont let him get into this
position. Chances are he will shadow step out of hellsweeps,
and stand back. His CD game is very good, so you want to poke
ALL his CD's. Make sure you dont let him get to CD distance.
Stay in his face and poke like mad. Dont let him do anything.

The Twin Pistons d/f+1,2 is a good juggle starter, be careful
of this. You should SS+4 whenever you feel a mid\high move
comming out. He wont stop in the middle of a Crouch Dash.
Or if he is wave stepping, again, a SS+4 should stop him.
Again, he plays much like ganryu, you must set up your own
CH interupts, things like the 1,2,1 1,4,3 cant be interupted at
all here, so a good time killer, and life killer for the stupid
as well. The f+4,3 can be a good poke here, because of the
fact that Hei likes CD range. Suprise.. and the f+4,3 is two
good ranged kicks. Use them often if hei is on defencive and
it can give you the initiative you need to get in there.

Hwaorang:
________

Toe to Toe. Interupt EVERYTHING with your 1,4,3 1,2,2,f+4
and your 1,2,1,2. This is heaven. Learn when his strings can
be interupted. And dont let him BREATH. Bruce can damn
near rip this guy appart. If your not certain, do a b+1 for
huge damage, and make him pay a price of strings. This
is the character IMHO bruce was MADE to beat.

Instead of ducking high parts of strings, do the b+1 because
it will stun, and you can land whatever after that, wich is nice.
D+1 is INVALUABLE here, if he is a distance fighter, that
likes to use his kicks, maul him with whatever you have.

Crazy Legs: This is a Class of its own. This is a very dangerouse
way to play old BOB here. I have no tacticts VS this, just stay low
and POKE like mad. Dont do any lag moves, and try not to get confused
by the amounts of moves that soon follow. Crazy Legs depend on the
player, but is very pattenised. Just watch for a pattern, and look
for oppenings to destroy your opponent.

Jack 2:
______

Raw Power. Watch out for his uppercuts, and SS moves, they can do
the damage. And he is faster than people estimate, so take care.
He has mostly the same moves as Mr M G Jack, with lack of a few
and gain of some others. Watch out for his Ram, it seems to go
down well with scrubs and masters alike, and also his SS arsenal.
The SS arsenal is mostly high, that doesnt mean stay low, cause
you will eat a double knuckle in the head and that would hurt.
No no, just SS and poke. Get in his face, and wait for a botch
up of Wiff. Then nail him. On Paper, should be easy. IRL, not
so much.

Jun:
___

Jun is VERY string based, and a lot of moves can be ducked. She is
an easy kill all in all.

Sadly shes not really interupt material for Bruce, but it can be done.
She may be slow, but she is a very good character to play. And is
by far as good as Nina atleast. She can dish out the damage, and her
strings are hard to interupt. You can trade string for string, chances
are you will win. Her stamina isnt very good, but damn can she
dish the damage out if you get hit. Her juggles are weak.. so yeah.

Get in there and do what you can to CH!

Also, sidestep whenever she wiffs a move, and punish her. Watch out for
the Can Can kicks d+3+4 thou, those things are leathal to their name.
They are not like jins can can kicks, she must have been having a
period when teching him those, cause something went VERY wrong.
But anyway, the most favourite string to scrubs is the Punch Punch
Sweep X3 and from start again. It is easy to low parry the sweep.
Watch out for the No Hand Cartweel Thingee thou.. (The thing were she
flips sideways and hits with both her legs, you know the one, I forgot
the name) And poke her out of her long boring strings, and teach them that
Punishment is your best trait.

Else all in all its nice and easy.

Now, a master. Stay out of his reach. Once he juggles you,
do whatever nessesary to get up. DONT STAY DOWN. Cause
once you are, you have a problem. Jun is VERY good at dishing out
damage to air and ground opponents, and more so when it comes to
juggling them. If you get in close, expect strings. Low parry when
the sweeps come along, they almost always do, and interupt whatever
comes out high. Again the Can Can Kicks are a favourite in this
recipie for destruction. Keep that in mind. This is going to be
a greuling matchup of skill and poking, good luck.

King:
____

Scrubs? Learn the breaks and beat them up. EASY.
Masters?? Get in close and poke. This is going to be a war,
and watch out for the multi's, default to {1} for your break
after you miss the first {2} break. Chances are, if there not
good, they will do the Giant Swing. Else watch their hands,
and if they do the Mussle Buster, default to {2} again.

All kings multis have {1} as a break in them.. Just learn that and
you should be fine against throwers.

Now, a master will utalise his pokes, and his strategical
moves. He has a fast hopkick, that leads into small damage
juggles, that can put a world of pain on if you get thrown
on the ground. The most prefered ground throw is the Head Bomber.

The break for it is {2} so if you are ground thrown, do this.
Poking kings are more anoying, they tend to use a lot of standing
pokes, more so, you should realy be standing against king, if he
crouchdashes, poke with a d+1. Watch out, king has the d+1, N+2
It is still devistating. His new poke, is the d/f+1,2 that does an
elbow sting, into a gutpuch. This is stoped by poking him yourself.

Ok, now, king likes to throw. Most of his damage come from throws.
The most used command throw is the Muscle Buster. A break of 1+2.
Then again, the other one is the giant swing. Which has a break of {1}
So an idea is to push 1, hold, and press 2 for a break. This should
break any throw that has a break of 1 or 1+2. Watch for the mid throw
moves that can leave you in a position that you can be ground thrown.
This is one time I must say, Poke like crazy, and GO head to head
with his crouch dashes. If he crouchdashes, do the same you might
land a TUMBLE WEEEEEEEED!!! Hehehe, cause bruce is slower. He might
do the double knuckle out of the crouchdash, then you have a problem. You
Will want to use pokes instead in that case. ;)

Dont go head to head with king throwing, being a King master
Thats just stupid. Show him you have just as long pokes as him
and damage the BEJESUS out of him with them, and the GUARANTEED
CH that comes with the damn thing. ;)

Kuma\Panda:
__________

Dont get hit by the fart. Easy as that. Nah, Kuma is a force to be
reconed with. The new Bear Stance is very nasty, and can keep away
a bulldoging opponent really well, just be careful, he has a few
options from here, namely a bear fling, that hits mid, and also
a bear swipe, that is like a fast poke. If this hits, the harder
right hand swipe is unstopable, and quite damaging, however, this
will take him out of the stance. Also, when he is in this stance,
he can not block at all. This is handy, cause you can 2,4 or whatever
else you feel may be nessesary to do good damage and keep him
out of it. You can generaly get interupts, you will however have to
use your own timings etc depending on the opponent, and it may
be easier to set up interupts. Watch out on the 1,2,1 1,4,3 I dont
*THINK* the f+1,1,1 can interupt, but I am the only AVID Kuma
user bar Abrar around here so I am not sure, have to check it out.
Poke anything else he does, watch out for his deamon paw uppercut.

I think everyone would agree that this IS his best juggle starter.
It can launch you up, for a quick tag or good damaging juggles.
So watch out. The circus roll is tagable, so if you get cought
by this, you can expect to be hit by the partner soon after.
His fastest poke is the f+1, which combos into a G-Clef Cannon.
The Cannon does good dammage, juggles and is taggable, so watch
out. Else, his d+1 has an uncanny range, and is fast, so it will
stop pretty much anything you try and do if your not careful.
His f+1+2 hits high now, and is pretty much faster than T3 so
watch out. Do a lot of SS and WS moves. And really poke him to
submission. Break the Circus Roll whenever you can, and if
you dont, be ready for damage. Else, just be careful..

Kunimitsu:
_________

Watchout for the d/f+2 cause that's gonna hurt. Else you should
be pretty ok. Just keep an eye out for her tricky tactics.
She has the d+1+2 were she disapears into the floor for a bit,
and raises back up. The other disapearing act she does, she comes
out of the roof with unblockables. This is not actually that
dangerouse, a standing 4 kick will stop her from hitting you
most of the time, the hit, though unblockable, follows a very
narrow path straight down. So anything to be hit by it, must be
directly under it. The other real damaging things are her
Poison Wind d+3+4, which is easy to avoid, and her SS+3+4.
Which is like rogers SS+4 but not as cool. I have never faced
a good Kuni before, so do not know much. I think its a lot like
yoshi?

You can lay the smack down whenever she wiffs anything, so
you should do it when you can, else yeah.. ANYONE?

Law:
____

This is pretty much GREULING. Don't let him juggle you, you will
be in a world of pain.. Just stay out, and try not to get caught
on a CH with the 1-Inch. Else, the Dragon Slide, and the Dragon
Tail are his main low moves. Wait for a nice high flip and smack
him with a 2,f+4 or 2,d+4

Poking will beat him out of anything big he migh try to do.
Watch out for his WS position, he has a BIG uppercut that can lead to a
WORLD of pain on a good tag juggle. His Junkyard Combo (B+2,3,4)
is a favourite with scrubs. They try to mix it up with his other
Dragon Punch Combo (Is that what its called?? B+1,2,1) Don't even let
him start it. As soon as you see the first punch, kill them with your own
combo of 1,2,1,2 or 1,4,3 and sow them the error of there way. Easy fix.
Else, if you know its the Junkyard, lowparry the 3. And do a hopkick for
a nice little juggle.  The other problem you may face is he has a fast,
and I mean FAST flip from the d+2 punch. This may be a problem
for any rush moves, as the d+2 will stop you, and the flip will
send you right up for some mean damage. Otherwise, he has a parry

(Just found that out. =) ) And a wierd dance punch parry. While hes
dancing hes fodder for the f,f,N+1. Otherwise, you should be able
to poke like mad. And stop almost everything else. Just low parry
the second hit of the junkyard combo. PLEASE!

Lei:
____

Kookie is the right word for this guy. A lot of people do the razor
rush into a stance (f,n+1,2,1,2,4) Just remember if Lei does the
last kick, he goes into a Crane stance were he CAN NOT block. There
are also high or low hits from the crane stance. Get in and punish with the
1,2,1,2 or 1,4,3. That will stop most lei's in their tracks. If you are
against a HAHAHA lei, then you have a problem. Try to pull off as
much damage as you can. And make Lei come to you. Tag Slide, do this
when you can..

Wait till he does the HAHAHA and slide him. Chances are he will do a
MID punch to stop you and will go off his feet. Otherwise, just look
out for the RAVE SPIN, (d/b+4,4) If he does this and you block, stay
low and do an Get in and Use the opportunity to get in close, and
punish with your own moves.

If Lei lies down FU/FA Do the d/f+3 ONLY. Dont get near him
cause he could Rave Spin or Kangaroo Kick, just beat him up.
If he is lying FD/FA watch out for the slide.

All his moves are pretty much low, so go in carefully, stay low, and
get ready to block the slide attempt. The other thing, while I remember,
is dont attack a backturned one. It is bad for your health.
The other thing I have learned, is people tend to prefer certain moves
from certain stances, if you watch carefully, you may be able to
anticipate anything that may be coming.

Also, when he goes into an Animal stance from the Razor Rush, do a d+1
to get him out of it straight away. That is your best option every time,
and stand, and get into his face again. Do a lot of mid hits, to keep him
standing and some low ones for good poke damage. Use the 3,2,1 often also,
as a good ranged keep away get close safely move.

Ling:
____

What to say, ling will stay low, REAL low, get in on her. She's fast,
so watch out for her WS+2 that can lead to a MEAN juggle. Her juggles
are FINATICAL so dont let her get you up. A lot of her moves are low.
Do a lot of b+4,3 to get in close, and make sure she doesnt duck. After
that do a 2,4 to teach her not to duck, you can almost guarantee she will.
You can interupt a lot, but use the d+4 HEAPS when she is low in anything.
It is quick and leaves you safe. Dont do 2,4 when shes in Phoenix Stance
cause you will wiff and get hurt.

All in all this is a nasty battle. And should not be taken lightly.
If its a scrub thou, pulling out those dumb Phoenix Stance, roll around
throws, just duck and punish till they die. Oh, and remember the most
USEFUL move against ling. USE the D+1 WHENEVER you need it. Its going
to be a NASTY poking game. The thing with ling, is a master will be all
over the place, dont try to throw a backturned ling, you are gonna get
hurt somink KRONIK.

Instead do a b+4,3 b+4,3,4.. Believe me it will show her whos boss. ;)

Machine Gun Jack:
________________

What to say, he is NOTHING like Ganryu, just poke him till he goes
BALISTIC. Thats it. SS+4,4 heaps. and all inall you should be able to
beat him EASY. SHOULD is the key word. On paper this is all good,
IRL against a master, its a different matter. Watch out for throws,
and make sure you dont stay too low. A few of Mr. M G Jacks moves are
power low, but they are slow. PARRY THEM whenever you get the chance,
and remember his guns ARE blockable. He has, as I have discovered,
a very fast d/f+2 uppercut, with good distance, mid hitting, and doing
decent juggles can make you loose a good portion of your life.
Else a lot of his moves are pure, raw, unadaulterated power, and are
not very hard to stop.

Also, watch out for the Dark Greeting PLEASE!! This move is EASY to
stop, and so many people get hit.  This is OPPORTUNITY CENTRAL
to rip him APPART with 1,2 2,f+4!! One more thing. Dont anticipate
what he is going to do next from the Scissors. Its either a low
Scissors or a good Megaton Punch. All in all, you can do a d+1
before the second move comes out. Then go into a poking frenzy,
from string to string, don't let him do anything. He is very slow
in the long run, and relys greatly on his power play. So just poke
untill your opponent tags, and realises his Gun Jack is neautralised.
Then again, if you fight a scrub, laugh.
A master.. Good Luck.

Mokujin/Tetsujin:
_________________
See all Chars. Just learn the stances so you know who he is!!

Ogre:
____

Keep out of his kicks, and watch out for his F+2 and his
f,f+2. The hand snap thingee can be sidesteped after the first block,
but that doesnt leave you with much initiative, if none at all.
However if you are good, you can b,b dash instead, wich will leave him
open to ANYTHING even the b+2+3 sidewider is a good oprion here,
you can literally rip Ogre Appart in here. ;)

Forget the Infinate Kicks, no one in there right mind will do them.
Or a smart person will do the first few hits, which I might add does
DAMN nasty damage.. And then stop. If they like to continue them thou,
a simple SS+4,4 will stop them very quickly. A good idea is to watch
out for his legs. They are very long, and can be very damaging if
your not careful. But any ogre will try to initiate his crouch game,
the range of moves from this position is too good to give up. Also,
when you are down, watch out for his double fist cannon ball thing
that he does. It hits grounded opponents for more damage than I would
apreciate taking, and that, other than his SS+4 wich is a type of sweep,
is about the only ground hitting moves he has, but dont think that is
not enough, because it is.

You can be a pain in the ass with a lot of b+4,3's to keep him standing,
and get in close, this will stop the stupid Crouch games he plays. ;)
If you get in close, throw him and get back out again. Its as easy as
that. A master will do a lot more of his kicks thou, and you will
have to go toe to toe in hopes that your jabs are faster.. and you can
catch an interupt here and there. ;)

Paul:
_____

This guy is the Deathfist masher of the millenium. Most likely,
you will face nothing but 10-Stringers or Deathfist Junkies.
All you have to do is poke. If by chance, you do face an opponent
that manages to use paul more than with Deathfist alone, then you
will have to watch out for his Elbow QCF+1, into juggle with deathfist
ender. The Falling Hammer combo's, like the deathfist\falling leaf
combination, just do a d+1 to stop whatever comes out. Its always
useful against what ever he is doing, Paul is boring, and I am not
going to say much more about it. I mean, simple pokes and SS+4,4
should surfice.

P.Jack:
______

This guy is wierd. Get out of his way, and watch out for his SS. Dont
wiff and you cant loose. Well thats an understatement. Hehe..
Dont get hit by the F+1+2 or you will hurt. And dont get juggled either
cause Jin gonna come in and lay the smack down on you.. Else POKE and
Throw. Nice and easy. Never faced a master before, and I bet you wont
either...

But chances are if you do face one, you will proberbly be in pain.
I have never faced one, so go for your life.

True Ogre:
_________

This is a POKE war. POKE EVERYTHING you can. Your D+1 can beat ANYTHING
he tries to do AT ALL. And that is all you really need. Just POKE like
Crazy!! And you should be fine for a while. Make sure you dont let him
get any moves off, and if he does, SS or Duck or whatever. JUST MAKE HIM
WIFF!! And you should be sweet as for the damage. If you really feel like
going head to head try a lot of throws. T Also, watch out for his crouch
games, and his Headbutt juggle starter. Otherwise, as Reverend C said
in his "Anna FAQ the D+1 should stop anything he does."

Use every string that you have, and go insane with the mix ups, there is no
point in leaving any openings, T. Ogre is SLOW as hell and should be dead.
I hate his guts. (From a T. Ogre player, strange eh? ;) ) But yeah,
MURDER KILL do LOTS of mid hits, the gutpunch is mean, hold F to get out
of it, and if your on the offencive it shouldnt be hard to escape. ;)

Yoshimitsu:
__________

Watch out for the d/f+2. Fastest uppercut in the game. And the juggles
with damage are VERY good. Just dont get caught. SS a lot, and hopkick.
This is really all you can do. A good Yoshi will have you lost in strings.
A bad one will do nothing but his Crap 10-String, which I might add can
be poked at 6 different points in time. Just dont let his dancing around
intimidate you. Get into him, and throw him around a bit. He has one
command throw, so learn to break it. And watch out for unblockables.

The unblockables have good tracking, so dont try to SS and get in close,
chances are your gonna get stabed. At that wouldnt help at all..
Also, watch out for the Roo kick, that can lead to BIG juggles. If you
get caught by it thou, you must have been sleeping. Cause its SLOW..
Keep in mind that he has the sword slash for Okizeme, that can be
rolled sideways out of.

==============================================================================
13) CONCLUSION
==========================

Bruce is an insane Bulldogging character, hes great for that reason mostly,
and takes a lot of anticipation. Play him for fun more than to win, please?
I see people doing nothing but d/f+2, 3,2,1 ss+4,4's and all that, and I
get so bored when all they EVER do is 3Knees, or if they think they are
good, d/f+1, b+4,3,4 I mean, YEACH! I give up my credit to these people,
I get so bored I cant be bothered. Really I cant.. its so boring its not
funny.

Team up Bruce with almost anyone, but experiment, and dont do juggles at
all sometimes, understand that that is not Bruces strong point. It is
primarily his CH counter combos, wich he has NUMEROUSE of, so you
cant complain he doesnt have enough of them..

Please Email me for strats on either of the Kick Boxers, and I will be
happy to converse with ya, else,

Happy Ass Kicking. ;)

BTW, Merry Xmas to you all, and a Happy New Year. ;)
