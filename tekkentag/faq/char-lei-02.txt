==============\
WHY LEI.....?  \
================\

In the iron fist tournament Lei is totally Unique.(Why..? because you cannot 
find any clone for him.)  Ya that's right,  he doesn't  have any clones like 
Mishimas,  Kings,  Anna/Nina etc. He  is a  player who is fast and powerful. 
With Lei you get many okizeme  chances and  makes other  players guess.  Ya! 
with Lei mind games are numerous (we will discuss later). Moreover he can do 
insane damage  with simple  hits. These all stuff Make him the most powerful 
characters ever. So now we will go in detail.....

==============\
LEI's STRENGTH \
================\

      - Confusing fighting styles
      - Numerous grounded/back turned attacks
      - Powerful kicks
      - Very good low attacks
      - High Juggle capabilities
      - Can recover life	
      - Low attack counter(hold F while in Panther Stance)
      - Lei has useful throws


==============\
LEI's Weakness \
================\
	
	Many moves set opponent up for an attack from behind, 
	Which is very bad for any character in Tekken.

=============\
MOVE ANALYSIS \
===============\

In this section we will discuss about the moves of LEI. Lei has got more
moves than any other character in the Iron Fist Tournament, and so it is
difficult to judge his moves. But any way we will do that here.

The moves which I think are good
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) b+1+2					Rating ******* 
	This move is one of his best. Very fast and does good damage. 
	This move has lot of advantageous, while doing this move high
	hits and some medium hit's are avoided by Lei which his 
	opponents exceute on him. (for eg. King's b+4, Mishimas 112 etc.)
	So I recomment you to use this move.

2) d+3+4					Rating ********
	The Play dead position. It is good for keeping your opponent 
	guessing. While in play dead position you have many choices
	3~4 which hits low and then high or 3+4 which hits high. These
	may lead you to juggle oppertunities (check the juggles section).

3) f,n+1,2,1,2,3_4				Rating **********
	Lei also have a move called Razor Rush (just like the 112 move of
	Mishimas). This is also good, do the move even if your opponent
	blocks, f,n+1,2,1,2 after inputting those commands input 3 or 4.
	If you input 3 Lei will hit his opponent low, and if it's 4 he will
	kick high.

4) 4~3						Rating *******
	This move is called the Cleean Sweep. After exceuting this move 
	you will be in resting position. This move is faster if done
	in RES.

5) 4~4,3~3					Rating ******
	Oh man! my Favotite move. In tag tournament, when the opponent tags
	out do this move, Never mind if the 4~4 doesn't hit, but 3~3 should 
	hit. This makes your opponent fly damn high, immediately tag. If you
	have a good patner with you, you can do life sucking juggles.

6) u/f_u/b+2					Rating *****
	Falling Leaf, Cool move, it's effective aganist grounded opponents.
	This move give you a play dead position, which can lead to lei's
	most powerful juggles. (discussed in juggles section). This attack is 
	guarantied after the spin and grab throw (DRG 1).


7) f, f+1+2					Rating *********
	This is a very useful throw, it can increase the range. This throw
	requires a two button escape which makes it more dealdy.


Well I think these are enough for now. 6 new moves will be added in every
update.

=================\
A PEEK ON STANCES \
===================\
      
Phoenix
        This style has very limited uses: it is very easy to knock Lei 
	out of any of the attacks he may use while in this stance.
Drunken
        This style has a powerful punch and can be used as a high or 
	mid-level punch counter(Lei automatically sidesteps any punches). 
	However, other than those functions, this stance is very limited in 
	it's usefulness.
Dragon
        This stance has powerful moves, but they all connect at high or 
	mid-level and are therefore easy to block with the single exception of 
	the Neckshaker throw, but that move is fairly easy to see coming and 
	can be ducked or broken.
Crane
        The best moves in this stance would be the two punches. If you 
	press rp, and your opponent fails to block it, you are set up in the 
	back turned position. If you press lp, and your opponent does block it, 
	you are again set up in the back turned position. In other words, as 
	long as you are reasonably sure about whether or not your opponent will 
	block the next attack, you can punish him for being too predictable.
Tiger
        This stance only has a few attacks, but they are fast and they 
	hit at different levels, and so they are difficult to block.
Snake
        Another stance that has very fast moves. The Three Punch 
	Combo(rp,rp,rp) will stun an opponent even if they block the first two 
	punches, allowing the third punch to connect. You can also switch into 
	other stances by holding F after any of these punches. If the first 
	punch connects on counterhit, it will stun your opponent, allowing you 
	to set up other attacks.
Panther
        An excellent stance. It has fast moves that connect at 
	different levels, and rp juggles. Even if the rp is blocked, you can 
	follow it with the Guard Melting Punches(...,lp,rp). Try using the 
	Two-handed Low Punch(lp) a few times, and then follow that with the rp 
	if you think your opponent will try to block the TLP.

The Five Stances may be entered "directly" from the normal ready
stance via the the Ryuusei-Mid.Kick attack.  (f,N,1,2,1,2,4)  By
stopping the button presses mid-way and moving the joystick up or
down, they may be accessed as follows:


         __(f,N,1,u_d)   Snake
        /   __(f,N,1,2,1,u_d)  Panther       strike|stance
       /   /                                   1st | Snake
  f,N,1,2,1,2,4 --(f,N,1,2,1,2,4,u_d)  Crane   2nd | Dragon
         \   \__                               3rd | Panther
          \     (f,N,1,2,1,2,u_d)  Tiger       4th | Tiger
           \__                                 5th | Crane
              (f,N,1,2,u_d)  Dragon
 

==================\
THE GUESSING GAMES \
====================\

This is the most exciting part of the battle. Lei's victory lies in his
guessing games. He is the only character which keeps his opponents guess.
Here i will teach you how to keep your opponents under pressure.

WHEN IT SAYS ROUND 1 FIGHT.........
	Immediately go into the play dead position. If your opponent is
an average tekken player he will duck (thinking that you will mash 3~4), 
and here is your victory, what you are going to do is mash 3+4, it will
toss him high. This can lead to deadly Lei juggles (see Juggle section).
This is one type of guessing game.
	The next guessing game stars in the back turned position. After
the back turned position d+1 is a good juggle starter. During the back 
turned position u/f+4 is another good juggle starter, when lookig through
this ankle most of his hits are a kind of juggle starter.
	
=======\
OKIZEME \
=========\

What is Okizeme....?
	Well it means "Attack the opponent while ground" or when they get
up from ground. Like King, Lei also numerous okizeme attacks. It keeps
your opponent under pressure. It is something which you should learn...
these technique if done correctly & wisely can lead your success.....
To be frank..... I lack this technique to an extent. Even then I will try
to describe it......

Moves to put your opponent under pressure (OKIZEME ATTACKS)

d/b+4 : 
	Quite safe and quick. It also has moderate range, but inflicts less 
	damage. You can proceed in your animal stances, which is good.

If you see your opponent rolling use the 4~4,3~3 attack. This takes a whole
lot of life from your opponent.

=====================\
GUYS TO WATCH OUT FOR \
=======================\

Here I will discuss how to use Lei with other characters like King, Paul
Nina, etc.. not in detail but as short tips.....

HOW TO FACE KING....?
	
	Well King is a powerful character. King has got powerful jabs and
poking moves which you should take care. When your opponent is King never
do the 3,3 move, this will leave you back turned which give king free 
attacks. You can use this move aganist beginners but don't use it aganist
intermediates and experts. King's b+4 can be easily avoided by Lei with
his b+1+2 move. King get's lots of damage when this is done. When ever
King uses high hits use this move to escape or to kill (just a phrase pal!)
your opponent. When it comes to king, his catches are deadly, so watch out 
for it. As discussed above use the f,n1,2,1,2,3_4 most as this keeps your
opponent in a confused state.
	Ground plays does not work with King a lot... (I mean with a good
King player) so you would rather stay on your feet than play dead). Keep 
this in mind every time you play with King.....

Well more on next update........

LEI's PARRY     \
=================\

Lei doesn't have reversals like Paul, Nina etc. But he has parry. Parry
means when your opponent hits you low, if you suddenly input (d_d/b)+(1+3_2+4)
this command Lei will push his opponent away, this causes a particular
ype of stun. Lot's of people know how to parry but doesn't know what to do
after it. In this section we will discuss about it....

After a low parry>>> STARTER: u/f+4

  u/f+4, f,N+1, f,N+4,1, 4~4 
  u/f+4, d/f+1, f,N+1, f,N+4,(1),2,3 
  u/f+4, d/f+1, f,N+1, 2, d/b+4 
  u/f+4, d/f+1, 2, 1+2,2 
  u/f+4, 4~4,3~3
  u/f+4, any juggles from the juggle section.

A normal reversal can cause only 30 damage, but a parry can lead to deadly
juggles, so let your imaginations go wild.

================\
LEI'S HA HA STEP \
==================\

	One of the Lei's most beautiful escape move. It is done my mashing 
b+3+4~b repeatedly. If this is done correctly he will retreat back in an 
orderly manner which can even lead to your victory. This victory move is 
called the 18th step in Indian Martial arts (ya simpley called the run away 
move).This HA HA step can be also done by inputting b+3~4~b repeatedly. 
To masterthis move completly it takes time. But any way PRACTICE MAKES 
PERFECT. 
	This move is useful in tight matches. If you think that you cannot
defeat your opponent, try to reduce his life bar and do this move repeatedly.
When your opponent comes near you cancel this move into a Razor Rush, even
if your opponent block it, this move him give him a stun giving you enough
time to do your HA HA Step again. And if you master this you can even
become the world Tekken champion like Seok. 

================\
LEI'S HE HE STEP \
==================\

HE HE Step is done by repeating b,b,4~3+b, this is also a cool move. 
If done correctly Lei stand still and glicth rotate in an orderly manner.
Property: Just cool to see. Use this if you want fun in matches.
