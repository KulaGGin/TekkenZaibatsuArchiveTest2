THE PURPOSE:

The purpose of this Faq is to provide an help using Armor King in Vs battles: therefore
I will not include methods of combat against CPU opponents as, and you'll have certainly
noticed, CPU is not a hard opponent (even if Unknown can cause problems sometimes) and
you don't need particular tactics to beat it as it uses the same fighting style over and
over.
Use the CPU to train yourself, try and discover juggles, learn tricks and understand arts'
properties. Ok, let's start!!!

A BRIEF ARMOR KING PROFILE:

Armor King is back in TTT and he's quite changed. Now he's a more complete character with
some multipart throws and an interesting juggle possibility. He's a well balanced fighter
that has a lot of advantages (in fact you can use the Crouch Dash to confuse your opponent,
have a good okizeme possibility, count on a mid/high move power, damaging juggles, quick
punch strings to set up throws), and weaknesses that IMO are not so serious (Armor King
lacks about power shots as he cannot count on monsters like Paul's Phoenix Smasher, he
hasn't the great variety of multiparts that King the 2nd has).
I use him a lot because I like his fighting style, having the possibility to pressure the
opponent without too much trouble to suffer retaliation, count on a quite varied gameplay
and, maybe it's strange to say, I like his armor (even if the one he wore in Tekken 2 was
better), the mask and the red glowing eye on it.

BASICS:

+ Conventions + 

1 = left punch;
2 = right punch;
3 = left kick;
4 = right kick;
5 = tag in / out;
1+2+3+4 = Ki powerup. You inflict 1.5 times more damage during the powerup, guard damage
if the opponent blocks and your first hit will be a Counter Hit, but you can't use block;
f = tap forward;
F = hold forward;
b = tap backward;
B = hold backward;
N = leave the joystick neutral;
~ = press immediately after previous command or button;
_ = you can choose how to perform the move using the command shown right before the symbol
or the command that's after it;
! = unblockable
WS = while standing;
WR = while running;
BK = when backturned;
cc = crouch cancel;
SS = Sidestep;
df = down+forward;
DF = hold down+forward;
db = down+back;
DB = hold down+back;
u/d = sidestep right / left of your opponent;
U = hop;
Uf = hop forward;
Ub = hop backward;
f, f = dash forward;
b, b = dash backward;
f, f, f = run;
HCF = half circle forward;
QCF = quarter circle forward;
Crouch Dash = f,N,d,df;
Okizeme = attack a grounded opponent with techniques like Corporate Elbow, Stagger Kicks,
Double Shin Kick to score one more hit and prevent him from getting up;
H  = high attack. Block it with standing guard;
M  = mid attack. Block it with standing guard;
L  = low attack. Block it with crouch guard;
SM = special mid attack. You can block it either with standing or crouching guard.

+ Get up from ground, sidestep, parry +

If you have played enough time to TTT you'll have certainly noticed that the game offers a
lot of basic techniques that an average player must know and understand.
It's important for example to know how and when get up from ground, how to use the sidestep,
how and when, but IMO it's not fundamental, to parry.
Speaking about "while-on-the-ground techniques":
- you can perform a rising mid kick hitting 4, or a rising low kick using 3;
- you can make a tech roll by hitting a button as soon as you hit the ground; if you tap a
button after a tech roll you'll perform the corresponding while-standing-attack;
- you can perform a Backflip (hits mid) if you tap f as soon as you hit the ground;
- you can roll forward or backward using the joystick or roll sideways using 1 (back) or D+1
(front); after a roll you can use a rising mid kick or a rising low kick;
- with b,B+3+4 you can do a Spiral Lunge that leaves you back turned. Quite useful if you
want to surprise the opponent that's running towards you to try an okizeme. Remember that the
back turned position leaves you quite vulnerable;
- with f,F+1+2 you can perform a Head dive. Use it when you are at a medium distance from
the opponent. If you hit the opponent, he will be knocked down and you'll have the chance
for okizeme;
- with d+4 you can perform a quick Ankle Kick, good to interrupt an okizeme attempt.
About sidestep, you have to learn to use it at the right moment and remember that you can't
avoid every move easily as some of them like Mishimas' Thunder God Fists and some unblockables
will "follow" you even during the sidestep, so you'll have to choose your time perfectly.
Moreover the sidestep may prove useful to perform moves that don't have a "quick" command
(like the DDT or the Tombstone Piledriver). Learn to use the sidestep at the right moment
since Armor King can count on a quite wide ark while doing it and that's a very good thing,
that allows to avoid many annoying attacks (for example Lei's Razor Rush) and get behind or
at the side of the opponent and have the possibility to punish him.
The parry it's not, in my opinion, a fundamental technique: all the characters can perform
a low parry simply tapping df at the moment the low hit is going to strike. Some other character,
like Law or Bryan, can use also an high/mid hit parry but, as Armor King has not this possibility
I will not speak about it. Therefore if you want to use the low parry, try to use it to
interrupt opponents that are trying tenstrings or others strings that you know have low hits
at a certain point. You'll notice that sometimes is better to block the low hit and follow
with a quick counter attack.

+ Tagging +

Tagging in is another thing that's important to learn. For example, if you tag in at the
wrong moment and the opponent is near, you'll take a guaranteed hit like a Phoenix Smasher,
a Mach Breaker, an unblockable, or one of your opponent's juggle starters and you don't want
this to happen. You have many different ways to tag in: with f,f,f,N,1+2 you can perform a
Head Dive; with f,f,N,4,4,4 you can perform 3 Stagger Kicks: very useful as they hit low and
quite quickly.

USE OF THE MOVES:

+ Throws and multiparts +

Knee Bash (1+3): follow it with some okizeme technique, like the Staggers Kicks; you can follow
the throw with the Corporate Elbow too, but you have to  be very fast. Other good follow-ups for
this throw are the Double Shin Kick, or the Black Shoulder (on someone who's rolling forward or
backward to get up) even if they are not guaranteed.

Suplex (2+4): if you want to use this throw, always link it into the Jumping Pile Driver: it looks
better, it inflicts more damage and favours okizeme. When the Jumping Pile Driver link starts,
the throw is not escapable.

Side throws (any normal or command throw performed close to opponent's left or right side): maybe
it's strange to say but I don't use side throws often. They can be avoided easily as they have
a one-button escape so I use the Uppercut, a Jumping Roundhouse or, best of all, use the Palm
Upper to start a juggle. You can follow the Reverse Death Valley Bomb with the Mount Position,
Mounted Punches.  

Reverse DDT (any normal or command throw performed close to opponent's back side): when your
opponent is backturned, use this a lot as it is better of a juggle. 55 pts of damage are a
considerable amount of damage.

Giant Swing (f,HCF+1): a good throw, easy to perform and to setup after a punch string that has
a drawback: it can be tech rolled and the damage halved. Nevertheless, after it you can try a
running attack. You can do it immediately after the Blind Kick: on a backturned opponent you'll
have much more possibilities to land the throw (for example tag with Hwoarang's Sky Rocket
(f,N,d,df+4) do a Crouch Dash to go under the opponent and when he hits the ground and tech rolls
do the Blind Kick). 

Pile Driver (QCF+1): I don't use it a lot as it's only 25 pts damage, even if you have 3 Staggers
Kicks granted after it.

Tombstone Piledriver (db,F+2): the strongest throw in Armor King's arsenal (remember that the
Giant Swing can be tech rolled). Plus, you can try an okizeme after it. The great drawback of
the Tombstone Piledriver is the command: there aren't a lot of joysticks with good diagonals.
Lately I learnt (thanks go to "invincible" Bax for this) a very simple trick that allows you to
perform the Tombstone every time you want: simply tap db twice, then f+2. You can follow the
Tombstone with the Mount Position, Mounted Punches. Another great way to perform the Tombstone,
and this method is better than the 2 x db method, is d~db,F+2 (I removed the version suggested
by IluvMoMo as we have discussed about it on ICQ and discovered that the last method is better
than doing QCB,F+2).

DDT (db,DB+1+2): interesting, the motion is easier and faster than King's version but, as I said
for the Tombstone Piledriver, there's the problem of the diagonals. Good amount of damage and
rising low kick guaranteed after it. In terms of strategy, I think that the DDT has a best
retaliatory meaning when used by King, as the command to perform involves a crouch (d,db,d,DB+1+2)
and so it can be used after avoiding an high attack or after a crouching punch. With Armor King,
as the command it's quite different, a good use of this throw is during a sidestep game or after
a quick punch string (like the Left Straight Light Upper or the first two punches of the tenstring).
I recommend to use this throw a lot to pressure the opponent alternating it with other throws,
as it has a 2 button escape and a guaranteed okizeme after it as I stated before.

Armor King Driver (d,DB+2+4): use it only if you have King as a partner, and you want to tag out
in a different, and spectacular, way.

Mount Position, Mounted Punches (DB+1+3_DB+2+4, then 1,2,1,2,1,2): I use this move only after the
Shadow Lariat or the Lifting Elbow, as after being hit by these moves the opponent is face down,
and the Punches that follow the Mount Position done as a ground throw on a BK opponent cannot be
reversed (the first punch that follows the Ultimate Tackle on a backturned opponent can be reversed
with 1 if it's a left punch, with 2 if it's a right punch. The second, third, fourth and fifth
punches cannot be reversed). You can use the Mount Position infinite times on an opponent that's
face down as after every mount he will be stunned for enough time to allow you to do another mount
and so on. This glitch (known as "Armor King cuffs") is possible ONLY when the opponent is face
down and only on the arcade version of TTT. Therefore, don't use this "bastard variant" if you
don't want your opponent to kill you because you won with such a cheap move. You can follow the
Mount Position with the Elbow Drop or the Corporate Elbow instead of the Mounted Punches.

Frankensteiner (df+3+4): if it connects properly (near the opponent), it becomes a throw that
inflicts a good amount of damage. Use it when the opponent tags in and you are at close distance.
Another good use of this move is after a blocked Jumping Knee: immediately after getting blocked,
try the Frankensteiner. You can also tag out after this move.

Multiparts (see +Multiparts+): use them as a part of your Crouch Dash confusing strategy. Remember
that Armor King has only a multipart starter, that can be easily escaped with 1+2, but multiparts
remain a good opportunity of damage. If the starter lands, feel free of follow with the sequence
you prefer; even if 2) and 3) are the most damaging, their enders are both preceeded by the
Falling Sleeper Chain Throw, that's easy escapable with 2, so use also 1) sequence: you'll be
less predictable and your multipart will be harder to interrupt. 

+ Arts +

Hammer Strike (df+1): use this when the opponent is trying a combo: you will knock him on the
ground and have an okizeme possibility with the Double Shin Kick. Use it also on grounded opponents
that are trying to getting up rolling.

Gut Punch (df+2): even if this move has the same name as Kazuya's, it's completely different
and quite useless. 

Left Right Upper (1,2,1): use them a lot like a counter, because they are fast and damaging.

Shadow Lariat (f,N,d,df+1): a very good move: fast, damaging and allows you to perform a granted
Mount Position, Mounted Punches; plus, if you don't want to follow the Mount Position with
the punches, you can try a granted Elbow Drop or a Corporate Elbow. If blocked, this move
lets you recover without problems. You can use it also during juggles, even if you have to
be very fast. It's very good against tag-ins if you are at a distance that doesn't allow you
to try a Palm Upper.

Left Straight Light Upper (d+1~2): a fast and useful string that you can use to stop an opponent
that's trying to attack or also when the round starts. Very useful to stop all kinds of strings
and to setup the DDT or the Giant Swing. Sometimes I use only the first punch, that hits mid
and leaves Armor King in crouch position, to trap the opponent doing after it a Lifting Elbow
and have more possibilities to score a counter hit.

Water Parting Chop (b+1): I don't use it a lot because it has a quite long recovery time and
because it hits high; you can try to use it when the opponent tags in and you are at close
distance or during juggles, right after a Palm Upper. If you hit the opponent he will be
stunned and you'll have the opportunity to get closer and start a guessing game, choosing
between a good throw or a power hit with Palm Upper or Jumping Knee. 

Lifting Elbow (WS+1): a strange move, that can cause problems to the opponent if it hits on
counter: he will be backturned, and you'll have the opportunity of starting a juggle with a
Palm Upper; you can also try a Konvict Kick or a Shadow Lariat. The Reverse DDT is not granted
as you need time to get near the opponent. If the Lifting Elbow doesn't counter, the opponent
will be face down head towards so you can follow it with Mount Position, Mounted Punches;
otherwise you can start some good juggles (see the section). If you hit a backturned opponent
with the Lifting Elbow, the move will become a juggle starter.

Palm Upper (f,N,d,df+2): the best juggle starter in your arsenal since you'll be safe from
retaliation if it's blocked and be able to cause great damage if you hit. Don't use it always,
but mix it with the other moves that start with a Crouch Dash or you'll eat a reversal. You can
tag out after this move. A note about its hitting property: special mid, so the opponent can
block it even while crouching. Use this fact to take advantage and alternate it with the Jumping
Knee, that needs standing guard to be blocked.

Crouching Uppercut (D,DF+2): an interesting move. Use it to stop an high attack or after
avoiding a throw attempt and juggle at the same time.

Uppercut (SS+2): try to use it to stop an opponent that is getting near to try a throw or that
has started a string. I use it more than the side throws, as throws are easy to escape. Moreover
it is a quite damaging move, stuns on hit, interrupting well an attacking strategy and allowing
you to start some pressure with a Crouch Dash mix up or a low attack like the Double Shin Kick.
A note about hitting backturned opponents: they will be pushed away a little and I think that
the Konvict Kick will be guaranteed (maybe the Shadow Lariat, thanks to its speed and range, or
the Palm Upper too, but I'm not sure). 

Jab Uppercut (2,1): use it only during a juggle. In close combat it's too easily reversable and
slow.

K's Flicker (f,f+2): use this move as a counter. If you're smart, you can learn to use it as a
counter adding another juggle starter to your arsenal. Like the Konvict Kick, you can perform
this move after a Crouch Dash, tapping f,N,d,df,F+2. 

Stomach Smash (f,f,N+2): You can't link it with an "automatic" throw like King, but if you
manage to stun the opponent, you can try to follow it with a Tombstone, even if it's quite hard
to do correctly and quickly  the command. You can follow the Stomach Smash with a Toll Kick or a
Konvict Kick if you can't perform consistenly the throw follow up.

Capital Punishment (f_uf+1+2): I use this move after juggles or after sending the opponent to
the ground. You'll get a granted and quite damaging hit if the opponent tries to get up except
for side roll get ups: in the last case in fact, you'll be open to a side throw or any other
type of attack. When you use this move try to "foresee" how the opponent gets up.

Head First Lunge (f,f+1+2): when I do this move, if I get blocked I try a Left Straight Light
Upper string. Therefore, you don't have a very fast recovery after the move and often you will
be thrown or hit. Don't use this move, it's better.

Burning Knuckle (f+1+2~D_uf,N,D+1+2): this unblockable has to be used carefully: it can surprise
almost every  opponent, even experts but it can be prevented and avoided easily with a simple
sidestep. When you use this move try to calculate distances: if you land close to your opponent
but you don't hit him, you will be completely vulnerable. A plus of this move is that if you
jump behind the opponent Armor King will turn and still hit.

Corporate Elbow (d+1+2): I use it after the Knee Bash, or to finish a juggle when the opponent
is on the ground (see "Juggles" section). Can be also a good follow up after a Mount Position
done on an opponent that has head down.

Toll Kick (b+3): excellent as juggle ender (but not so powerful) and as a counter move. Its good
priority gives you the  opportunity to take away the opponent if you are under pressure or tag
out if in trouble. Remember that it's high so don't abuse it if you don't want to suffer WS counter
hits and remember to buffer chicken (f+1+3) in case of a reversal .

Blind Kick (BK+3): very good to surprise and stun someone who wants to attack when you are back
turned. You can try this move also after the Frankensteiner (throw). However it's not very fast
and remember that the back turned position is not very safe as you can't count on other specific
moves like Lei or Xiaoyu.

Konvict Kick (f,f+4): use it to hit at mid/long distance, to finish juggles or hit an opponent
when he tags in. Don't use a lot on players that use reversals or you'll have to regret. You can
perform this move even after a Crouch Dash, simply tapping f,N,d,df,F+4.

Jumping Knee (f,N,d,df+4): a very good move, maybe Armor King's best Crouch Dash move. It can't
be reversed so alternate it with the Shadow Lariat, that hits high, and the Palm Upper. If the
opponent crouches he will get the hit and a good amount of damage. You can use this move to hit
big characters like the Jacks or Kuma when they are on the ground and try to get up rolling forward
or to hit them during a juggle (thanks go to Lee for this).

Stagger Kicks (d+3+4,4,4_D,DF+4,4,4): use this move as an okizeme or when opponent tags in and
tries an attack: you'll crouch, avoid the attack and hit. Plus if you hit on counter you can perform
5 kicks instead of the standard 3. Good as juggle finishers too.

Straight Arrow (b+1+4): use it only with beginners and with computer in the first stages. It's
too slow and even an intermediate fighter will punish you. Therefore, if you manage to hit on
counter, follow the move with a Palm Upper to start a juggle. It can be used, with good timing,
to avoid and counter some strings but I have to practice it before being more precise.

Black Shoulder (f+1+4): the great advantages of this move are priority and good damage. Use it
mainly on opponents that try to get up rolling away, that are charging an unblockable attack, or
that are tagging in.

Double Shin Kick (db+4): (wé!) I use it to surprise the opponent and hit low, or as an okizeme.
The great drawback of this move is the very low damage it inflicts. Use a lot this move when you
want to be aggressive and pressure your opponent, alternating it with the Jumping Knee.

Mini Spinning Headboot (3+4): use it when you want to hit high and your opponent is at mid distance.
It's quite quick and damaging, very good to hit opponents who rely a lot on throws.

Drop Kick (f,f+3+4): I don't use this move because it's slow, and Jumping Roundhouse and Mini
Spinning Headboot are much better alternatives.

Running Drop Kick (WR+3+4): can inflict high damage but you will hit the opponent with this
0,00000001 times you'll try it. The only moment that comes to my mind when you can use this move
is after the Giant Swing: throw the opponent than start running, if he tags out you'll hit the
other character that's just come in.

Jumping Roundhouse (SS+3+4): use it as an alternative to side throws or when opponent is not at
throw distance. I think this move is better than the Mini Spinning Headboot: the sidestep position
is better for this move as leaves you recover with less risk to suffer okizeme from your opponent.

Jump Moon Drop (U,N+1+4_UF,N+1+4)): it's the same as  King's but, because of its stupid command,
you'll have to wait centuries before hitting someone with it.

Elbow Drop (U+2+4_UF+2+4_UB+2+4): I use this move only as an alternative to Mounted Punches done
after the Mount Position as a ground throw; moreover, note that the Elbow Drop is quite more damaging
than the punches so...

Double Knee Drop (UF+3+4): I don't think you'll never use this move: if you do, maybe you want your
opponent to beat you with no problems during the recovery time.

Tenstring (1,2,1,1,2,4,4,4,1,3): use the complete string only with beginners as they will take it
all; with other players simply use the first 2,3 punches as they are quite quick. The rest of the
string is easy to block and during the 3 Stagger Kicks, the opponent can parry and follow with
guaranteed juggle starters, so be warned.

CHARACTER STRATEGIES:

In this section  I'll try to explain a possible strategical behaviour against human opponents,
suggesting the possible moves that will be used. I want to make clear that everyone uses in a
different way a particular char or team so think about this part of the Faq as an explanation
of my fighting experience with people that have their own styles.

Bryan Fury: Bryan can be a very hard opponent as he can make great pressure and count on good
power. In TTT he gained a new and very useful tool: a punch parry (b+1+2 to parry, then 2 to
reverse) that automatically reverses left punches with a Mach Punch and right punches with a
df+2 punch that I think has a guaranteed f,f+4 kick follow up. Beware from his left standard
throw (1+3) since after it Bryan has the opportunity to hit you with a Snake Edge (df+3) if you
remain on the ground or try to roll sideways or hit you with a f,f+3 kick if you try to roll
forwards or backwards. Bryan has a good while-standing game, thanks to his left knee strike (WS+3)
that can cause stun on counter hit and followed with a WS+1 punch to start juggles (you MUST
escape the knee stun hitting 5 immediately after being hit if you don't want to lose lots of
energy), the Chains of Misery (D,df,d,df+1+2), one of the best looking throws IMO, that requires
a 2-button escape (1+2). A good strategy against him is to use a lot short punch strings, Left
Straight Light Upper above all, to interrupt his attacks without too many risks about the punch
parry. Try to keep Armor King at mid distance as long as possible, to prevent throws and to have
more opportunities to see his 3,2,1,2_4 mixups start and interrupt them. Alternate a lot your
Crouch Dash techniques, mainly the Palm Upper and the Jumping Knee, and learn to block on reaction
the Snake Edge (fortunately Bryan has not many other low hit possibilities). Use the Konvict Kick
to keep the distance during the match and sometimes make a rapid rush to try one of you throws
(DDT is the best choice).

Ganryu: a great character, maybe the best big character in the game together with Gunjack (IMO).
He gained a punch parry that allows him to get behind you and have free and powerful hit with a
Rushing Back Grab (1+2) or Quick Sumo Rush (f+1+2); he has also the new Low Leg Swipe (df+3) that
is surprisingly strong and fast (granted after 1+3 and F+2+4 throws) and his old (but now very
useful for damaging tag combos) Megaton Float (b,db,d,DF+1). But  during the fight, the best weapon
he has it's the Stunning Push (d+1+2_SS+1+2) that is fast, interrupts easily strings and stuns for
a short period of time and improves a lot his sidestep game; the Palm Lift (D+1+2) that can fool
as it hits low and NOT mid. Against him some of Armor King standard juggles may be a little more
difficult as he will not fly high like normal sized characters, but you can try some "special"
combos that work only on big characters. Therefore against Ganryu you'll have to face a good variety
of attacks and must have a  good blocking timing (for example to block the Palm Lift), try short
strings to set up throws (sometimes I try the Frankensteiner after a blocked string), use a lot
the Jumping Knee to hit crouching and parry-happy opponents and don't forget the Double Shin Kick
for a quick and unexpected low hit.

Lei Wulong: this char can be a real problem in the hands of an expert player as it has power
combined with good speed and guessing game. The most famous thing about Lei are obviously  his
animal fighting stances, that can be activated in various ways, but mainly during his Razor Rush
(f,N,1,2,1,2) and after the Rave Spin (DB+4). When in a particular fighting stance, Lei can count
on specific moves: I'll try to discuss every one of them and try to explain a possible behaviour.
Snake stance: has only high block [...]
Panther stance: [...]
Dragon stance: [...]
Crane stance: [...]
Tiger stance: [...]
Drunken stance: [...]
But Lei has not only stances, he has the Razor Rush that has great priority and inflicts high
damage, the Cannonball headbutt that's incredibly useful for avoiding throw attempts. A good way
to face the "supercop" is to improve your sidestep game, as the Uppercut is a very good tool to
stop his rush, moreover if you manage to get behind him with a sidestep you can punish him with
your Palm Upper and follow with a good juggle: if you see that he's starting to use animal stances
don't be hurried as by switching them using up or down taps Lei can count on  a wide  sidestep angle
that allows deadly counterattacks, so if you are at good distance and don't want to risk use tag-in
attacks, mainly the Stagger Kicks, or the Konvict Kick that has long and safe range.

Forest Law: one of the quickest characters in the game, very well balanced, with a good and powerful
counter hit game, that can start damaging juggles. Don't try to hit him if you are not sure that he
can't face your attack or you will eat one of his counter techniques (remember that he can delay his
B+1,2,1 punch string to trap you on counter and juggle) like his Flip Kick strings (d+2~3 is a very
dangerous counter against your high punch strings so press him with Left Straight Light Upper or
simply with d+1). Pay attention to his Dragon's Tail sweep (db+4) as some Law players will alternate
it with Flip Kicks during  pressing strategies causing you some trouble, but remember that the sweep
is slow enough to see it coming and  then block low. Concerning WS game, Law can count on Flip Kicks
and on a new "Mortal Kombat"-like uppercut (WS+2) that juggles quite high. About sidestep, you have
to worry about the Bicycle Kick (SS+3+4) that's very powerful and can be used effectively to hit people
that tries to get up from ground rolling forward or sideways, and in terms of Armor King's moves, the
Konvict Kick, Palm Upper, the Jumping Knee can be easily sidestepped if used in a predictable way; the
Gut Punch Massacre string will be dangerous only on counter as all the hits will be guaranteed, but
this fact happens rarely if you are carefully enough (moreover, Law players will always use the Bicycle
Kick as it is much safer). To face Law, I suggest not to be static, make good use of the sidestep and
Uppercut, use the Hammer Strike as it has good priority and allows you  to try a Double Shin Kick if it
hits on counter; I also reccomend to avoid mad rushes as Law can counter easily and punish you.

Kazuya Mishima: Kazuya is back in TTT, and you can have an idea about him simply using a word:
EFFECTIVENESS. He's probably one of the chars that has a not-so-long movelist, but each move can have
a specific role in his combact strategy. He has lost the most useful version of the Twin Pistons
(df+1,2), but can use them as a good WS technique and his WS+2-stun-power has been reduced significantly
by the introduction of the stun escape (press 5 immediately after being stunned); however he still has
the possibility after some stunning moves like the Glory Demon Fist (f+1+2) and the Demon Gutpunch (df+2)
to inflict addictional damage using the ultra famous, powerful, too useful juggle starter WGF
[(f,N,d,df+2)_(f,N,DF+2)] for those who passed the last 3-4 in space and never heard about Tekken, Axe
Kicks [(df+4,4)_(WS+4,4)_(QCF+4,4)], Hell Sweeps [(f,N,d,DF+4,4)_(f,N,DF+4,4)]. IMO Kazuya has another
great tool: the Mist Step (f,N) that allows him to do a little sidestep and perform  some of his moves
(WGF, TGF and Hell Sweeps) in a faster and less predictable  way. WGF and Hell Sweep seem to be the moves
that take the major advantages: the former gains even more priority and speed, the latter an higher
usefulness (good okizeme possibility and unpredictability). About other moves Kazuya can count on Mishima's
trademark punch string (1,1,2 the last hit is delayable) that's guaranteed when the first punch hits
and a very good  new string, the 1-2 Punches-Stature Kick (1,2,4) mainly for the last kick that hits
low and can be alternated with the Axe Kick to create confusion. You have to keep clear in your mind
that Armor King is a bit slower than Kazuya (mainly because Kazuya can use the Mist Step cancel to speed
up some of his moves), so you won't score a lot of counter hits, but maybe suffer them, so master the stun
escape if the opponent uses a lot WS Kazuya Gutpunch instead of Twin Pistons and never abuse mid distance
attacks. You can count a lot on throws (set up them in your punch strings and alternate them a lot, DDT,
Jumping Piledriver and Piledriver are good choices) and on the hop kick (UF+4) that's quite useful to stop
crouch dash attempts and start some juggle.

Lee Chaolan: Lee gained a lot of new moves for his return in TTT, giving him a particular style. The most
notable improvement is the Hitman Stance that can be activated pressing 3+4 or buffering it after some
combos: the first thing to notice is that Lee will automatically block high and mid attacks so you'll have
to pay attention; moreover, while in Hitman Lee can count on a wide sidestep simply tapping up or down,
still remaining in stance and having the possibility to attack you safely. About the attacks that come out
from the Hitman, pay attention to quick punches (1,1,1,etc) that have very good priority and are extremely
annoying as they can interrupt and force you to retreat and restart with your attack; the Uppercut (2) hits
mid, juggles you allowing a granted and quite damaging Silver Sting (f+3+4) follow up; the Snake Edge (4)
hits low and has granted follow ups too, but it's quite slow, so you shouldn't have problems about blocking
or low parrying it and counter as Lee will be staggered after getting blocked; the last move during the
Hitman is the Scatter Kick that hits high, not a great threat.
Against the Hitman, I haven't a lot of hints: usually I try quick punches if I am at close distance to
interrupt Hitman Stance attacks or use the Double Shin Kick to surprise the opponent, if I'm at long distance
I use a Stagger Kick or two to get near and try to hit. About blocking against a Hitman Lee I usually keep
blocking high since, as I said before, the only low move that comes from the stance is quite slow. Besides,
Lee has a good variation of attacks: the Flash Kicks (f+4,4,4,4) that, as their name suggests, can be quite
annoying since they have very high speed and interrupting properties; the Silver Tail (d,df+4) that's a low
and quite fast sweep that can force you to expose your side if it hits on CH, quite good for okizeme and the
very deceptive Slice Kick (db+3); Lee has also the Mist Trap (b+3~3 blocked, and immediately followed with 4)
that can cause you some problems if you keep defending, but it's quite hard to do consistently, so you won't
suffer it a lot; the last kick move that you have to face carefully is the Lee Cutter (b,b+4) a high kick with
good range that can be followed with the Hitman Stance. Beginners abuse the Razor Edge Kick Combo (d+4,4,4,4
then 3 for the Hitman Stance) that consits of three low hits and a mid kick that can activate the Hitman: I
suggest to parry the second or third kick so you wan't have to guess what move the opponent will perform while
in stance; the move can be much more annoying if the kicks are delayed, in that case don't be hasty and block
the combo without trying to counter the kicks or you may risk to get confused and get hit by the final mid
kick. Speaking about punches, the Triple Fang string (b+1,1,2 the Hitman Stance can be entered after the
second hit -> b+1,1,3+4) has good evasive properties as Lee will retreat a little before starting it and thanks
to the possibility to cancel the third hit with the Hitman can trap you sometimes. Lee hasn't a lot of effective
juggle starters: his famous Blazing Kick (d,DB+4) that will launch you very high and start damaging combos
can be a dangerous attack if you don't know how to tag in safely so don't change character if the opponent
is attacking, try to hit him with a knock down blow and then tag out; when it is used during normal combats
it can be sidestepped quite easily, and you can punish with a Palm Upper to start juggles or a Jumping
Roundhouse for a quick and damaging hit; the hop kick (uf+4) can be dangerous if you duck a lot or if you
use continuously the Crouch Dash without paying attention.

Bruce Irvin: one word of advice: BE CAREFUL. Bruce can inflict ridicolously high damage simply hitting you
with a CH standing left kick to start his famous 3,2,1 Gatling string; after juggling with it he can perform
his Triple Knee Combo (b+4,3,4) and cause great damage: moreover the knees are linkable to all Bruce's juggle
starters, like Face Buster (df+2), the Hopkick (uf+4), the Nightmare Low Heel Kick (b,b+4) and the Rising Knee
(b,f+4) and grant a minimum damage of 50 pts. Juggles aren't the only menace that you'll have to face against
Bruce since he has also a good amount of strings that can inflict great damage if done as counter hit: his 1-2
Punches (1,2) have great interrupting properties and, on CH, allow a guaranteed 2,f+4 follow up; after 1-2
Punches you'll see often the front kick (4) ending, since it's quick, hits mid, inflicts good damage and is
safe if blocked; another CH string is the Southern Cross (1,4,3) that has great range, a high amount of damage,
guaranteed if the first jab connects on counter.
Concerning throws, please note that Bruce's multipart has two main links, the Tumbleweed (1+2,1+2,1+2 that
ends the first possible sequence) and the Left Knee Strike (3_4, 1+2+3), the former escapable with 1 the
latter leads to an unescapable and very damaging ender, the Rising Knee (2,4,1,1+2+3) after the Tourning Knee
(1,3,1+2+4); however the multipart is the only special move that starts with a Crouch Dash, so you shouldn't
have problems about seeing it. Bruce can be very aggressive starting pressure, force you to attack and punish
if you whiff or are hit on counter or adopt a defensive behaviour, waiting for a mistake and strike on counter;
so you can decide the kind of strategy to adopt: for the first type of opponent I suggest to use punch strings
a lot, to face his great interrupting power and "counter pressure" effectively mixing the Double Shin Kick with
the Konvict Kick, then restart with punch strings, try a throw, crouching jabs to Lifting Elbow traps or Stomach
Smash, you have lots of alternatives, so don't get afraid if you are facing an aggressive Bruce player, since
you have a lot of weapons to react properly. I think that you'll find a formidable help in throws and sidestep,
as Bruce will be often close using his strings and try to juggle you, allowing to choose between a good DDT or
an evading sidestep to gain a little space and strike. The second "type" of Bruce can be more dangerous than the
first, since a predictable move will open your defence and allow the opponent to score a counter hit and all the
follow ups that Bruce has (I'm referring to juggles and guaranteed strings mentioned above) and even multiparts
if you whiff moves that have long recovery time like the Double Shin Kick or basic throws, even if it's the minor
threat. Try to play defensive too, trying to stimulate a reaction and find a possible opening to strike with a
good juggle, then rush and do a Giant Swing: the opponent maybe won't foresee a similar behaviour, will have to
try to tech the throw to halve the damage, prepare for your following attack, being always subdued to your
gameplay. I find this strategy quite useful and easy to adopt, I hope you'll have good results with it.

Kunimitsu: a very original character, no more a clone of Yoshimitsu. She gained a lot of evasive moves that can
punish you if you attack recklessly, but however you won't suffer great damage in any case. When fighting against
Kunimitsu, pay attention to her df+2 uppercut that, even if not as good as Yoshi's, has good priority and can
juggle you. Moreover, there are a couple of techniques that I've seen used by one of my friends at the arcade:
the first involves the Spinning Hilt Strikes (b+1,1,1,1,1,1) "cancelled" into the Jumping Headthrow (f+1+4) or
Jumping Spinkick (uf+4), Growling Jewel (f+3+4), the last involves the Reverse Flipkick (BK+3); after doing a
brief Spinning Hilt Strikes (for example b+1,1) Kuni stops and immediately grabs the opponent with the Jumping
Headthrow or hits with one of the above mentioned moves to punish crouching attempts, and this can be a very
annoying strategy since the throw has not a "conventional" button escape (you have to tap df right after being
grabbed) and if you try to crouch to avoid it you have always the risk to suffer a hit: I suggest to use the
standing guard in any case and practice the throw escape (usually I rotate the joystick clockwise, since I find
this way more useful); about the second technique, you have to pay attention when you are on the ground and Kuni
is close: my friend sometimes jumps over me a moment before I do a get up attack and gets behind me, does a
Reverse Flipkick and then hits me one more time with a granted BK 4: there isn't a proper way to face a similar
tactic, simply don't get up from ground trying at all costs to hit.
About other moves, the Fairy Wax (d+3+4) can be annoying as its initial animation (a crouch followed by a jump)
can evade attacks made from mid/close distance and lead to a granted double hit, so don't use punch strings or
moves like the Toll Kick or the Konvict Kick if you aren't sure to force at least a block; the Kunai Skyfall
(u+1+2) it's not a great threat, a well timed standing jab will interrupt it and even allow you to use a little
juggle (for example, after the first jab, f+1, Palm Upper); the Dashing Uppercut (f,f+2) is her second juggle
starter of choice (after df+2), but it's quite slow and has quite long recovery time if blocked so you can choose
to interrupt with a good Left Straight Light Upper or block the move, and decide for a proper retaliation (the
Giant Swing can be good thanks to its quickness or, as usual, the Palm Upper); finally the Jumping Knee (f,f+4)
that's maybe Kuni's best option if you start pressure and she tries to interrupt your attacks.
