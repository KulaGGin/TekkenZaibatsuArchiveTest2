Disclamer:
All references to Tekken 3, Tekken Tag Tournament, Jin Kazama or related material are 
copyright to Namco. This guide is made just on my own opinion on how to do well in a 
battle with Jin and eventually become good enough to really annoy your opponent at the
same time, although these tactics work for me, is not guaranteed to help you!



Introduction:
I started this FAQ after reading a few that were on the Tekken Zaibatsu Site
(http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com) and decided to make one about Jin, as he's quite 
the warrior, but is truly underestimated, I want to show people how I believe Jin is a 
really great fighter, and can outwit the common Cheesy Eddy Gordo Player anyday!

Looking at many of the FAQ's on Tekken Zaibatsu, especially the Catlord FAQ's, inspired me
to start making Tekken FAQ's of my own, after making this one, I plan to make a King FAQ
that shows how to use King to the best of your ability.



Jin Kazama:
What can I say? Jin is a great character to use in a battle, he is a very versatile 
character to use, he has strong, but quick punches, his kicks are great as well, the only
problem with his kicks are, the roundhouses are too easy to see coming. Jin is also fitted
with superb reversals, and of course, the Crouch Dash Ability and the Godfists.

Offensive Players:

Ten Strings:
Go for the (b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,1) or the (b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,d+3+4) Ten Strings as they
have the strange ability to baffle your opponent completely, as there are quite a few low 
attacks in the combo. In my experience, those who block the Thunder Godfist at the end of
the Combo, are completely unable to block either of the Thunder Godfist Add-ons. The best
choice is to use the Low Kick, as odds are, they expect it the less, but if you prefer
power, goes for the Mid Kick.

If you're one of those compulsive people who just wanna smash their opponent senseless,
got for the two Kazuya Originated Godfist Ten Strings (f,f+2,1,2,2,3,4,4,1,2,1) and 
(f,f+2,1,2,2,3,4,4,3,2,1), but try to keep away while performing the first few punches as
its too easy to counter between either the '2,2' or the '2,3' The cleverest idea is to
try the (f,f+2,1,2,2,3,4,4,3,2,1) one, as it has another low move and can damage better.

Word of Wisdom - Only use the (3,2,4,3,1+4,2,2,1,2) or the (3,2,4,3,1+4,2,1) if either
you're feeling lucky, or your opponents vocabulary doesn't include the word 'Block'


Senseless Smashing:
The next few moves say it all really, they do serious damage, knock you opponent back and
forth like they're nothing, but are really efficient:

Demon Paw (f,f,2) Works especially well as counters, gives you well needed room, and boy
                  does it ever send the opponent flying when they're running towards you 
                  and you smash them in the face with that brilliant punch!
                  Who in the hell said that Power and Speed can't work together?

Laser Cannon (b,f+2,1,2) Hehe, what a great move for countering. Not only is it a fairly
                         quick combo as combos go, but if it hits on a Major Counter,
                         the power behind it is amazing. Another rather good thing is
                         if it hits on counter, you can decide to just leave it at the
                         first hit for a Stun Blow, and make up some nice juggle from it.

Thunder Godfist (f,n,d,d/f+1) Good against characters who prefer punches rather than kicks
                              as you can just Crouch Dash underneath your opponent and knock
                              them into Kingdom Come! But, unless you've got a few screws
                              loose, or your opponent is really slow, (character and player)
                              only use it as a counter as its too easy to block or counter.

Wind Godfist (f,n,d,d/f+2) This is great for Juggling, but it uses the same rules as
                           Thunder Godfist as when to use the attack apart from, its quicker
                           so it doesn't always have to work as a counter, but watch them 
                           fly if it does! If you manage to make a good juggle out of this,
                           the opponent is tenderised nicely.


Be Too Quick:
If you wanna win solely on being too quick for your opponent, here's a few good methods:
Use the Shining Fists (1,1,2) and Demon Slayer (1,2,2). These moves are surprising strong 
for their speed, especially the Demon Fists, and dpn't cause too much of a disadvantage when 
blocked, use them against opponents like the Jacks, Kuma, Panda, and True Ogre. If they work
the first time, try again, but don't try more than a couple of times, as your opponent tends
to catch on by then!

Another good idea is to use the Tsunami Kicks, (WS+4) as they are extremely fast and do quite 
a lot of damage if both of the kicks connect, its most efficient when used as a High Counter, 
as you completely avoid the attack when you're crouching, and they have no way to block when
 that foot of Jin's hits them in the head!

Also, another quick move is that Knee Move Jin does, (f+4) it is extremely quick for a kick 
move, and can knock the opponent back if done correctly. Anyone standing in the way can
easily be knocked back by this, and is very handy to use in a combo, as it gives you more
momentum.


Juggling Combos:

Starter Moves:
There are three moves which work well as a juggle starter with Jin:

Uppercut (WS,2) Although it is fairly weak as a rule, it is the simplest and quickest to 
                pull off and so is effective in its own right. Use it for strong moved 
                juggles as it doesn't knock the opponent that high in the air, so the 
                few moves you can do should be strong ones.

Tooth Fairy (SS+2) By far the most effective of Jin's Juggle Starters, it may not be that
                   strong a starter, but boy do they go high in the air! It is perfect
                   for a Large Combo Juggler, and for an added bonus, is performed by a
                   sidestep, so it catches the opponent offguard as well, and you can dodge
                   a pretty good move with it as well.

Wind Godfist (f,n,d,d/f+2) This is Jin's Strongest Juggle Starter that can be said to be at
                           all effective, it is a strong move and knocks the opponent fairly
                           high in the air, so you caa manage quite a few moves with it.
                           Alternatively, you could try for the strong but few option, your
                           choice. Unfortunately, the problem is, when the move hits on
                           counter, the opponent flys far back, making it almost impossible 
                           to juggle. (Trying not to counter, thats a new one!)


Basic Juggling:
The Art of Juggling is a hard and artuous technique to Master, but it sure is worth it!
The thing about Juggles that is so effective, is that unlike combos, its pretty much a no
escape situation, the moment you get hit in the air, you get caned.

It seems apparent to me, that juggling is much harder on Tekken 3 than on Tekken Tag
Tournament, I don't know this for sure, as I haven't had much experience on Tekken Tag
Tournament as I don't own it, because I never got a PS2. 

But anyway, as far as I know, the most effective things to use in a Juggle for Jin, is 
probably either the Laser Cannon Combo (b,f+2,1,2), as not only are the hits powerful and 
fairly fast, but each punch can be delayed for extra conveniance, and the White Heron Combo
(1+4,2,4 or 1+4,2,d+4), as the hits are quick and the actual White Heron Section (1+4) hits
changed from High to Low quite quickly, so you're more likely to hit.

One time, thanks to a clip from Tekken Zaibatsu, I saw a Tournament Match with Ryan Hart from
the good old UK (I myself am British as well) playing as Jin and Heihachi vs Ogre and 
True Ogre, and he seemed to use the following juggle quite effectively 
(f,n,d,d/f+4,1+4,2,f,f+2) which is basically a Hell Sweep, into a White Heron with the extra
punch added, into a Demon Paw. This appears quite effective, and shows how handy White Heron
and Demon Paw are.


Okizeme:
Okizeme, its basically like a juggle, but rather than keeping them from touching the ground,
it prevents them from getting up, I myself have a very hard time doing this, but as you can
expect, Demon Scissors (4~3) is a very handy finish to an Okizeme.

To perform an Okizeme quite efficiently, two good ideas are to either use lots of jabs to 
stop them from touching the ground for a long enough time to get up, or use a Godfist
as soon as you opponent touches the floor properly, as they have practically no time to react, 
and they can reach a fairly low height, just in case the opponent touches the floor properly
without moving. And of course, use the Demon Scissors to finish the job. (4~3)



Defensive Players:

Power Housers:
Ok, this is the first lesson in being annoying with Jin! Hehe!
When your opponent use a very powerful attack like an unblockable, aka Paul Phoenix's Burning
Death Fist, do either of the following:

1) Stand there and get hit: Not very nice to your health, but puts the idea in your 
                            opponents head that you're so confident that you're thinking
                            like this:
			    
                            'Ok, I'll let you hit me with your unblockable, and I'll still 
                             beat you with only a fifth of my energy bar remaining!'
                             Which can be really funny at times.

2) Sidestep a Few Times: Move out of the way, simple enough eh? This leaves the opponent
                         really, and I mean REALLY open for attacks, now proceed to either
                         taunt them by sidestepping more, to show it wasn't a fluke, hit 
                         them, which is simple, but boring, or use a side throw on them. 
                         (Which I prefer to do!)

3) Hit Them to Stop the Move: The simplest possibility that doesn't drain your health, can 
                              make your opponent really annoyed if you do it at the last 
                              minute, use a simple move to really annoy them, its even
                              if you kill them with the simple move.

4) Charge Up a Lightning Screw Godfist: Very funny, charge up a Lightning Screw Godfist 
                                        (b+1+4) for a Laugh, see who gets the hit in 
                                        first, but you see, the special thing about the 
                                        Lightning Screw Godfist is, you can do the less
                                        powerful version, and your opponent doesn't even 
                                        see it coming.

5) Reverse The Unblockable: Hehe, my personal favorite way of dealing with an unblockable
                            just wait until the very last minute, let the opponent think
                            you're a lot worse than you are by standing still then BAM!
                            Reverse the Unblockable (b+1+3 or b+2+4), watch the enemy
                            become shocked by the amount you took off him by using his
                            own move against him, its at its funniest when it actually
                            finishes off the opponent.


Quick Hitters:
Ever been against those kind of people who just jab and jab over and over again?
Those kind of people can be really annoying as you hardly ever get an attack in.
Well, here's how you show them who's boss!

Do the following, either beat them at their own game, as in, wait for them to finish their
little set of jabs, blocking each one, and use some of your own quick attacks as a counter. 
Beating your opponent by doing the same thing they're doing, but better, usually works 
well. The Shining Fists (1,1,2) and the Demon Slayer (1,2,2) are effective in this 
situation. I find that this technique works quite often. 

You can alternatively use a really powerful move, that knocks them senseless, but it quick
enough to work between different sets of jabs. Don't take forever though!
The ideal moves for this are the Laser Cannon Combo (b,f+2,1,2) or the Demon Paw (f,f+2)
as they are very swift and the enemy has a hard time avoiding them after doing all those
quick jabs and other attacks.


The Art of Dodging:
Jin has to have one of the best styles of dodging in Tekken 3 and Tekken Tag Tournament.
Firstly, there is his imfamous Crouch Dash, (f,n,d,d/f) which is really good for not only
dodging high moves, but countering them as well. The Godfists really shine out at this 
point.

Also, use the sidestep, trust me, it is effective with Jin as much as it is with any other
character, if not, more! In this situation, you can either use Tooth Fairy (SS+2) or Side 
Throw the opponent. Sidestep's can be really handy when dodging most attacks, and with Jin
there's no exception, the Tooth Fairy makes Jin's sidestep very useful in the area of
countering as well as dodging.


Annoying Players:
Ok, now here's how you handle those stupid Cheesy Players who can get really annoying at
times, just doing those jammy little repetitive kicks of theirs. I find that sometimes,
even Advanced Players have a problem with dealing with this. There's a few techniques that 
work in this situation. You can choose to do the Tsunami Kicks (WS+4) as the average Eddy
Gordo player, is overwhelmed by the attack, and to my judgement, Chessy Players such as
ones who play as Eddy Gordo just cannot block this if you attempt to counter their move 
with it.

Another good move to use is Jin's Reversing Ability (b+1+3 or b+2+4), this is especially 
handy against enemies that are repetitive and use the same move, as after blocking a few
of their moves, you can guess the exact right time to reverse. This takes an Amateur
Player down really quickly, as they seem not to learn after the first time generally.

Another good idea is to block the opponent's kicks for a while, then hit them with some
quick attacks, preferably, ones that hit low, aka The Hell Sweeps (f,n,d,d/f+4+4)
Also, try to use the Demon Paw (f,f+2) to its best affect, and after knocking them away
either Demon Scissors them if it wasn't on a counter, and Shoulder Ram them if it is on
a counter, as it'll knoc the opponent quite far away and it'll give you some momentum.



Master Players:

How to be a Master:
These are the things you must be good at to master Jin Kazama:

1) Countering with Demon Paw and the Laser Cannon
   You must be able to counter anything with those two moves, if possible, try and learn
   those so well, you can do it blind folded. Its surprising how useful the Laser Cannon
   Combo can be when used as a Major Counter.

2) Juggling with Relative Ease
   You have to learn how to use the Uppercut, Tooth Fairy, and Wind Godfist to the best of
   their ability, you have to stick to a certain few different juggles if you're to be able
   to perform the ones you have already learned without trying. Make sure to use the Laser
   Cannon Combo for a good damaging juggle.

3) Mastering Ten Strings
   Learn all of Jin's Ten Strings off by heart, and learn which ones to use in different 
   situations, aka to use the (b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,1) one against opponents that can block
   but have a hard time against low attacks. And use the (f,f+2,1,2,2,3,4,4,3,2,1) one if
   your opponent just can't block, and gives up completely half way during the combo.

   (3,2,4,3,1+4,2,1) Eight String
   (3,2,4,3,1+4,2,2,1,2)
   (b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,1)
   (b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,d+3+4)
   (f,f+2,1,2,2,3,4,4,1,2,1)
   (f,f+2,1,2,2,3,4,4,3,2,1)

4) Using the Godfists to their Best Ability
   A Master Player can use a Godfist at any given opportunity, but if you're good enough
   you can dodge any high attack and come in with a Wind or Electric Godfist.
   Then, you stand at a real advantage of getting somewhere in a match if you can squirm
   in a Godfist every now and then to counter an attack.


How to Beat One:
Ok, beating a master with Jin, thats a hard one, the fact is, most Masters can learn to
defend and counter rather well, so its merely a case of who slips up first. In this case,
you have to use very random moves, go for the Crouch Dash a little (f,n,d,d/f), and delay 
which move you'll use, even Masters wont anticipate what you'll do. 

Another handy thing to do which oddly enough as it sounds, works. Is to be as simple as
possible, Master Players are used to playing against people with at least some skill,
they don't expect you to do something simple, but, to be confusing, once your opponent
gets to grips with what you're doing, go insane, use Godfists, Demon Paws (f,f+2) and 
Laser Cannons galore (b,f+2,1,2), they wont see it coming, if you're that authentic that 
they're really taken offguard, try for the (b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,1) or 
(b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,d+3+4) Ten String.


How to Annoy Them:
Ok, to Annoy a Master, you can do one of the following, do something like the Mini 
Lightning Screw Uppercut (b+1+4) and actually connect as a counter, as it can annoy the 
enemy because they feel bad about getting hit by such an obvious move. Its funny when
used as a counter as the enemy can do hardly anything about it.

Another thing you can do, is taunt them a little by blocking everything with the Force
Guard (b+1+2) Which really annoys Masters until they catch on and attempt low attacks, 
but when they do get the picture, turn into Devil Jin (b+1+2,2,2,3) and attack them with 
a combo or juggle before they get the chance to attack you. But, its not a good idea to
turn into Devil Jin if you plan to win Perfect, so just attack the opponent if you
don't want to.


The Added Touches:

Damaging Touches:
This section is based on how to truly finish off an opponent by doing a classy finishing
move that beats them senseless, well, here it goes:

Demon Scissors (4~3) Finish off your opponent by flipping on top of them and smashing 
                     their brittled body even deeper into the ground. Great fun!
                     Also works as a nice finish to a Juggle or an Okizeme.

Laser Blow (b,f+2) Use this as a preparation to finish off your opponent as a counter, 
                   and you can see your opponent clutching his stomach, helpless, with
                   no way to avoid your finishing blow, it looks cool as well!

Thunder Godfist (f,n,d,d/f+1) What a neat looking move, it looks great as a finish, and
                              does serious damage, so its a neat way to add a nice touch
                              to the battle, use it as a High Counter and it looks great.

Lightning Screw Godfist (b+1+4) The ultimate cool way to finish off a battlle, it knocks
                                them away like they're nothing and looks great when you
                                replay it, to make it look cooler, do the Force Block
                                (b+1+2) beforehand.


Cool Looking Finishes:
The cool way to finish your opponent is to finish with a rather quick Demon Scissors,
then flip back up (b,b+3+4) as it makes you look like you really wasn't trying at all,
its also cool to finish with the Flip Move if the enemy is dashing into you. It makes
a nice foot mark in the enemies face. Hehe!

Another cool way to finish is to turn into Devil Jin and do a Shoulder Ram as it seems 
really cool to finish off your opponent like that, as its the closest thing to Jin's
'Dirty Blood' Tekken 3 Ending, so its especially funny to use against Heihachi.


Just to Be Mean:
This Section is Dedicated on showing you how to be really mean with Jin even after the KO 
or Perfect Sign shows up. Firstly, you can do the basic things some of my friends do,
like do repetivite kicks, or do the Tsunami Kicks (WS+4) into a Roundhouse. 

Another thing to do is to start the (b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,1) or (b+2,4,4,4,4,2,1+4,2,d+3+4) 
Ten  String, and the first hit kills the opponent, but carry on doing the Ten String,
regardless whether you hit or miss completely, it can be funny at times.

One last way to be mean is to finish off with a Mini Lightning Screw Uppercut (b+1+4),
just watch the opponent fly high in the sky like a big pizza pie, while using little
effort in sending their body flying.



Many Thanks To:
I'd like to thank the people at Tekken Zaibatsu (http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com) for 
helping me enjoy Tekken even more than ever, and getting me back into playing Tekken 3, 
I'd also like to thank Catlord, whose Tekken Psychology Manual got me into 
collecting FAQ's. Also, thanks to all the people who sent Jin Kazama FAQ's to Tekken 
Zaibatsu, as they inspired me to start one of my own. Thanks to my friends at home,
whose patheticness at Tekken 3 gave me much needed practice in those 8 vs 2 Handicap
Team Battles, which I won, even though I only had two people. And finally, thanks to
Namco, for making such an awe-inspiring series of Beat-em-ups.



Final Words:
Jin Kazama rules, Devil Jin is godlike, and all those who defy him shall face his
ultimate wrath! Watch out all those Eddy Gordo Players out there, Jin Kazama's coming
to get you, no matter who's playing him!
