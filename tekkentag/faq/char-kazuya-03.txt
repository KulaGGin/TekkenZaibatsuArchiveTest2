v 1.0 First release of the guide. Rather incomplete and there are still 
      some sections not filled in yet.

      Hwoarang, Julia, Michelle. Small update on Wave Dash section and
      Sidestepping strategy.

      Not to parry section. Some corrections to other sections. New 
      info added. Websites also updated! f+1+2 is not that bad after    
      all. Almost every section has some updates.
FINAL Immediately after v3.0 was out, Bluu inevitably dug up loads of 
      stuff which needed correction. Well most of them are corrected
      and I even added some new stuff on the way since I got my PS2.
      A lot of strategy has been revamped for better understanding or
      maybe because the previous strategies were extremely scrubby and 
      dated by today's standards. Also note that this will be the FINAL  
      version (if you haven't guessed by now... DUH!) of the FAQ. Find 
      out why below.

The FINAL version of this FAQ
*****************************

For the faithful followers of my FAQ (not many I guess) you all should 
have known by now that I have already quit TTT because of personal 
reasons. The people in TZ already know why but if you are one of those 
who are a proud new owner of a PS2 and TTT and just browsed 
gamefaqs.com to get an FAQ to read, I thank you for reading my FAQ and 
also tell you why I have decided to quit TTT.
Quitting Tekken, has to be the hardest decision in my life, and it was 
done after my girlfriend, Momo, dumped me, and to be honest, I DESERVE 
to be dumped. Although Tekken cannot be be blamed, I feel that during 
the time when I had her, I would spend more time playing Tekken than 
going out with her etc. Well after a short, 1 year plus relationship, 
she has given up on me and we broke up. It is off course too late for 
me to regret and all I can do now is change for the better. I hope you 
readers of this will take my advice on this - 

" There is no game (or thing) in this world which can be more important 
  than a person."

Do not make the same mistake I have, and take your gaming too seriously. 
There is always a time for everything and anything. 
 
I would like to thank the people at TZ, TC, #tekken, #eurotekken and 
ICQ for making my Tekken playing days a happy and memorable ones. In 
particular and in no order, I'd thank Night, bluu, D_J, RevC, Dayful, 
Chinky-Eye, 7ronko, The Blacksmith,puzzykatz Redfoot, Catlord, Priz, 
MIC, insanelee, Chef, Shinjin, Annaquin, Redking, Kazman, Ikazushi, 
Lomber, Markman, Claka, Tragic, Cel aka Newblood, Asian_Caucasian, 
King_2nd, Deschief, VainJ, Thunderfist, Claka, Shinjin, KazuyaKazama, 
Kenshichan, KazamaCEO, Castel, [Jin], mokuni,  and many many others 
whom I can't remember at the top of my head whether they taught me 
loads of stuff or were just plain funny and made my life happy.

There are obviously flaws in this FAQ, which I will undoubtedly 
surface. I have best imparted my knowledge on TTT, and Kazuya Mishima 
as of the last writing and since this is the final version, please do 
NOT mail/ICQ me anymore about what is right, or wrong or what you think 
about this FAQ. It will NOT be updated anymore.

About the Authour
*****************

I am an 19 year old boy who lives in Ipoh, a small town in Malaysia. 
I currently live in KL, studying my second year in A levels at Taylors 
College. I would consider myself a hardcore gamer and have been playing 
games in the arcades since I was 6 playing the then popular Street 
Fighter II series (the ironic thing about this all is that people under 
18 are banned from going to arcades!... so you would say I had to 
illegally sneak into arcades time and time again) Anyways, back to the 
topic. My first taste of Tekken was Tekken 2 on the Playstation and I 
have to say I never liked it in the first place. (to slow for me) I 
really got into Tekken when Tekken 3 was released for the Playstation, 
and I addictively play Tekken Tag Tournament right now, spending most 
of my allowance in the local arcades learning new combos or practising 
new strategies. I have since quit Tekken and now focusing more towards 
my studies and social life. However should you still want a game of 
Tekken, feel free to contact me via mail or ICQ and hopefully we can 
work some things out. Be forwarned though, I am NOT a player with Mad 
skillz, just an average player who wishes to pass a tip or two to 
would-be Kazuya Players. Writing this FAQ has not been easy as one 
would think since it invovles a lot of time and patience. This FAQ has 
gone through numerous revisions to make it better for you the reader. I 
hope you will therefore enjoy reading it.

*************************
Why another Kazuya Guide?
*************************

It all started back sometime ago when I was creating my very own 
website (which is crap btw). Anyways, my friend Han tzen suggested that 
I should write an FAQ on TTT since I am such a big fan of the game. 
Well I told him that "Hey, I'm not really good at writing this stuff 
especially since I'm not as good compared to all these people here" (of 
course I am not as good as Anash50 who is beyond comparison LOL) He 
told me, "Simple job mate, just take a few FAQs, read it through and 
extract a few points here and there and you have a brand new FAQ." 

However not to be one to plagarize people's stuff, I asked permission 
from Reverend_C to use the format of his FAQ to write about Kazuya 
(which btw is also modified and use in Dayful and my Julia FAQ). At 
first I have to admit, that most of the points were merely a deceptive 
method of rewording Rev's strategy in his FAQ. However upon writing it 
(and playing a lot of TTT in the process) I realized that all the 
guides out there OVERemphasize Kazuya's Demon Gut Punch. Sure it is a 
very damaging attack of Kazuya, but the problem is that the move can be 
tag escaped (or escaped by pushing f) in Tekken Tag Tournament when 
compared to Tekken 2 thus making the move less powerful than it should 
be. I'm not saying its useless, but it is terribly hard to hit the 
Demon Gut Punch on CH against good players consistently. I would say 
the Demon Gut Punch is similar to Nina's db+3+4 in TTT - it is hard to 
land on good players but IF it does land your opponent is in a major 
world of hurt. Sure enough my stand was supported by a few other Kazuya 
players like 7ronko and Chinky-eye and I was not looked upon as a fool 
in the brand new FAQ writing world.

As time passed though, more things have been discovered, some which are 
weird (the crouching teleport glitch for example) and others which are 
very new (WGF after CH df+2) which aren't covered in other FAQs. From 
the last version of the FAQ, I hope that it has covered every single 
detail of Kazuya known accurately, precisely and yet in an interesting 
manner without being too long winded.

***********
Why Kazuya?
***********

For one moment lets try and forget him having one of the best juggle 
starters, the Wind God Fist. And lets forget that he has the Hell 
Sweeps which is stronger than Heichachi's. And lets forget he has all 
those Mishima trademark attacks (shining fists, tsunami kicks etc.) 
Kazuya kicks ass NOT because of his Demon Gut Punch ,WS+2 (which when 
followed up, will almost spell the end of the fight, if not the end of 
the fight, for your opponent). The Demon Gut Punch (now known as DGP) 
stuns you opponent for hell of a long time that you can follow up with 
some painful blows or a juggle. Even a roundhouse kick is extremely 
damaging (which I will get to later). Kazuya has a regular Gut Punch 
(think of it as a burger sans the cheese) which is easier to initiate 
but does not stun as long (you can still get some pretty good hits from 
it though...) and IMO is better than his Demon Gut Punch. Besides just
recently, I found out (more of by accident) that Kazuya CAN indeed 
launch with a WGF after a Gut Punch and Juggle for Major damage.

Among the midst of all the Demon Gut Punch glamour, many players forget 
that Kazuya has the Twin Pistons which is MUCH better than Jin's sorry 
offering. The Twin Pistons is a very useful move as it will juggle as 
long as the 1st hit connects. Sure some people will argue that it does 
not juggle as high as a WGF and there aren't as many juggle options as 
there are after a WGF, but hey, we are talking about a move from a WS 
position. There aren't many moves which comes out of WS position this 
fast, has this good a recovery (take that Heihachi) and most 
importantly JUGGLES! His WS Twin Piston is a very useful especially for 
CD mix-ups.

Moreover, Kazuya's Hell Sweeps isn't as pathetic as say Heihachi's as 
his will trip on the first hit, if you delay the Hell sweep (I'm not 
saying that Heihachi's Hell Sweeps is useless - it can be devastating 
when used in combos.) Plus, Kazuya has the Mist step from which you can 
initiate the Hell Sweeps in an instant and more deceptive manner, thus 
making it almost impossible to block. Speaking of Mist step, his Mist 
step cancel is the easiest and fastest way to get a WGF, Hell Sweep or
TGF from. 

There are a hell load of reasons why you SHOULD play Kaz that 
I won't bothering mentioning here as this will make the FAQ too long, 
so just read on. Kaz is MY favourite character (along with Bruce) in 
Tekken Tag and you can always see me playing him in the arcades.

********************
Kazuya's Weaknesses
********************

1.  His grunts are weird.. he goes *eeYikes* or something. Totally 
    annoying. Gets on my nerves at times.
2.  His Wind God Fist (like Heihachi's) hits special medium now and  
    this kills of the crouch dash guessing game...or does it.... 
    Moreover he does not have EWGF which makes his WGF somewhat risky.
3.  His Demon Gut Punch is easily escaped *boo!*
4.  His Hell Sweeps causes him to stagger (what do you expect for such  
    a powerful kick) when blocked. Also lack of good powerful followups 
    after Hell sweeps like Jin's b+4.
5.  Lack of moves (but at least the moves he has are very good) which 
    means he gets a bit predictable at a higher level of play.
6.  Some of his moves take forever to come out. Example the Glorious 
    Demon Fist (f+1+2) and longer than forver to recover.
7.  No netsu power up with a lot of characters.
8.  Darn... no Tag slides or cross chops! (though mist step after a tag
    in is a nice substitute) That means he can't tag in that extra lil
    bit of damage 
9.  He can't combo as well as say Heihachi or Jin.
10. Only 2 costumes? Mich has 3. Julia has 4. Jin has 5 and he has only
    TWO? WTF?!?

******************************
General Idea on Playing Kazuya
******************************

Although some may tell you that Kazuya is a pure pitbull/ offense 
character, do not believe them. Kazuya should not be played on the
offense all the time. By saying this I mean that against certain 
characters who are faster than him (say the Changs, Law) Kazuya will
be in deep trouble if he goes pitbulling all the time. Does CH 1~2,1 or
CH 4 sound good to you? Well Kazuya does NOT have pokes that are faster
than 10 frames, a fact which will be severely punished by them if you
blindly pitbull. With that said, Kazuya should play defensively on the
counter. Remember, WGF, is your best friend since your WGF, not only 
has high priority, it is the fastest WGF in the damn game. 1 damn frame
can make a difference. Besides, WS+1,2 is another good move if you 
should duck any high moves. Combined, WGF and WS+1,2 make Kaz the 
unstoppable force that he is. Lets not forget Hell sweeps shall we?
The only time Kazuya can be offensive is when your opponent is on the 
ground. Don't believe what people tell you, his Okizeme game is very
dangerous because of his CD. I will go into more of this later in the
Okizeme section. 
Of course the ultimate way of playing Kazuya would be to just abuseee 
his CD mixups. That is if you can do WD/LD properly and consistently 
cancel it to WGF, iWS+1,2 and Hellsweeps at will. This type of Kazuya 
players are almost instoppable in the right hands. In the words of 
tragic (ben cureton) " All a 3D fighter character needs to be powerful 
is a good mid/low mix up game" Certainly Kazuya's iWS+1,2 and Hellsweep 
mixups ranks as the best, ousting out every one and probably even Jin.

***********
Conventions
***********

This is the general convention used in Zaibatsu and is the most widely
excepted. It has been around since the days of Tekken 2 I think.
Anyways veterans of Zaibatsu or any other Tekken FAQs should just skip
this part. Was kinda lazy on doing this so I just copied PMartin's
abrevation and modified it with the legend in Tekken Zaibatsu as
needed. This version of the conventions was copied from mine (and 
Dayful's) Julia FAQ.

Frame Data
***********

I got lazy while doing this update, so I nicked the Frame data from 
DJ's FAQ (which was nicked from TZ) So big props goes to DJ (for having
the patience to write to copy the frame data out..... I know how hard 
and taxing it is not to mention the formatting nightmares you get) and 
also to Castel at Tekken Zaibatsu for putting up the frame data (though 
somehow I feel that there are questionable ones.

So how do you definte a frame? A frame is an animation taking place 
during 1/60 of a second during a fight.  Tekken Tag Tournament runs at 
60 fps (frames per second) or 60Hz, which is in fact almost twice as 
fast as normal television (TV runs at 32 frames)! PAL TTT runs at 50 
fps or 50Hz btw, which makes it look oh so crap.  Now, what does that 
have to do with all this?  Well, in TTT, attacks give you a certain 
frame advantage and disadvantage in certain situations.  For example, 
Kazuya's WGF executes in 11 frames, roughly 1/6 of a second, once 
you've pressed the Right Punch (2) button.  When blocked, a Wind 
Godfist has a 10-frame disadvantage, which means that Kazuya will be 
left open for approximately 1/6 of a second.  If it hits on normal or 
Counter Hit, the opponent will be launched and fall to the ground 
afterwards. 

Here is another important thing - the frames of a move's execution only 
pertain to how fast it comes out WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTON TO DO THE 
ATTACK, and does not take into effect the amount of frames per 
directional input.  So, while a Wind Godfist may execute in 11 frames 
once you press 2, it will take AT LEAST 13 frames overall to come out, 
because it takes at least 2 more frames should you choose to do it via 
Mist step cancel (f=1, n=1, df+2=11, TOTAL = 11+1+1= 13)

It is VERY IMPORTANT to note that sometimes you can block before you 
can actually input a command - this is often the case with minor stuns 
and guard breaks.  Thus a -12 for example doesn't necessarily mean you 
can't block for 12 frames - it means that you cannot attack for 12 
frames.  
Most moves with a disadvantage of 8 or less can be considered safe 
moves as it takes at least 8 for your opponent to execute a standard 
jab and in some cases your opponent will not even be within jab range 
and you have to add on whatever amount of frames it take for him to 
dash within hitting range.  Eddy has to ability to shorten recovery 
time after certain moves with Sidestep or Recover Crouching cancels.  
Each of the Frame Data List columns contain specific move information.  
To keep it all as organized as possible, I have divided the list into 
Throws, Moves, and Unblockables.

Command Column 
Pretty self explanatory, this is how you execute the listed move.  The 
directions are in relation to which way your character is facing, of 
course.

F Hit Column 
Indicates how many frames it takes for a move to hit after you have 
finished the command.  This does NOT included the number of frames it 
takes to input the command.

B Adv Column 
The number of frame advantage or disadvantage when the move is blocked. 
Meaning the amount of frames it takes before you can input a new 
command.  Positive numbers are advantages over your opponent, negative 
numbers indicate a disadvantage and KD indicates the opponent gets 
knocked down.  This can either be a juggle, stun or any other kind of 
knockdown.

H Adv Column 
The number of frame advantage or disadvantage on a hit.  Keep in mind a 
hit does not necessarily results in an advantage over the opponent. 
Frame advantage on stagger moves reflects the amount of stagger frames, 
this does not equal the number of frames your opponent cannot block 
attacks.

CH Adv Column 
The number of frame advantage or disadvantage on a Counter-Hit.  Keep 
in mind a Counter-Hit does not necessarily results in an advantage over 
the opponent.

Move Analysis:
**************

Unlike other FAQs, I am not going to rate any of the moves because even 
if the move seems sucky to me, someone out there may have found a good 
use for it that I haven't, I'm not the lead designer of Tekken Tag so 
who am I to judge anyways? But I'll try here and there to point out the 
excellent moves that you should use often (but not over abuse). First 
off though, I must stress the strategys I have written here is based on 
vs. Humans and not vs. CPUs. If you need some strategy as to how to 
beat the CPU in record time, go look up other FAQs (I'm sure there are 
some out there)



Throws
-------

Command          Name                         Escape  
  
1+3              Bitch Kicks                  1
The good ol Kazuya kick (which Jin also learnt) Gives you two good 
kicks in the face and leaves your opponent on the floor near to you, 
close enough to use some okizeme tactics. You can follow this up with 
Kazuya's UNOFFICIAL move f,n,d,df+3 which is basically a CD into 
d+3 sweep. This is almost guaranteed. However, use this only when your 
opponent starts breaking your stone head throws as most players default 
to 1 for their throw escapes. Just a small note, should Jin be 
partnered with Kazuya (or Jun) Jin's has a "special bitch kick"

2+4              Hip Toss                     2
Throws your opponent over your shoulders to the ground. It does very 
poor damage, even for a normal throw at only 28 points. However your 
basic 2+4 throw which leaves them in PLD position.... PLD you ask me? 
YEAHHHHHHH good opportunity for OB trap if you ask me. Anyways you can 
get a free d+3 I suppose if OB is not your opponent's cup of tea to up 
the damage.

f,f+1+2(~5)      Stone Head                   1+2       
Kazuya's best throw. It is a no nonsense, not flashy, good damage 
double break throw. Does a little more damage than your normal throw 
(33 pts)  but has so many uses. First of all you can do it from a CD or 
dash buffer it (f,n,d,df,f+1+2), which is ideal for those custom 
strings since it helps closes the distance very well. Do NOT abuse 
Stone head set ups though (like CD cancelling to Stone head) since your 
opponent will learn to break it. Secondly if Jun is on your team, you 
can tap 5 to have her safely tag in with an arm bar (damage is 
suprisingly less... but you do get a free FC,df+2 so I guess I 
shouldn't complain too much). Lastly, your opponent will be on the 
ground close to you and the df+4 kick is almost guaranteed (if I'm not 
mistaken, you can escape the df+4 by tech rolling the Stone head, 
something which is easier in TTT than in T3). Even if it isn't you 
still have lots of options for okizeme (like say another throw? - evil 
laugh). In fact, if they have developed a habit for techrolling, then 
nail them with UF+3 which you should pleasantly know is almost 
guaranteed (your opponent can escape it by pushing forward, thanks to 
King_2nd for pointing this out to me). Do note however that Kazuya can 
get a FREE WGF on bigger characters (e.g. Kings) after a stone head as 
demonstrated by Dohee in his Kazuya vid. After a Stonehead, this is a 
good opportunity for you to do some wave dashing and put pressure on 
your opponent. Perfect for OB trap setups :) Problems? Even with its 
double break, the stone head has such a HUGE escape frame that your 
opponent has until Kazuya draws his head all the way back to escape it 
(watch the change of camera angles) Do NOT over use this. When your 
opponent starts breaking it, you know its time to switch to another 
throw.

FC_d_db+1+2      Ultimate Tackle              special          
Chicken Command: f+1+3 for all. Wang's cannot be chickened since it is
                 considered a lp reversal.

Use this on slow witted opponents or those who don't know how to break
reverse this throw. This move is so bad because your opponent has loads 
of time to escape from this throw, and even if it connects he can 
reverse it to his advantage (1+2 just before they hit the ground and 
before you know it they are on top of you) . Moreover this move is slow 
to start of with and your opponent may have already whupped your butt 
before you could even grab him. Even a d+1 will interrupt this move. 
Sadly, Kazuya doesn't even have and arm lock to add more damage (and 
mix things up) which means your chance of hitting your opponent is 50-
50. Oh I guess you could try Ultimate tackle off CD to give it more 
range.... (who cares..??) Come on Namco... what are you doing to him?
Btw, it can be reversed. LOL. I made a dick of myself when asking about
it on Zaibatsu.

1+3_2+4_2+5      Steel Pedal Drop             1
Its a side throw. Most of the new side throws in TTT look cool and this 
is no exception. Kazuya grabs his opponent by the leg and slams them to 
the ground. *OUCH* It does more damage than a normal throw. It can be 
easily escaped unless your opponent was committed to an attack before 
you grabbed him which means he would probably have no idea you were 
going to throw him anyways. Against a good player though, never use 
side throws.

1+3_2+4_2+5      Skull Mash                   2
Other than looking cool and putting your opponent next to you, sideways
in which you can set up OB trap by SS'ing or get in a free d+3, the 
Skull Smash is a side throw which, like all side throws are easily 
escapable. Looks painful though when Kazuya holds his opponent back and 
punches them real hard. Electricity sparks all over. *Ouch*

1+3_2+4_2+5      Reverse Neck Throw           n/a       
Its a back throw therefore it cannot be escaped. Does a good deal of 
damage (50% actually) but nothing in the range of Heihachi's or Yoshi's 
back throw. WGF,4 will do 49% damage so I seldom use this throw. Of 
course one will say that WGF will take a longer time to initiate but 
lets not forget that its also unblockable if your opponent is BT'ed. 
However when your opponent is on the ground, you can still follow up 
with d+3 to up the damage. SUPER boring throw. 


Special Techniques
-------------------

Command                 Name                    Range 
       
1,2                     Double Punch            h,h 
Two fast punches that hits high. Not really useful except when used in 
juggles, but then I myself prefer 1,1 more than 1,2 as 1,1 comes out 
faster, and if the 1,1 connects, the 2 follow up is guaranteed. Just a 
small note, 1,2 has more forward momentum than 1,1 so WGF, 1,2, df+4,4
will always connect but for WGF, 1, 1, df+4,4, the last kick will miss.
(you have to do the tsunami kicks by inputting f,n,d,df,f+4,4) Bluu 
adds, the 1,2 punches have a much better tracking ability compared to
1,1 (from the shining fists discussed later) The tracking ability helps
alot when Kazuya faces fighters who likes to SS alot since they 
generally think that Mishima's track very poorly (which is actually a 
fact). Use this to punish them and knock them silly.


1,2<2                   Demon Slayer            h,h,h
Why do the Mishima's bother teaching their children this move. Other 
than being damaging, this move is rather poor. Slow,three consecutive 
high hits. Use this move when I play Kazuya and you will probably be at 
the receiving end of a Twin Pistons. Of course on the last hit 
(backhand), Kaz's body is surrounded with electricity. The only time 
I'd used this move is when playing against a scrub (but then the move's 
recovery time is soooooo slow that you probably get hit in return if it 
is blocked). Lastly this move doesn't knock down and has no guaranteed 
follow-ups, but if it does connect, it will push your opponent far away 
enough to be safe from retaliation and give you +1 frame advantage. 

This move isn't all that bad as it is made up to be... but Kazuya just 
has better moves. The fact that it hits high will cause a lot of 
headaches for you since if your opponent ducks it, the wiff recovery is 
attrocious. Secondly, even though it is listed as 1,2<2, there is no 
way Kazuya can actually delay the final backhand (unless its a delay of 
1 frame) This makes it hard for a player to react to a situation even 
if 1,2,2 is guaranteed should the first punch hit ala 1,1,2. 1,1,2, just 
beats the hell out of Demon Slayer because of the DELAYABILITY. A good 
player will never risk that extra damage for a wiffed standing 2. Use 
this move in juggles (easy and moderately damaging since Kaz has so few 
juggle options) or if you KNOW that your opponent is trying to parry 
your 1,2<4 stature kick combo with a command low parry (example : 
King's db+1+4) NOT a generic low parry (df).  

p/s I have come to a conclusion that this move may be the 'best' move 
    in the world of Tekken if used correctly, only second to Devil's
    flying lazer. LOL

1,2<4                   Stature Kick            h,h,l
An average move overall since the last kick is quite hard to see coming
but since this is the only other option other than the Demon Slayer (and
good grief I myself wonder who'd use the Demon Slayer in a higher level 
of play) the Stature Kick will be  expected and thus low parried (Demon 
slayer hits high, so holding df will be safe if you complete the 
whole combo) or even blocked. If it is blocked, be prepared to eat a WS 
move. A LOT WSmoves are guaranteed after a block stature kick like the 
Chang's WS+4, Kazuya WS+1,2, or worse a parried stature kick - df+2,1 
juggle with Chang *Shivers* etc. TOO risky if you ask me since the last 
kick does poor damage but a low parry to Julia's df+2,1 combo does an 
unhealthy 70+ points. This move is useful for ticking away the last bit 
of your opponent's life but I still prefer using 1,2, db+4 instead of 
1,2,4 (MUCHHHHH safer though your opponent can interrupt you) and mix 
that up with 1,2, df+2. Throw this once in a while and use it 
SPARRINGLY for heaven's sake. One last thing about the 1,2,4 combo, its 
really fun to do in the WGF, multi jab combo since it has a lot of air 
time and is bound to annoy your opponent since it does lil damage. 
Great for time wasting.

1,1<2                   Shining Fist            h,h,m
If you already know how to play Jin or Heihachi then you might as well 
skip this part. Being a Mishima trademark move, the Shining fist is one 
of the better moves passed down the generations. The 1,1 hits quick and 
will most likely be your poking tool of choice. The last hit hits mid 
and knocks down, which means your opponent won't be able to duck all 
day. Moreover, the last hit comes out pretty fast, therefore, your 
opponent will not have enough time to WS you, but he will still be able 
to interrupt you with d+1. Therefore, 1,1 is ideal in custom strings 
since you can train your opponent to block high before going low with a 
stature kick combo, Hell sweep(s) or a simple throw. In addition to 
that, the 2 can be delayed and thus you may sucker your opponent into 
eating the 2. Another advantage is that if the first punch connects the 
follow up is all but guaranteed. There are times of course where the 
first punch would hit and the second would wiff. In such a case, the 
last punch is NOT guaranteed and will most likely be blocked by your 
opponent which means free juggle. Small note, you may need to delay the 
last punch a bit though since the last punch will inexplicably wiff at 
times which opens you up. However if your opponent blocks the last 
punch (2), be prepared for some hurting as there is a BIGGGG delay in 
recovery. Lastly since it hits so quick, the punches are uncounterable. 
Do not over use this though since characters with quick 8 frame jabs 
will punish severely... people like the Changs who can get a 1~2,1 (CH)
*ouCh!* since your basic jab is 10 frames. Boo! The Shining Fist is 
best used off sidesteps or mist steps in Kazuya's case when you know 
that you don't have enough time to initiate a WGF.

WS+1,2(~5)                Twin Piston             m,m          JG
This is MUCH MUCH better than Jin's Twin Piston (which is only 
guaranteed if the first hit hits on a counter). Thanks to Chinky-Eye for
bringing about this topic in the Zaibatsu forum. In fact this is the 
most important move (along with the WGF) in Kazuya's arsenal. Without 
this, Kaz would not be as good. Basically , Kaz double uppercuts your 
opponent into the air for an juggle. For characters like Hei or Jin 
this would be good but since Kaz has air juggling capability isn't as 
good, it still doesn't diminish the Twin Piston's usefulness. This move 
has forward momentum and is useful in custom strings. More importantly 
though, if the first hit connects the second hit is guaranteed. Just 
make sure you don't whiff this move or you will be at the wrong end of 
Paul's Deathfist. I don't understand why every single Kazuya FAQ out 
there rates this move 3/5 (average move) because I myself find this 
move extremely useful. This move recovers REALLY well. It is just too 
safe a move to ignore and with its priority I have to say this is THE 
BEST MOVE KAZUYA HAS BAR WGF. I mean if Heihachi's Twin Pistons are 
blocked, he has a bit of recovery time, enough for him to be smacked, 
but Kazuya's recovery is almost instant. -6 frames? Punish THAT! Of 
course one may argue that it can only be pulled out from the WS 
position, compared to Angel/ Devil's Twin Pistons which are very 
abusable. Use this in any situation that you would use Jin's WS+2, only 
remember.... it comes out faster but doens't juggle as high and MOST 
importantly has smaller range. For example if you blocked a Hell sweep 
and your opponent is recovering from the sweep stagger, it is more 
advisable to pull off the Twin Pistons because if you connect with the 
Demon Gut Punch, it won't count as a CH or even clean hit, so a juggle 
is a smarter thing to opt for. Well not all instances though since I 
stress again that Jin's WS+2 has better range (comes out a bit slower 
though) Also, the 2nd hit of the TP has the tendency to wiff even if 
the first hit connected at Maximum distance. Also, this would be a 
better move to opt for since it comes out wayyyyy faster than the Demon 
Gut Punch, recovers amazingly fast, has insane priority AND the Demon 
Gut Punch can be tag escaped. Learn to do the Twin Pistons after an 
instant Crouch (d~db,N+2 or d~df,N+2) for an instant WS+1,2 and after a 
Crouch Dash Cancel for Crouch Dash Mixups purposes. Play this way, 
Kazuya IS a force to be reckoned with. Wave dash into WS+1,2 is very 
much abusable.... Just ask Jang. Drawbacks? The Twin Pistons just 
REFUSES to juggle big characters but if you are near you can still 
knock them off balance while they are recovering with a standing 1 and 
continue juggling them. Btw, forget about tagging out after WS+1,2 
(unles you are desperate to tag out safely ie low health bar) since it 
doesn't juggle your opponent very high, and you can't get much from the 
juggle anyways.

WS+2                    Demon Gut Punch         m           FS DSc JG
What went wrong??? I don't understand why each and every Kazuya FAQ 
authour so far says that the Demon Gut Punch is the most important move 
of Kazuya. Sure, it hits mid, comes out of crouching. Stuns your 
opponent for almost eternity, has high priority, recovers moderately, 
but expect to be smacked hard if this is blocked. It stuns both on CH 
and on Clean Hit, and does good damage.

BIG F***in' DEAL! Both kind of stuns ARE tag escapable! The DGP is by 
far the most overated move by most people. On CH, you will get a Double 
Over Stun which is much longer than the Fall over stun caused on a 
Clean hit, making damaging combos like the infamous DGP (CH), TGF,3 
possible. Do note that you can launch your opponent with a WGF 
regardless of whether it is a CH or Clean Hit stun. However, gone are 
the days where the DGP on CH would do BIG damage and the stun was 
unescapable. It is worth nothing though that the escape window for the 
DGP on CH is much smaller compared to that on Clean hit (think of of CH 
DGP as Jin's b,f+2 and Clean Hit DGP as Jin's b,f+2,1) That doesn't 
make the DGP a totally worthless move, it just is more risky with less 
guaranteed paybacks now in TTT.
 
This is basically Kaz's wildcard strategy, a last resort if you will = 
to get your opponent into eating the DGP on CH. I mean COME ON... if 
you hit this move its probably curtains for your opponent. The problem 
however with this move is plain and simple = tricking your opponent 
into eating the DGP on CH. I mean the DGP isn't the fastest move to 
perform from WS position so it is kinda hard to actually hit your 
opponent on CH. Which half-decent opponent would be stupid enough to 
eat wait for you to do a DGP after a d+1 jab? Of course Kazuya can do 
the DGP using a trick I dub as Instant Crouch (it may have other names, 
but I call it this) - Simply input d~db,N+2 or d~df,N+2 and he will do 
the DGP as if from a standing position. Think of this move as Paul's 
Phoenix Smasher on CH or Nina's Divine Cannon Combo - its hard to hit 
on CH in the first place, but if it does, your opponent will be in a 
major world of hurt. The situations where you can use this move however
are rather limited. First, and in a rare occasion, you should choose 
DGP over the Twin pistons if there is some distance between you and 
your opponent (say after d+3) and you know that the Twin Pistons will 
wiff (or get blocked). If your opponent is tagging out and you are in a
FC position, use the DGP since you most probably will get a stun (be it 
Clean hit or CH) If your opponent should escape the stun by tagging 
out, you can DGP him, but it is worth noting that your opponent can 
avoid it by cancelling the tag run in (u~ub)

After this move, you have some lovely follow ups which I will get to 
later in the Stun Juggle section. I'll repeat in case you haven't been 
paying attention all the while,the biggest draw back of this move is 
that your opponent can quickly tap 5 to tag out and thus cancel the 
stun, but if you look at his hand when he plays(which a good player 
should always try to do), you can prepare for the tag in and whack your 
opponent hard with the juggle starter or power move of your choice. 
Another catch though is that the player can push F to escape the stun 
(much like Jin's b,f+2,1 (ch) ) which makes this move even more 
useless. As far as the DGP usefulness though, it is good at beginner or 
intermediate level of play but almost useless against good players.

d/f+1                   Entrials Smash          m            HS
It looks like Bryan's df+2 punch... a kidney punch though slower and 
with more limited range I guess. Although players seldom use this move, 
I feel that it has been to often neglected (because of the other 
abusable moves like WS+1,2 which Kazuya has). Okay so whats so great 
about a move with limited range that takes 16 frames to hit? First off, 
Entrails smash is very safe even when blocked. Kazuya is only at -1 
frames disadvantage. Should it hit, Kazuya gets a nifty +3 frames 
advantage. The best part of it though is that Kazuya has a built in 
mini SSL when performing the entrails smash which helps a lot in custom 
strings when your opponent tries to barrage his way out of your pokes.
I usually use this move after my df+2 hits but not on CH and I know my 
opponent is trying to use a slow move to counter (Phoenix Smasher/ 
Deathfist anyone?). If this hits, your opponent will be slightly 
stunned giving you initiative but no free hit is guaranteed. Use this in 
a good string and your opponent will more than likely eat this. This 
move can be used in a juggle as a combo filler. You can attempt the oh-
so hard WGF, df+1, f+1, f+2 juggle demonstrated by Castel or opt for 
the easier, WGF, df+1, df+4,4... both doing good damage.

Chicken command: f+1+3 for Paul and Jin. All others cannot be chickened

Well well, what can I say. To say this move is slow and can be easily 
countered is true. But then since this is Tekken Tag and your opponent 
at some point of the game has to tag in (unless of course he plays to 
lose or your game is so pathetic) you can use this move to anticipate a 
tag and hit him hard. The follow up for this move (both the Mid kick 
and Hell sweep) can be easily interrupted by quick moves. So this move 
is bad? HELL NO! This move should be used if possible in your juggles.
What do you do if you tag your sorry opponent with a DGP? Finish him 
with a TGF,3 of course! This will make your opponent sorry for trying 
to hit you in the first place and he will fear the wrath of the DGP as 
it will take off LOADS of damage. The other instance in a juggle where 
this move can be used is after a Class 1 launcher (ie Yoshis 4~3, 
Hwoarangs f,N,d,df+4 etc ). The TGF is also a very good combo finisher
for WGF juggles. Please note however that the TGF after a WGF will only
connect on Big characters. (Kings too since they are considered Semi 
Big characters) Tis too bad that even when Namco decided to cripple 
Kazuya's game by not giving him an EWGF (and launch his opponent 
higher, they have decided to weaken him even more by preventing him to 
TGF his opponent after WGF by giving it a slooooow execution of 21 
frames. In comparison, even Jin can TGF his opponent after an (E)WGF. 
Not to mention, Heihachi can do it with ease since his TGF ducks lower 
than the other Mishimas.
If you are playing against a opponent with low intellect and low 
reactions, you can use this in your crouch dash guessing game, after 
doing loads of Hell sweeps and your opponent is too slow to react (but 
seriously though, even my Sis will be able to block this move as it 
comes out so slowly). Moreover, if the initial TGF is blocked, both the 
Mid kick (3) and Hell Sweep (4) follow up comes out so slowly you can 
be jabbed out of it. The Mid kick or Hell sweep Follow up *MAY* hit 
players who are too hasty in retaliating with a power move, but those 
are scrubs we are talking about, so there. I strongly advise against 
using the Hell Sweep follow up in all cases since it does slightly less 
damage when compared to the Mid Kick. Of course, you are welcome to try 
it for some variety. All in all a good move but only if you use it at 
the right place, and at the right time.
Pull it out at any other time, and I gurantee you, you WILL be the 
laughing stock. In short, Kazuya's TGF has decreased substantially in 
uses and as such can only be implented during specific situations of 
which there aren't many.

Chicken command : f+1+3 for All, except Wang's since it is considered a
                  lp reversal. 

So what if it hits mid and stuns as long as it hits.... if it hits. 
A lot of players like this move because it looks cool, and it does, 
since Kazuya takes a small crouching step forward and punch your 
opponent so you may be able to duck some high attacks. Sadly though, 
this move takes such a long time to come out that any opponent who is 
awake would be able to poke you out of it, or at least block this move.
Do NOT throw this move out just for the fun of it because wiffing is
NOT an option.

However in the event that this ACTUALLY connects, you can do a single 
Tsunami kick to kick your opponent into the air for a small juggle. If 
it does NOT connect... Hoo boy are you going to be sorry... this move 
recovers real bad and you will get juggled for all your effort. A good 
thing though is that this move does some solid damage and stuns even on
a whatever kind of hit. The only useful situation for the Glorious 
Demon Fist would be to punish wiffed slow-recovering attacks, but I 
feel that is better done with your WGF (comes out faster, easier 
juggles). 
Since Kazuya actually extends his hands quite a bit when performing the
Glodious Demon Fist, it is an excellent move (and the only REAL 
situation where it is useful) to catch tagging OUT opponents. However
using it in such a situation may result in hitting your opponent in 
the back so some of the juggles has to be changed (oh what the heck
just do WGF, df+4,4)
Another situation where this move may prove to be useful is when your 
opponent tags in. You can use the GDF to nail your defenseless opponent 
but do not forget that if he has tag slides or cross chops, you may get 
hit instead. Worse, if he should tag cancel, and he ends up blocking it
you are in deep shit.

Those who say that Kazuya should just use df+2 are correct in some 
sense but then f+1+2 was created for different purposes unlike df+2.
Besides for df+2 you need to have a clean and CH to land a stun, 
something f+1+2 can do on any hit.

Lately, I have been messing around with f+1+2 when I am playing with 
scrubs. It is an excellent move to catch people carelessly tagging out 
as I mentioned before. The damage is excellent pay off for the risk
you are taking AND the Juggles of it are rather flashy... i think.

This baby is what seperate Kaz from the other Mishimas (or Kazama if 
you'd like).  After doing f,N , Kaz does a small sidestep. After his 
mist step, Kaz can easily perform an instant WGF or Hell Sweep, or he 
can opt to go into his crouch dash. Performing moves from his mist step 
is quite useful especially if you can't perform a quick crouch dash. 
Have your opponent stunned with a DGP and can't seem to be able to 
connect with the normal TGF? Try doing the TGF after a Mist Step. 
Performing moves after Mist step allows the moved to be pulled out of 
no where especially where the Hell Sweep is concerned. Since the Wind 
God Fist has been tonned down to hit sM, your opponent will block low 
when he sees you starting to crouch dash... but what if he doesn't see 
you CD? What if you suddenly come out of a small sidestep with a quick 
Hell Sweep.  He will more than likely eat the Hell Sweeps and since 
Kaz's Hell Sweep trips on the first hit, you can easily follow up with 
another Sweep for okizeme purposes. But best of all, he doesn't 
necessarily have to do one of the follow up moves as he use his normal 
arsenal of moves (1,1 / 1,2 etc). Use this move in your strategy and 
I'm sure your opponent will be cursing you when you are done with him. 

I must stress that although the motion to perform the WGF from Mist 
step may seem faster, the WGF still comes out at the same speed because 
of the small SS caused by the Mist step, if you do the full Mist Step 
thingie. However,thanks to Reverend_C's input, if you do the WGF off 
Mist Step REALLY quick (f,N and immediately df+2, essentially doing WGF 
from Mist Step at the speed of an EWGF) Kazuya will cancel the Mist 
Step and go into his WGF, thus making it faster in terms of frames need 
to pull out a normal EWGF. Just for those frame freaks, an EWGF takes 
at least 15 frames to pull out (f,N,d each requires 1 frame each 
making that 4 frames and df+2 is the completion of the EWGF itself is 
11 frames making it 14) while the WGF off Mist Step Cancel is pulled 
off in 13 frames since Kazuya can skip the d command. When done this 
way, Kazuya's WGF will launch higher than usual like it would for an 
EWGF done the conventional way. Do remember that although the WGF can 
be technically done in 13 frames, I doubt that many can pull it off 
consistently unless you are a cyborg or something. 


f,n,d,df+2_f,n,df+2      Wind God Fist            sM         JG      

*DISCLAIMER* Whatever you may have read and believed, Kazuya does NOT 
             have an EWGF (and there is not EARTH Wind God Fist btw) so
             I don't wanna hear any more morons saying that they swear 
             on their sorry Chimpanzee's butt that they saw someone or
             something do an EWGF with Kazuya. I will only believe that
             Kazuya has an EWGF if I SEE thunder and HEAR lightning 
             when he does the WGF.

This is the heart and soul of EVERY Mishima. However, Namco created 
Kaz's WGF with different properties so that like all the characters
it would be unique. The price for the uniqueness comes at a price 
though which is somewhat a double edged sword.
               
Just in case you don't know how to do this move, it is  CD+2. Another 
vital move that is in every Mishima's strategy. Although the WGF has 
been tonned down so much so that it now hits special medium, it's use 
hasn't diminished one bit. Sure you don't have no crouch dashing game 
to fool your opponent with anymore, but I myself use this move whenever 
I see an opening. See your opponent winding up for a Deathfist? WGF 
immediately. You blocked Laws flip kick... WGF of course! This move 
comes out fast (and can be performed faster via Mist step cancel) and 
has superb recovery time so use it to counter or interrupt your 
opponent. 

Even though Kaz does not have much damage opportunity after popping 
your opponent up into the air, you should still use this move. Why? 
Remember this is Tekken Tag, and you can easily buffer in the tag 
button so that your partner tags in immediately to finish off the 
juggle. Unlike Old man Hei where all his strategies are based on 
popping your opponent up into the air with WGF, Kaz on the other hand 
is blessed with other moves like his DGP, Gut Punch and Twin Pistons 
(the latter playing a very important part in his strategy). So even as 
useful a move like a WGF can be, lets all remember that Kazuya has 
other options to fall back on. Also since the WGF is now non parriable 
and non-reversible, you should still NOT abuse this move because your 
opponent can still poke you out of it (d+1 is all that is needed) and 
when blocked, your opponent is guaranteed a throw if you do ANYTHING but 
duck. Rememer this is NOT heihachi's EWGF. 

Big Note, thanks to Bluu and all his experiments (I FINALLY got my very 
own PS2 ... YAY!) if the WGF is blocked at its maximum range, the WGF
will push your opponent too far away so that normal jabs can't reach 
you, and almost all the throws will wiff. Therefore even if there is
some recovery for a blocked WGF, since it pushes so far away you can't 
be hit, the WGF is practically invincible.
However, if you do WGF too close to your opponent, then opponents with
longer hands may be able to poke you. This is such the case with 
Heihachi who is guaranteed a 1,1,2 after blocking your WGF in close. 
Other characters like Law for example will be able to hit Kazuya with a 
quick 10 frame standing 4.

Speaking of WGF hitting sM, if you are those players who are still 
bitching around because Namco made the WGF hit sM instead of Mid (thus
crippling the CD mix up strategy) all I have have to say is you aren't 
playing Kazuya right. The main use of the WGF has to be to counter, and
for that purpose, it does it better second to none. The WGF ducks under
most high attacks, and even some mid hitting ones, comes out quick (13 
frames if you do it from Mist Step cancel) and has good priority which 
is second to none. If you use the WGF to counter youropponent and to 
punish wiffed /slow recovering attacks, I don't even care if the WGF 
hits high, mid, low, special mid, special whatever as Long as it hits. 
While some may say that by changing the WGF to sM Namco has weakened it 
a lot, I'd think otherwise.As someone in the Tekken Forum said (I'm 
sorry I forgot your name, so <insert name here>) the WGF is not the 
best launcher in the game, it's THE tekken launcher.

Kazuya's WGF from Mist step cancel will always come out at EWGF speed. 
However there is a major difference here. Coming out at EWGF speed 
doesn't mean that it will pop up as high or recover faster (as in 
Heihachi's case) after the WGF. Kaz's WGF will noticebly launch higher 
than usual if it is on Clean Hit, not if it is done EWGF style as 
previously mentioned. Sadly, Namco must have forgot (or refused)to add 
the Electric animation and block stun to Kazuya's EWGF which ultimately 
makes his WGF 3rd rank, only better than Angel and Devil... But then he 
has the WGF off Mist Step Cancel which is a dangerous weapon in it's 
own right. The only drawback from this move is that if it hits on CH, 
your opponent will be flipping in the air and some of the combos like 
WGF, 1,1,1,1, WGF cannot be done. Who cares about that when you can 
easily do WGF, 1,1, WGF, uf~4~3 for 70+ damage. Indeed, Kaz's CH WGF is 
what a Kazuya player should aim for since the combo is insanely easy 
not to mention damaging. For the more daring, they can try WGF, 1,1,1, 
uf~4~3 for 1.5 more damage. 
Now if only Namco would at a bit of Electric animation to Kazuya's WGF....

-Your WGF Lingo-
Those Korean's do like to come up with a lot of terms for each new 
technique they discover. Well here we are with some of them. Note that
Kazuya does not have EWGF.

a) DWGF 
Dash Wind God fist. Performed f,f,n,d,df+2. Nothing out of the world 
really. Kazuya just dashes a little before performing the WGF to give 
it more range. Used usually in combos, and sometimes is vital for a 
proper combo. e.g. df+2 (CH), WGF, WGF, DWGF. 

b) WWGF
Wave Wind God fist. This is when Kazuya performs the WGF at any point 
of the Wave dash, pulling the trigger. Also closely associated with it
is its cousin the LDWGF. 

c) MSWGF 
Mist Step Wind God Fist. Well...er ... this is a term I came up with 
(mannn.... I'm PROUD to create a new term LOL) This form of WGF is 
special and unique only to Kazuya since only he can perform a Mist
Step.

d) mWGF
Mist Step Cancel Wind God Fist. This is the fastest way to perform 
Kaz's WGF since you save a frame of input. Performed f,n~df+2 whereby
Kazuya cancels the Mist step animation. 

e) EWGF
Electric Wind God Fist. Wind God Fist with Electric animation that Jin
and Heihachi have. Juggles even on CH for Jin's case and certainly
launches higher than usual. A Move that many Kazuya players have seen
performed before, but none have actually achieved the feat. This is ONE 
move all Kazuya players dream he had.

f,n,d,DF+4,4           Hell Sweeps              L,L
Another bread and butter move passed down by his father. The Hellsweeps
of Kazuya is an important tool in his CD guessing game with Twin 
pistons. The special properties of Hell sweeps which will KND and place 
your opponent in PLD (face down, feet away) position is a valuable 
thing indeed and is used to set up various things like the OB trap for
example. Kazuya also has different properties for the 2nd kick of his
hell sweeps which I will discuss in detail further on. However, Kaz 
must have gotten lazy or something because he does two low sweeps and 
stops, while Hei has so many variations. However old man Hei must be 
getting real Old now since his first sweep doesn't trip, while Kaz does 
making it more useful since you can suddenly come out of Mist step and 
sweep you opponent. One thing to take note of is that the Hell Sweep
will trip as long as it hits on Clean hit. Just to note, Kazuya's Clean 
hit range for his Hell sweeps is larger than Jin's. At maximum range, 
the Hell sweep will limp your opponent. A good thing though is that the 
2nd hit of the Hell Sweep will ALWAYS trip no matter whether the first 
limped your opponent or totally wiffed. Completing the motion by 
performing both hell sweeps (f,n,d,df+4,4) will result in the first 
sweep always tripping even though he is at maximum range. However if 
you want the the 2nd hell sweep after the first one has limped you need 
to delay the it a bit after the first sweep. Remember even if the first 
hit only limped, the second hit IS guaranteed. Also, doing f,n,d,df+4,4 
nets you 24 points of damage but doing f,n,d,df+4 and following it up 
with d+3 does from 27-30 points of damage. Well the 30 points depends
on whether you activate the combo counter. If you do d+3 quickly (and
activate the combo counter) the d+3 (or f,n,d,df+3) counts as a combo 
and as such takes only a percentage of the d+3 damage (since in a combo
each subsequent hit reduces in damage from its base damage) If however
you delay the low kick a bit, then it doesn't count as a combo (even 
though d+3 IS guaranteed) and the damage of the low kick is taken as the
base damage and therefore the damage is 27 points. If you trip your 
opponent and the distance between him is rather large such that d+3 
will wiff, then do f,n,d,df+3 (this is an unofficial move where Kazuya 
CD's into his d+3) Also the delayed f,n,d,df+3 can aslo be used for
OB trap. Any well time hit on a rising KND opponent will result in your
opponent being backturned. Well refer to OB trap section for more.
This combo is risky to say the least and one might want to opt for the 
safer 24 points guaranteed knockdown Hell sweeps, but just keep in mind 
that Kazuya's Clean hit range is again far greater than Jin's. However 
the introduction of sweep stagger in Tekken Tag means 
that if you are near and your opponent blocks your hell sweep, you will 
staggera bit giving him the chance to clock you. Also the Hell sweep is 
an ideal okizeme tool which I will further discuss later on in the 
"Okizeme" Section.
Btw, you can Juggle off a hell sweep. However since the recovery time
is a bit different, you can only juggle off a Hell sweep if: 
a) your first hit just limped your opponent and the second hit trips
   them
b) you wiff your first hit but the second hit trips them.

The recovery time will be oh so much faster , so much so that you can
connect with another two hell sweeps or juggle with a WGF, much in the
same vein as Heihachi could in Tekken 3 after a Hell sweep. Just for
the record, f,n,d,df+4(limp),4, WGF, df+4,4 IS a true combo for those 
who doubt it isn't.
It is so unfortunate that the properties of Kazuya's Hell sweep is such
that on CH it need not necessarily trip your opponent. Kazuya HAS to be
in Clean Hit range in order that his Hell sweep trips his opponent CH 
or not. Also even when performed EWGF style, Kazuya's Hell sweep does
not necessarily trip. Arghh!!!
Lastly, when whiffed, the first sweep recovers longer than the second 
sweep.

Some Tips from Bluu:
Generally a Kaz player must do his hell sweeps fast (don't buffer) and 
always complete the motion. Also if you REALLY know your spacing, try 
to do your sweeps at maximum distance. Why? Because when it is blocked 
you are pretty much safe from from things such as Hopkicks, etc.
Another thing is if you want electricity from a Hell sweep, get it on 
CH (or Netsu powerup)

df+2                    Gut Punch               m            JG CFSc
In any situation that you would use the Glorious Demon Fist, the
standing df+2 Gut Punch would almost always be a better option. First 
it can be initiated from standing position (so you won't need to be in 
the crouched person first of all) and more importantly it doesn't take 
as long as the Glorious Demon Fist to wind up.  

Although the Gut punch looks the similar as its cousin the DGP (meaning 
he crouches a lil bit and then punches your opponent), the stun 
animation is not as long. Moreover, the Gut Punch will ONLY stun if it 
hits on a clean hit AS WELL AS CH. However, this crumple fall stun can 
NOT be tag escaped so you can get a guaranteed juggle in, and even if 
you don't get it to hit on CH, your   For comparisons sake, the Gut 
Punch comes out a tad faster than the Demon Gut Punch (14 frames for 
the Gut Punch vs 16 frames for the Demon Gut Punch). However it 
recovers a frame slower than the Demon Gut Punch if blocked so you know 
you are going to get a good beating if your opponent blocks it. Thanks 
to 7ronko, the block disadvantage of the df+2 depends on the distance 
you get blocked. If it gets blocked at a short distance, it causes a 
small guard stun to your opponent, so the the disadvantage is minimal 
and there is no guaranteed hits possible. However, if it is blocked at a 
long distance, it does not cause guard stun, so the block disadvantage 
is indeed 14 frames. Drawbacks and advantages though, it is for these 
reasons that I feel the standing Gut Punch is way much more effective 
and useful than its cousin, the Demon Gut Punch.

The standing gut punch proves its use in custom strings since it is 
a solid mid hitting attack which does crap loads of damage on a CH.
Simple strings such as 1,2, df+2 are ideal since your opponent would
most likely duck in anticipation of the stature kick. Once your 
opponent wises up and starts blocking high, you can throw him (or at 
least hit him with a stature kick). Will get to this later in my Custom 
Strings section.
This move is also valuable when your opponent tags in with a move and 
you are in a standing position ready to hit him. Usually I'd suggest 
you use the WGF, however you can get up to like 47 points of damage if 
the Standing gut hits both on CH and Clean hit, the damage itself alone 
shadows most of the WGF juggles. Lets face it, Kazuya's WGF juggles 
can't do as much damage as you'd like. Moreover, this move, as I have 
stated earlier is 14 frames, and unless you are someone who can pull 
off a 14 frame WGF each and everytime, the df+2 should be more 
reliable.

This is also a good move for beginners and players who can't seem to do 
those 'oh-so-hard' WS moves, thus not being able to do Kazuya's WS+1,2. 
*you'd better learn to do them quick though as WS+1,2 is one of 
Kazuya's most important moves* .

Apparently while I was fooling around in the cade the other day with 
Kazuya I accidently hit my opponent with a df+2 Gut Punch on CH + Clean
Hit while trying to do a Mist-Step Cancel WGF (henceforth referred to
as mWGF) Anyways, after that I tried another mWGF and to my amazement
it does launch. Anyways thanks to info from Kazuya Kazama, who 
confirmed this, you have absolutely 0 slop factor when trying to launch
your opponent after a CH df+2. You have exactly 13 goddamn frames to 
launch them and if you are slow by just ONE damn frame. Yes that means
any mistake and your opponent will be flying away. This really makes 
Jin's b,f+2(CH), EWGF and Kazuya's WS+2(CH), WGF look extremely easy
in comparison. The trick is to initiate the motion for the mWGF the 
moment you see your opponents knees hit the ground or when Kazuya's
right arm goes behind his left. To be honest, launching with a mWGF
involves a lot of risk and if you are really desperate on doing damage 
then stick with b+1+4 or u+(4),4,4,4. However, even if you accidently
do df+2 or do not launch with WGF after the df+2 stun, the damage isn't
really that bad anyways.


2,2                     Demon Back Hand         h,h
While the Demon Slayer has its few uses in combos, the Demon Backhand, 
I'm afraid is worse. The 1,2 of the Demon Slayer gains a few plus 
points since it has forward momentum, however, if you imagine the last
2 hits of the Demon slayer which comes out sooooo slowly and is sooooo
telegraphed you'd know why this is the worst move in Kazuya's 
repretoire... whoops... make that second worst.. the worst move has to 
be the standing backhand (b+2) 

b+2                     Single Joke Back Hand   hits nothing    rubbish
Well this move is.... sadly the worst move in Kazuya's repertoire. I 
know that I have a policy of not rating moves but argh.... I'll break 
that policy just once and tell you this - stay FAR FAR away from this 
move if you have any hope or doing well against good competition.  

f+2                     Soul Thrust             m            GB GS KNDc
This move when hit on a counter will put your opponent in the face up, 
head away knocked down position. Looks like Jin's f,f+2, but slower and 
not so much range (Kazuya looks like he is doing a standing version of 
his Tummy Rush) . I myself don't use this move often and usually only
in combos..... but then I'd rather tag in my partner to do the dirty work.
You see the main problem with this move is its slow, relatively 
lack of range and will only KND your opponent if it hits on CH. It 
isn't without its pros though. If this move hits, Kazuya gains frame 
advantage (+8 frames) which is again very useful to set up his CD 
mixups. 
You CAN use this in custom strings, something like :
f,f,1,1, d+1, WS+4, f,f,1,1 df+1, f+2
This move can be useful if used correctly, but because Kazuya has other
much better moves, this move seems pretty weak.

f,f+3                   Split Axe Kick          m
Hey... I'm slow. I hit mid and I knockdown. Actually though, I think 
this move is totally worthless. At least when Jin uses this move (and 
if it can actually connect) he can juggle with the White Heron Combo.
I mean gosh... this move is so slow, your opponent could nail you cold 
without you knowing what hit you. Wait, you can actually do some 
juggles after the knockdown from this move, but MAN its hard and you'd 
probably do yourself a favour by not using this in the first place. 
Note that like all f,f moves you can do it off a CD cancel.

f,f,f_WR+3              Leaping Slash Kick      m            GB
The same Leaping Slash Kick that everyone has.  Use it when you run at
your opponent and they're moving, but it's not long enough for should-
er ram.  If blocked, it'll stun them long enough to leave Kazuya safe.
But if you actually get to use this move, I'd rather use the running 
slide or the shoulder ram.

f+4                     Axe Kick                m            GB KS
If your opponent blocks this kick, he will be stunned and stagger, 
giving you the slight initiative. There are however no sure follow ups 
should your opponent block it. However the frame advantage you have is 
ideal to set up Kazuya's CD mix ups. I'd like to stress on the key word 
here "FRAME ADVANTAGE". With most of the other characters being able to 
Outpoke Kazuya with their 8 frame jabs, Kazuya needs frame advantage 
and space if he is to set up his CD mixups. This is where f+4 comes in 
handy since it gives you a hefty +11 frames advantage!!!

I have to admit that I have started using this move quite a bit and 
found it to be an excellent move if not for its rather poor range and 
slow execution. The poor range can be easily overcome by performing the 
Axe Kick out of CD. However, you have to performing it by pressing 
f,n,d,df,f,f,F+4, instead of f,n,d,df,f,f+4. As demonstrated by 
Castel's Juggle video (Kazuya Act 2), the Axe Kick can be used to stun 
crouching opponents (good for those custom strings when you have 
trained your opponent to duck high attacks) for a meaty juggle....ideal 
in your custom strings....getting the WGF however is  easier than you 
think it is. (okay its hard but with a bit of practise it isn't if you 
compare that to the WGF after CH df+2). 

A player may ask... who would be so stupid to eat a 20 frame (well if 
I'm not mistaken its 20 frames) kick while ducking even in custom 
strings? Yes they are right in the sense, but I use f+4 a lot in 
Kazuya's Okizeme game. OKIZEME GAME? Yep! After an attack which grounds 
your oppoenent (say Hell sweep) you can SSL off axis around your 
opponent and force him to guess what to do next. If he even thinks 
about attacking you, WGF him for a CH and 70+ points juggle. If he gets 
up here is where the fun begins. You should usually use f+4 a lot since 
even he blocks it you get frame advantage. Should your opponent rise 
crouching well..... you know what to do next... STUN, WGF juggle. Mix 
this up with Hell sweeps and throws to prevent from being too 
predictable.

But what if it hits your opponent on CH. Your opponent will be grounded 
in what could possibly have been a CH WGF juggle for 70+ points. Yes 
you are right here...BUT grounding your opponent gives you a HUGE 
advantage to set up your next attack, namely WD. Think of the 
potential. CH f+4, and a WGF,4 juggle does more than a CH WGF juggle 
not to mention you can rinse and repeat your WD'ing antics.

I made the stupid mistake of confusing the Axe kick with the Rising 
Kick (first part of Tsunami kicks) If you are having trouble pulling 
out f+4 consistently try f~4 instead.

WS_df_f,n,d,df+4        Rising Kick             m
  <4                    Tsunami Kick            m
Another trademark Mishima move, and a good one too. Kazuya can do this 
move by tapping df much like Jin can but he can't initiate it using QCT 
like Heihachi. Some say that he won't be able to gain more forward 
momentum, but you can easily do so by CD and doing the Tsunami Kick.
The First tsunami Kick is the most important as it can be used to lift 
your opponent who is on the ground for a juggle (assuming they are big
or if your opponent moves even a bit) It is also used in Okizeme. After 
a generic low parry (df) a df+4,4 is pretty much guaranteed and is, if 
I'm not mistaken, the most damaging, guaranteed follow up after a low 
parry for Kazuya. Lastly the Rising Kick has forward momentum and is 
useful in custom strings since it has very low recovery time. Moreover 
the second hit is delayable to try to sucker your opponent into eating 
the damn thing. A small good news for those Kaz players who can't get 
over the fact that the CD mix up has been killed because of Kaz's (and 
Hei's and Devil's) WGF has been made sM will be slightly joyed to know 
that you can mix up Kazuya's Tsunami Kicks with his Hell Sweeps. But 
don't go hoping that you will catch many experts with this tactic as 
the Hell Sweeps are highly telegraphed. Remember if the first Kick hits 
the second is guaranteed. Oh and did I forget to mention that it is 
useful in juggles? The initial Rising Kick is also very useful for OB 
trap. However this tactic is less useful than that of Jin. When your 
opponent is on the ground (most likely from a Hell sweep) you can try a 
WS+4 and wiff it (assuming your opponent does not move) Your opponent 
will most likely try to rise up and attack you of which you immediately 
d+1 him. d+1 will interrupt any rising attack that they have and 
backturn them guranteeing you a subsequent free hit. For Jin that would 
be WS+2 and juggle but for Kazuya his options are limited (WS+2 or WS+
1,2 which wiffs most of the time) This tactic is very potent when 
combined with wavedash to mask the intentional df+4 wiff and works at 
higher level of play.

u_uf+4,4,4,4             Spinning Demon          h,L,L,h      BS
So the guy who challenged you just pick Eddy Gordo and is now mashing 
as hard as possible on the controls? Use this move. This will kill him 
as Kaz will jump into the air, do a spinning kick, land and do 2 hell 
sweeps before ending with a roundhouse kick. The sweeps will be what 
usually kills them, and since this has good tracking ability, you won't 
need to worry about those Gordo's spinning all around the arena. At a 
higher level of play though, this move is practically useless. First 
the kicks can be low parried by anyone (given the inclusion of the 
universal low parry) which leaves you at a disadvantage. Secondly if 
the sweeps are blocked, the second sweep will leave you staggered, and 
you will be beaten up like hell. It has its uses though as it can be 
done after a Gut punch (df+2) on CH or a Glorious Demon Fist (f+1+2) 
for an easy, damaging combo (you have to use the u+4,4,4,4 version), 
but hey, I'd rather see a perfectly timed b+1+4 unblockable hit. The 
Spinning Demon is the most ideal follow up after a Glorious Demon Fist 
has connected since most of the GDF juggles are hard and do not do as 
much damage. Cheesy though, but who cares... its the damage that 
matters!

4~3                     Demon Scissors          M  
Chicken command: This move CANNOT be chickened
          
Since the addition of Quick Recover in Tekken 2, the Demon Scissors use 
has been severely weakened to the point of uselessness. What more, 
Kazuya WILL take damage if the Demon Scissors wiff. However, I do not 
think that this move is completely worthless since Kazuya's WGF on CH 
will cause your opponent to flip over thus guranteeing a free okizeme 
hit. Therefore after a WGF (CH) 1, 1, 1, WGF you can add a 4~3 Demon 
Scissors for good measures since your opponent will not be able to 
quick recover. Another tip is to do uf,4~3 since Kazuya will initiate 
the Demon Scissors faster (vital in some cases for the 4~3 to connect 
if your opponent is lying on the ground before he recovers and rolls 
away.) If you are facing Eddy mashers who start those slippery kick
nonsense from a far, use the Demon scissors to knock them out of their
monkey business before they can annoy you anymore.

db+4                    Stature Kick            l
An average move, one you should throw sparringly during your mixup of 
strings. The kick is hard to see coming and your opponent will most 
likely eat it. The damage however is rather low but can you really 
blame it for being such an deceptive move? Kazuya feints a high kick 
but instead attacks low - an ideal move for ticking life away. Just 
remember that at the end of the round every sliver of damage counts, 
PLUS you get a +5 frame advantage to continue on with your strings. The 
only drawback of this move is that if your opponent is somehow sees it 
coming and blocks it (which will happen VERY often at a high level of 
play), you will be in trouble, since it has a bad recovery (9 frames, 
which is enough to get you jabbed). However this move will almost 
always land against scrubby or intermediate opponents. Landing this 
move against advanced players though is another story. As Chinky Eye 
mentioned in the forum - this move involves too much risks with too 
little paybacks. Other than that this is one of Kazuya's more useful 
poking attack bar bad controls that is. A thing worth noting, the 
stature Kick is 20 frames which is on the slow side, and what more you 
will be standing, so if your opponent KNOWS you are going to stature 
Kick him, an EWGF will be your reply. Use this moderately, or you'd be 
sorry.


Unblockables
-------------

Command                 Name                    

b+1+4              Lightning God Fist
Chicken Command: f+1+3 for Paul, f+2+4 for Jin. All others cannot be 
                 chickened.

Usually, unblockables are so damn useless except for a few. Kazuya's 
Lightning God Fist is among the few exceptions. This move comes out 
real fast for an unblockable and does good damage (40%). You can use 
this move in combos after a Class 1 launcher or during a stun combo. 
You can connect with this after a Demon Gut Punch if you can't seem to 
be able to pull off the TGF fast enough. This move can also connect 
after a df+2 and f+1+2 stun though that is much MUCH harder. Lastly, 
you can pull this move out at random because even good players freeze 
when seeing an unblockable. Just make sure that you don't over use this 
move. I forgot to state this but b+1+4 will go underneath high attacks
and most mid attacks, so use this if your opponent is getting too 1,1 
happy or happily pulling Deathfist after Deathfist.

B+1+4              Lightning Screw God Fist
Chicken Command: f+1+3 for Paul, f+2+4 for Jin. All others cannot be
                 chickened.

Well if the Lightning Screw God Fist is useful, well this move is 
really so useless I can't think of anyone getting hit with this. Even 
Eddy Gordo mashers will kick you out of the wind up before you can 
actually hit them. If you can connect this move at a consistent basis 
on an average tekken player, consider yourself a master. Hey, you can 
perform this move when anticipating your opponent tagging out, but 
chances are that your opponent will tag slide/ cross chop you out of it 
before you can hit. However in a tight battle where you know you have 
lost it wouldn't be so bad to pull this out since even GOOD players 
freeze at the sight of an unblockable and with some luck you may be 
ablt to hit him with this and win the round. Just look at Valle vs 
Nappi 2 in the world tourneys. If it ever connects, even on normal hit 
he is in a major world of hurt.. and on CH... LOL. However, there are
a few instance where this move is guaranteed - to hit your opponent 
after a f+1+2. If your opponent was a big opponent, then he will be 
taking some massive damage. But if he isn't you will wiff him and get 
up ready to be backthrown/ juggled or literally get your ass kicked 
around. Also in PS2 TTT, Kazuya can get B+1+4 on normal sized 
characters after Angel's SS+2.


*************************
Pre-canned 10 Hit Strings
*************************

I don't understand why people STILL practise the 'religion' of 10 Hit 
combos. I don't understand why after parrying their 10 hit string on 
the 9th Hit for the 10th time they STILL come at me with the same 10 
Hit string. Hmm... in my opinion 10 hit strings are useful only against 
the CPU since the CPU will fall for the last few hits of the 10 Hit 
string. Don't ask me why but even on Ultra Hard (and cheesy) setting, 
the CPU still falls for certain 10 Hit strings (like Julia's for 
example) However against good players , I will never ever allow a 10 
hit string to go unpunish. Whether its a simple parry or a perfectly 
timed Demon Gut Punch on CH, I will make my opponent pay.

f,f,N+2,1,2,2,,3,4,4,2,        Ten string
f,f,N+2,1,2,2,3,4,4,3,2,1      Ten string
f,f+N+2,1,4,4,2,4,3,2,1        Nine string

Anyways back to Kazuya's 10 Hit string. They actually look kinda cool 
but since the first 4 hits of his 10 hit string hits high a d+1, d+3 
etc will easily poke you out of the act. However if your opponent is 
stupid enough to allow the whole combo to hit, then you do get to see 
some very flashy unblockable finish.
His 9 string on the other hand has 2 high hits so at least there is a 
better chance of completion against scrubs (but then I'd parry the Low 
hit) Also if you some how manage to complete it, the 9th hit will stun 
your opponent giving you the advantage to do something like go buy your 
opponent a bus ticket to go home.

Protip submited by Vengetta_X: An expert knows ALL the 10 hit combos.

Hmmm... and 'excellent' tip if I ever saw one. So all those Kazuya 
experts don't call yourself experts just yet until you learn your
10 hit combos. You MUST use it in battles because they are the true
mark of an expert. ROTFL

.......  HOWEVER ......

There is a glitch with Kazuya's 10 Hit combo in which you can teleport 
during the 5th hit. !!! TELEPORT !!! Yep, here is the Kazuya Teleport 
Glitch trick submitted by "Puzzykatz". The below article of Kazuya's 
Crouching Teleport Glitch is all written by him and is in its original 
form, unaltered. Small Changes (addition of N in f,f,N+2,1... which 
were deemed necessary) was made without altering the original meaning 
of the text. Indication is made when I have made a comment on a certain 
point. All credit goes out to him for the text and the discovery of 
this glitch. 

Kazuya's crouching teleport glitch
**********************************

What it is?
-----------
It is a glitch where Kazuya gets teleported forward crouching, while 
recovering from his f,f,N+2,1,4,4,2 5-string (iLuvMomo: which is part 
of his 10 string) This Glitch also works with Jin's f,f,N+2,1,4,4,2 
5-string.

How was it found?
-----------------
I was reading jjt and KOFTEKKEN's Advanced Technique document, where 
they mentioned that the 5 string has an "odd property" because it 
"recovers crouching". However I believe they did not find out you can 
teleport after it. I experimented with the string and accidentally 
found the glitch.

What are the properties of the 5-string?
----------------------------------------
f,f,N+2,1,4,4,2 is a h,h,m,m,l string. The first 4 hits are so fast 
that when they block the first 2 hits standing, they will still block 
the 4,4 standing even if they hold down. However if they duck f,f,N+2,1 
they will continue to duck expecting 1,2,2 or 1,2,4 they WILL get hit 
by 4,4. Unfortunately although the first 4 hits are fast, they are not 
a true combo.

The 5th hit is a low hit which comes out after a slow delay. It's 
basically the generic d+2 that everyone has, except this one his low 
instead of special mid. Yes, it can be low parried, but since it is a 
punch, nothing is guaranteed although you will be at a slight 
disadvantage.

How to perform the teleport?
----------------------------
Simply do f,f,N+2,1,D+4,4,2. In other words, after the first two 
punches, hold DOWN and continue with 4,4,2. You will see after the 
punch, Kazuya will be transported forward a short distance, still 
crouching.

How is the teleport useful?
---------------------------
f,f,N+2,1,4,4,2 recovers way far away from your opponent, too far for a 
throw, twin piston, etc. to connect. However the teleport will bring 
you closer, close enough for those attacks to make contact with your 
opponent (unless they moved).

The recovery of the 5 string looks vulnerable, and it's obvious that it 
recovers crouching. Kazuya can not normally retaliate from that 
position and distance, so your opponent may not be prepared to block 
your surprise attack.

What can you do after the teleport? 
-----------------------------------
(poke)   d+1_d+4 => f,f,N+2,1,D+4,4,2, d+1_d+4
(throw)  1+3_2+4 => f,f,N+2,1,D+4,4,2, 1+3_2+4
(juggle) WS+1,2  => f,f,N+2,1,D+4,4,2, WS+1,2
(bait)   WS+4    => f,f,N+2,1,D+4,4,2, WS+4
(stun)   WS+2    => f,f,N+2,1,D+4,4,2, WS+2
(tackle) FC,1+2  => f,f,N+2,1,D+4,4,2, FC,1+2 <iLuvMomo>


..... hmmmm.... so the 5 string of Kazuya isn't so bad after all (if 
your opponent isn't expecting it to come that is) and certainly makes 
his strings a little more useful than I gave it credit for.



********
Movement
********

This is something that I realize is sorely lacking from most Tekken 
players. Most players just do a move, stand there and block and attack 
again. Sure against beginners and average players this will work out 
fine. However , if you are to play it as a 2D game in a 3D world, I'm 
sure you are going to get a serious trashing against good opponents. DO 
NOT ADOPT THE MENTALITY OF "HIT, BLOCK, HIT". Think of this as a boxing 
match. You don't punch your opponent and wait for him to react and 
punch you back right? Come on, you have so many options available to 
you. Namco didn't just put the Sidestep feature into the game for no 
reason, did they? Besides, you have the CD which gives you a bigger 
advantage. By moving around a lot, your opponents chances of hitting 
you and landing that major butt-kicking juggle starter is lower. 
Moreover, he may wiff and therefore allow you the chance to counter 
attack him. There are occasions when blocking will be more of a 
disadvantage to you than sidestepping. The best example is Bryan's 
b+1~5 which causes such a long guardstun that he is guaranteed at least 
a 1,2 or 1~4. In such a case, blocking would be very much hazardous 
than sidestepping. Besides if you sidestep you can retaliate with a WGF 
of your own since he will be busy recovering from a wiffed move.

Sidestepping
------------

I don't think I need to teach you how to sidestep, but I wish to 
emphasize how important it is to sidestep. Try to incorporate 
sidestepping in your game step by step (no pun intended). At first you 
may find it really hard to successfully sidestep attacks but with 
practise you will be able to sidestep most moves easily. You should 
also include side stepping in your movement for example :-

f,f,N,SSD, b,b,N, SSU, f,f etc

By simply moving around you create confusion for your enemy as he will 
have a harder time anticipating when to attack you since his attacks 
will miss more often than not. For Kaz, he can be more confusing as he 
can add his Wave Steps and Mist step into his sidestep movement 
(although this is hard)... and come out of it with a WGF or Hell Sweep.

Sure Kazuya doesn't have good moves that come out of his SS unlike Jin, 
Devil, Changs etc. , but that doesn't mean that he shouldn't sidestep. 
Learn how to do a WS+2 and WS+1,2 out from a SS and you'd be surprised 
how many times you will be able to catch your opponent on CH with the 
DGP. Lets also not forget your WGF. You may go for a sidethrow from 
your sidestep but side throws are easily broken by good players.

To succesfully sidestep opponent's moves, sidestep in the direction the
move of which he is pulling off. For instance if he is pulling off a 
right punch, you would sidestep to your right (your opponents left) Of 
course this is just a general formula. Somemoves track well and some 
don't. Take Jin for example. EWGF doesn't track well while f,f+2 
Demon's Paw has good tracking. EWGF can be sidestepped in both 
directions rather easily, but sidestepping to the left (your opponents 
right) of f,f+2 is a tad risky because of its tracking. Not to say that 
it is not impossible though, with perfect timing, you can sidestep 
Jin's f,f+2 to both sides, a technique which RedKing mentions in his 
Jin Compendium as interrupted sidestepping. Even if you aren't 
interested in playing Jin, do read his FAQ because his sidestep section 
is useful for all characters, not only Jin alone.
Succesfully sidestepping an opponent's attack is more of an art which
you will slowly master. Do not give up when, at first you often get hit
even when trying to side step your opponent's move. Another thing to
remember is that some moves have really good tracking and it will hit
you unless you sidestep at the very last second. Other moves have
good radius (example Yoshi's standing 4) and will hit you if you
sidestep too early.

*small note* 
A lot of people say its pretty hard to do a SS into a mist step of the 
same direction. However I can do it pretty consistenly alright (not 
100% as I would like though) Trick is to SS, pause a slight second and
then tap f,N. Hey, anyone reading this, please try this and lemme know
if this works or not. =) 

On the other hand, you can do it the other way, do Mist step and then
double sidestep. A triple sidestep is not really recommended because
Kazuya's Mist step sidestep depends on his frame and also because the
distance of his Mist step Sidestep is pretty small unlike Bob's triple
Sidestep.

Wave Dashing
------------

I actually used this move first before reading any of the Kazuya FAQs 
but I will not take any credit away from whoever first discovered it. 
The idea of the Wave dash is to cancel the CD by inputting f which is 
also the start of another CD command, hence, a continous chain of 
CD'es. In short :-

f,N,d,df,n~f,N,d,df,n~f,N,d,df,n~f and so on

or

f,N,d,df,f~f,n,d,df~f,n,d,df~f,n,d,df~f and so on.

What makes this so dangerous is that you can pull the trigger from the 
Wave dash any times, namely you can come out from it with a WGF,Demon 
Gut Punch or Twin Pistons. To come out of a CD with a WS move, just 
press b + Button(s) from the CD. Sure it is hard to perform at first, 
but with a lil practice, your CD game will be feared (as you can now 
mix up the Hell sweeps with the Twin Pistons or Demon Gut Punch - not 
recommended though). So who was it that said that the Mishima's CD 
strategy was completely killed now that the WGF hits sM? Also from the 
CD, you can buffer a stonehead throw (f,N,d,df,f+1+2) The Wave dash 
will become extremely useful if you incorporate sidesteps and 
backdashes into it.... even Mist steps as you can pull a Hell Sweep out 
of no where (how many times have I said this? ) 
However useful the Wave dash can be, it does not have 'ABUSE' written 
all over it. My point is, don't just simply wave dash. Do NOT simply 
Wave Dash in to close down distance on your opponent, because more than 
likely, you will get a nice hopkick for all your trouble, and you know 
what happens after a hopkick *especially* with Julia. I'm not saying 
that you CAN't use it to close distance, but use it sparringly and as I 
said before, mix it with Sidesteps, backdashes etc. 

The most effective (and safest) use of Wave dashing is when your 
opponent is down to apply pressure on them. With your opponent on the 
floor, and you continuously dashing towards him, he will be spoilt for
choice whether to roll on the ground or get up and attack. Either way, 
it is dangerous for him since if he gets up with a kick, you can WGF 
for a juggle. If he decides to roll, you can kick him back to the 
ground, wash rinse and repeat. IMO, the Wave dash is one of the most 
dangerous Okizeme tool when used right since your opponent could be 
lying on the ground till he is dead or time expires. 

*note* for the above methods discussed above, the first one 
       f,n,d,df~n~f definitely works, but there should be at least
       an 8 second pause for the neutral command. For that reason it is
       sometimes easier to do the second version because if you have
       quick hands, that means you can do more Wave Dashes per sec.
       Thanks to MSG (you have finally posted something useful on 
       Zaibatsu) for this small info. Also instead of doing something 
       like f,n,d,df,f~f,n,d,df,f~f you can substitute the f~f with
       b~f, db~f etc. Try b~f.....

... And All the Other Dashes
----------------------------

Wave dashin' wave dashin' and the next thing you know those Koreans 
come up with another 3216841320684 new Dashes. Ah well, Wave dashing is 
the core of which has spawned many variants which I will just touch on 
briefly.

a) Slow Wavedashing
This is the wavedashing cancelled slowly usually to prolong each crouch 
dash. The reason is to cover more ground quickly. This is seldom used 
since you are very vulnerable during the CD motion. Players opt for the 
Fast Wave dash and even Light dash. 
Measure - 2-3 CD's a second

b) Fast Wavedash
The fast version of the Wavedash. The fast wave dash is very potent 
since it allows the player to travel across the screen at a relatively 
fast pace, though a smaller distance is covered per dash. However, more 
CD's also means more points for WGF/Hellsweeps/iWS moves. Most Kazuya 
players only reach the Fast Wavedash stage.
Measure - 4-5 CD's a second

c) Light Dashing
Basically this is WAVE DASHING. However, the speed of each CD cancelled 
to another is that of an EWGF, constantly. The distance covered by each 
CD is very small and the character can be seen bobbing along. LD is the 
most potent form of WD since the player can cancel at any time to EWGF 
(well Kazuya doesn't have EWGF so WGF at EWGF speed), Hell sweeps and 
iWS moves. The Light dash is the most feared weapon of the Mishimas.
Measure - 6+ CD's a second

d) Snake Dash
The Snake dash is another variant of the Wave/Light dash. The Player 
cancels the CD into a SS and a SS into a CD, weaving about like a snake. 
It is notated as such:-

f,n,d,df,f, SS, f,n,d,d,df,f, SS, f,n,d,df,f, etc.

Note that the player can choose to do 2 or more CD's and then SS or 
even use another varitn where he incoporates Mist steps into his SS. 
This is called the.....

e) Box Step. 
Funny names they gives it. The Box step need not necessarily incoporate 
CD/WD into it but usually the players do. This is when Kazuya Mist 
steps and cancel it into a SS. From there he can go into a CD/WD or 
Mist step again. If done correctly Kazuya's legs will look really 
quirky and be like floating about. Not much use, but due to the random
nature of Mist step which is controlled by the frames, your opponent is
equally baffled as you as to which direction you will Mist step in. 
Another variant of the Box Step (Actually THIS is the real box step) is 
f,n,f,n,f,n etc but the randomness of the Mist step makes it very 
unpredictable. Looks real funny though but you really need good timing 
for this.


CD Cancel into WS+1,2
---------------------
Ever since this FAQ was released, I have always been asked "How come I 
can't get the WS+1,2 twin pistons out of CD cancel consistently?" Okay
before I go into further detail, for those who don't know what I am 
talking about, CD cancel into WS+1,2 is basically when you do a CD and
cancel the CD animation. During certain frames of the animations, you 
should be rising from Crouched position and would be able to do WS+1,2 
properly. It can also be called as CD into instant WS+1,2 if you know
what I mean. 
This is probably going to be Kazuya's main attacking tool along with 
with his hell sweeps since it offers him the opportunity for CD mixups.
Okay enough blabbering. So how do I do the CD cancel into WS+1,2 you 
ask? Well there are two methods

1) f,n,d,df~b+1,2 _ f,n,d,df~db+1,2
2) f,n,d,df~db,b+1,2

There are significance of the two methods. The first method being more
illusive as the WS+1,2 comes out from the CD in one smooth motion. If
done correctly, there should be no transition time (aka no tell tale
signs which screams "I'm going to WS+1,2 you). On the other hand
the second method is much like Devil's CD cancel into standing twin
pistons df+1,2 as in it can be seen much easily. No it does not look
the same but the fact that there is a short lag time (you can see 
Kazuya crouching for a brief moment) gives away the fact that you are
going to do Twin pistons. Therefore, I would suggest using the first
method and only do the 2nd method after 10 years of trying without 
success. Bewarned though, the first method is very much harder and most
of the time you will either do it too fast (you will do 1,2 instead) or
too slow (in which case TGF will come out)
Anyways for those who have trouble pulling it off consistently (and I 
know there are many) here is a small tip for you. When doing a CD 
cancel (or EWGF for that matter) its not really necessary to push the 
joystick all the way to the edge. What I mean is all you need is a 
slight tap and the computer will register the command already. If you
push the joystick all the way in a given direction, 9 out of 10 times
you will fail to do the CD Cancel and end up doing TGF.
And for those who always keep getting 1,2, my advice is to master your
iWS+1,2 first because that will help you. You already got the timing
for the f,n,d,df~db motion just that you are pressing 1,2 at the wrong
time. 

I hope this small info should be of great help for Kazuya players out 
there who wish to master one of his most difficult techniques. Remember
practise is the key to success. Before you get all fustrated out though
I'd suggest you use Jin and practise CD to iWS+2 before attempting 
Kaz's iWS+1,2 from CD since I myself think that Kaz's version is 
slightly more tricky to do.

Tagging 
-------

Tekken Tag wouldn't be half the game if it weren't for this element -
TAGGING! A lot of players do NOT understand the tagging system of
Tekken Tag Tournament. From what I observe when playing, many players
blindly tag out when they are low on health. Yes, I know that you have
to bring in a fresh new partner because your character can be easily
KO'ed but by foolishly tagging out, they leave the poor tagging in
character open to all kinds of dangers. Worst is if you carelessly tag
out, your tagging out character may be KO'ed in the process. Do this to
me and I will undoubtedly punish you with something nasty.
Think about this, your character is low on health but if you bring a
fresh new character in and say Julia hits you with a Heaven Cannon
Unblockable + Juggle, your partner could be even more badly hurt than 
the initial fighter that just tagged out. Morever, your opponent is 
given the initiative to pound you into oblivion with all kinds of 
Okizeme attacks.

As a rule of thumb you should only tag out when
1) Your opponent is on the ground or your opponent is far away and not
   is not able to hit you.
2) You use a tag throw or do a tag combo. 2+5 is a very safe tag throw
   but the damage depends on Kazuya's partner (ie Bruce = very lil,
   Michelle = qutie a lot) Kazuya's special tag throw with Jun is VERY
   VERY VERY useful and is guaranteed (unlike say special tag throws 
   between Julia and Michelle) if the stone head is not escaped. Use it 
   a lot since Jun will get a free Okizeme attack too.
3) The worst time to tag out is when your opponent is charging up an
   unblockable or heavy hitting move. More likely than not, your
   partner will come rushing in only to be hit by the said move.
4) If your opponent is all over you and you need to tag out, try to
   knock him down or at least push him away so before making a tag. For
   this reason, knock-away moves like Kaz's f+2 are ideal.
5) When you do tag, try to come in with a cross chop or tag slide (or
   its equivalent), at least once in a while, so that your opponent
   will not get into a habit of always trying to counter you when you
   tag out. Tag slides are useful not only because they can catch your
   opponent unaware but can be used to tag in an extra bit of damage
   at the end of a juggle. Also tag slides may be an excellent counter
   to certain moves (say Yoshi's b,b+1~1) At certain distance, tag in
   cross chop is almost unavoidable. Sadly Kaz does not have Tag slides
   or cross chops so this only applies to his partner. Remember too 
   that King, Yoshi and Kuni does not have Tag slide and Devil/ Angel
   does not have a cross chop. 
6) Tag frequently when given the chance to tag out. The small health
   regained may be the difference at the end of the bout. Also, do not
   get predictable with your tagging. A wrong tag will probably result
   in a nice WGF up your shiny noses.
7) If tag slides or cross chops are not your thing, you can always
   cancel the run in by inputting u~ub. This will stop your character
   from running and you can block or input your attack. This technique
   is also useful for doing some of the class 1 launcher juggles where
   you need to position yourself. It is usually much wiser (and safer)
   to use use the tag cancel since you do not need to commit to and
   attack and thus do not lose any initiative. Moreover Kazuya has a
   special way of Canceling his tagging in and that is with his mist 
   step (f,N)
8) Like everyone she can cancel his tag in with d+1. Don't be stupid 
   however and d+1 all the time, especially when your opponent is up 
   your nose because he will almost always CH you. I think you should 
   know by now that Julia's CH 1~2,1 is not very nice.

With all said, I also find that a lot of Tekken Tag players do NOT use
tag juggles enough. Come on, the damage lost during tag juggles cannot
be recovered. I can't remember how many close battles I won because of
the 'extra' health I could regain from tagging out. This is even more 
apparent with Kazuya who is a poor juggler overall, so after a WGF, it
is avisable to tag out to better Jugglers like Jin, Bruce or even Julia
to finish the job. This is not called TTT for nothin' you know.


************
Positioning
************


Movement of course will lead to positioning. I find it sad that a lot
of players nowadays do not understand positioning. Kazuya has excellent  
movement in his game with his CD/WD/LD but a rather below average SS 
game (quite wide but no where near Ogre, and no double/triple SS). His 
LD is THE killer for backdashers and is extremely dangerous even for 
Lei Haha steppers. Also his SS, although not the greaters can get you 
into very advantageous positions if timed correctly. As such I have 
subdivded into 5 categories - In Close, Dash range, Far, Side, Back

In Close
--------
The In-your-face, melee situation. This is the most common of 
situations especially against fast pokers (of which there are a lot). 
IMO this is NOT the preferred range a Kazuya player should be in. Why 
you ask? Because Kazuya has a 10 frame jab and he will lose out jab for 
jab against faster 8 frame jabbers. Against the Changs for example, 
this can be very bad since on CH they get a meaty juggle. My advice is 
to Watch your frame rate and do not just poke happily. Try to fight 
your way out of this range with CALCULATED pokes of your own. 

Dash Range
----------
Inevitably after pounding your opponent for some time, there is going
to be some space left between you and your opponent. This is THE 
STRONGEST part of Kazuya's Game. With his CD/WD/LD he is almost 
invincible. His CD will neutralize all high attacks and some mid 
attacks if timed correctly and his WGF will be at the touch of a 
button. At this range, WGF will OUTPRIORITIZE almost every move your 
opponent throws at you. If your opponent decides to turtle up you will 
end up in close with your opponent BUT with the advantage of the 
CD/WD/LD. This is when you use your CD mixups to your advantage. Watch 
out though for Yoshi flash though!

Far
---
Not really an advantageous position for Kazuya since he does not have 
long range moves (like T.Ogre Flame for example) or very good long 
range moves (P.Jack's SS+1 for example) to capitalize on. At such a 
distance you can either safely tag out or close the distance on your 
opponent with a LD.

Side
----
Kazuya's Side game is almost NON existent. Well who cares? You'd prolly 
get to your opponents side by Sidestepping his move, so WGF and juggle 
him. Since you are at his side, you will flip him over and you can end 
your juggle with a flip kick.... all without a CH WGF. If your opponent 
is grounded and you are at his Side (or SS'ed to his side) this is a 
good opportunity for you to use his f+4 bait (which has been explained 
in detail already)  or SS again to get to your opponent's back.

Backturned
----------
Unfortunately for Kazuya, he does not have much moves to capitalize on 
in such a position. The best you can do is WGF,4 juggle. Kazuya's WGF 
juggle on a BT opponent is severely hampered by his lack of moving 
attacks (like Jin's b,f+2,1,2) Moreover, if you get your opponent into 
BT position via OB trap (refer more on that in the Okizeme section) the 
best bet is his WS+2. Also try Kazuya's backthrow for 50 points damage 
and a 13 point follow up if you can land a throw.


**************
Custom Strings
**************

As you might or might not have noticed I have revamped the Custom 
strings section because most of the strings I gave in the previous 
updates of the FAQs are pretty worthless above even beginner level. 
Anyways I was really lazy to change stuff, but since this is the last 
verison of the FAQ, I might at least correct all the BS in it.

First off a player has to have a good understanding of frame data to be 
able to pull of a decent (and safe strings) Without proper 
understanding and using the same string over and over again you are 
just asking yourself to be CH'ed by Julia for a 70+ point juggle. The 
ability for a good player to string reflects on his understanding of 
any given situation and how he reacts appropriately towards it.

Poking Moves:-
1,1
1,2
1,2,4
d+1
d+2
d+3
d+4
(df_WS_f,n,d,df,f)+4
WS+1,(2)
df+1
db+4
f+2
f+4

String enders:-
WS+2 
WS+1,2
WGF
TGF,3_4
b+1+4
Hell Sweep(s)
(df_WS_f,n,d,df,f)+4<4
1,2,4
1,1<2
f+1+2
f+2
f+4
f,f+1+2
Generic throws.

Well I have basically broken down the moves down into 2 categoris that 
is moves you should use to poke with and moves to end the string with.

Poking moves:
-------------
Moves to poke with are usually moves which are relatively quick, safe, 
recover quick, closes distance well or gives you a good frame advantage 
for which you can pile up the pressure on your opponent. 

Moves like 1,1, and 1,2 are good quick pokes which are quick, safe when 
blocked, has forward momentum to close distance and recover quick when 
blocked. It does not however give you a frame advantage when blocked or 
if it connects. Other moves that fall in this category are df+4 and 
WS+1.

Then there are moves which are quick interrupt moves. For Kazuya there 
aren't much. d+1 is the most obvious one in mind though the slower d+2 
too can be used. d+1 has very poor range, but it is extremely fast (8 
frames) which makes it good to interrupt your opponent's slower moves.

f+4, db+4 and df+1 on the other hand are relatively slower poke moves. 
However both are still good pokes because they recover very well if 
blocked and gives the player a frame advantage when it is blocked, hit 
or both. The frame advantage gives you time to close in on your 
opponent and force him to guess your next move.

Moves like f+2 can be classified as both a poking move as well as a 
string ender. As a poking move, should it hit, it does not knock your 
opponent down but gives you a frame advantage instead. 

String Enders:
--------------
The ultimate purpose for poking is not only to chip away your 
opponent's health but to land that all important move which will give 
you a meaty juggle, CH and knock your opponent away with half his bar 
gone (yah right... that only applies to deathfist) or maybe to break 
your opponent from turtling.

String enders are usually chosen according to the situation whether 
your opponent is crouching, standing or attacking.

Crouching opponent. You would be aiming to hit him with mid moves. For 
this purpose, f+4 as a string ender is excellent (though slow) since it 
guarantees you a free WGF juggle. iWS+1,2 (or WS+1,2) df+2, df+4,4, 
f+1+2 can all be used for the same purpose, varying in properties. For 
example df+4,4 should be used relatively close to your opponent, but 
you might want to try the slower, longer range f+1+2 in dash range. 
Recognizing the situation is important because a wiff in a string ender 
usually means a free juggle for your opponent.

Standing opponent. In such a situation there are two options for you. 
Pound him with low hitting moves or throw him. Low hitting moves as 
string enders aren't really common for kazuya and in fact he only has 
one - hell sweeps. However since his can be initiated quickly via mist 
step cancel there really isn't a problem. Also you can try throwing 
your opponent with stone head or any other generic throw. Mix them up 
though so that you don't get predictable. If they turtle too much, 
maybe a surprise unblockable is the call of the day.

Attacking opponent. In such a situation there are two things you can 
do. CH him or back up so that his move will wiff and then juggle him 
while he is recovering. Both are good and bad and experience is needed 
to know what to do for each situation. For example if your opponent 
tries to interrupt your string with d+1, you can easily back up from it 
(in fact at times because of the distance between you and your opponent 
you might not need to even back up) and then hammer him with a quick 
df+4,4 before he can hit you with a WS move. If however he is opting to 
go for a power move like Deathfist for example, you might want to WGF 
him on CH which would give you a meaty juggle. Backing off and hoping 
that your opponent wiffs is safer but remember you CAN be hit during 
the backdash animation. Moreover if you choose wrongly, it could mean a 
missed opportunity or a huge CH for him.

What makes a string a Good string?
----------------------------------
Flow, unpredictability and overall safety. Basically these are the main 
ingredients for a good solid string, though some may opt to deviate a 
bit to add more spice (and risk) to their attack. 

Compare the two strings below.

f,f, 1,1, d+1, d+3, WS+1,2
f,f, 1,1, d+3, WS+1,2
f,f, 1,1, d+1, WS+1,2

Which of the above is the best string?
Although none of them are really good strings, the 3rd string would 
obviously be the best choice. Why? 

For string #1 following 1,1 with d+1 is very safe (8 frames) however 
the d+3 after d+1 is too risky since it has a long execution. Moreover 
considering the range you will be after your opponent blocks your move,  
your opponent could easily have backdashed (or actually walked back) out
of the range and hit you instead.

For string #2 after 1,1, d+3 is a POOR follow up since it has a too 
slow execution time. However it would be harder for your opponent to 
backdash out of d+3 after blocking 1,1, as compared in the first string 
after considering the block range. Moreover in both cases, even if d+3 
should hit you WILL be at a frame disadvantage when you initiate the 
Twin pistons (WS+1,2)

String #3 is the safes among all. Why? Again after 1,1, d+1 is totally 
safe being only 8 frames. Even if d+1 is blocked by your opponent, (and 
leaving you in a slight frame disadvantage) the WS+1,2 comes out 
relatively fast and your opponent would not be able to counter you with 
anything serious. Plus if d+1 should connect you will be at a +8 frame 
advantage which would mean your opponent cannot do anything but BLOCK 
your subsequent move. In such a case you MIGHT want to risk a d+3 
(though I recommend d+4 over it any day) or crouch cancel into a throw.

Got the basic idea yet?
After getting the picture of what is proper and improper in a string 
you would be able to create strings of your own. Here are just a few 
more examples for you.

1) 1,2, d+1, WS+4, df+4,4
1,2 as stated earlier when I analyzed it has better tracking and 
overall more momentum. If your opponent tries to Counter you after a 
1,2 punch interrupt him with d+1. The safest option here would be WS+4. 
If WS+4, is blocked this would put space between you and your opponent. 
A quick df+4,4 here is chosen since it does not need a CD motion to 
pull out (though experts should try MS cancel WGF) and has good range 
to punish opponents who try to Counter attack after seeing the single 
rising kick.

2) 1,2, df+2, f+2_WGF
When seeing 1,2 punches most opponents will usually duck in 
anticipation of the low 4 follow up. Punish them with df+2 (which will 
most likely be on a normal hit). On hit it will give you a frame 
advantage. Most players have a bad habit of trying to retaliate after 
eating a df+2 so you can go for a CH f+2 or WGF since the spacing 
should be just right.

3) 1,2, d+1, WS+4, 1,2, d+1, WS+4,.....
This is an infinite string. Stay clear from it. I just put it here to 
tell you that Kazuya can create infinite strings, but like ALL infinite 
strings they ARE crap.

4) 1,2, d+1, WS+4, 1,2, iWS+1,2_f+4
In this string you train your opponent to anticipate the d+1 after a 
blocked 1,2 punch. Most players will move their sticks to df in order 
to parry the d+1 (and in turn give them the advantage) Use this to your 
advantage by pulling out an iWS+1,2 to juggle them. Alternatively f+4 
can be used to crouch stun them.

5) CD~db+1, 1,2, CD~f+4, df+4, f+1+2
This isn't the best of strings but the CD (use WD or LD if you want) 
will add a lot of confusion for your opponent. I chose CD~db+1 which is 
actually CD cancel into iWS+1 since it recovers quite well and 
continued to poke with 1,2. Note that although you technically (by 
reading frame data that is) CAN be CH'ed by your opponents (Changs 
including)  a blocked CD~db+1 at maximum range will usually put you out 
of Chang's standing 1 reach so they won't be able to CH you. Watch out 
for fighers with longer jabs though. Anyways the 1,2 punches when 
blocked will create some more space. Use CD to WS+4 to continue the 
string since it has better range than that of CD to iWS+1. df+4 after 
that is used to push your opponent further away if needed. After 
creating a good amount of distance, you could try a risky f+1+2 and 
should your opponent try any High poke you would be able to CH him. 
SWELL!


Well these are just examples. Remember even with such a small number of 
moves, Kazuya's strings can be endless. Be creative and vary your 
strings. There is no greater killer than telling your opponent what you 
are going to do next by being predictable.


***********************************
Attack, Countering and Interrupting
***********************************

Ah Well... since this is the last version of the FAQ, I thought "What 
da heck, I might as well make it as complete as possible." 
Knowing when to counter and interrupt is an integral part for all 
characters and Kazuya is no exception. Again I bring about the 
situation of Kazuya vs Julia. Attacking at the wrong time could land 
you with a CH juggle. Same goes for countering and Interrupting.


Attacking
---------
Basically most of the general ideas for Attacking have already been 
covered in depth in the custom strings department. So what else do i 
have to add here? Watch your spacing. Knowing your frames and how fast 
a move can come out only helps you so much. You really need to know 
what moves will wiff and what moves won't. When playing Sonic the 
Hedgehog there is the saying "When in doubt Jump" This cannot be 
applied in Tekken however since even if you do a d+1 you risk yourself 
being CH'ed. Knowing when to attack is vital. For example you would be 
able to safely poke Jin after blocking his d+1 since it gives him a 
frame disadvantage but trying to poke after getting hit by the same d+1 
is asking to be killed since he gets +8 frame advantage.

Countering & Interrupting
-------------------------
Countering here does not refer to CH but rather hitting your opponent 
after he wiffed a move. Knowing which move to counter with is again 
vital. If your opponent wiffed a move which recovers fast, you might 
want to hit him with 1,1,2 shining fist for quick easy damage. On the 
other hand if you blocked Nina's db+3+4 which gives you 16 frame 
advantage you might want to try a quick WGF to juggle her. Not knowing 
what move to retaliate wiff could not only mean a missed juggle 
opportunity but more severly you getting CH'ed instead. An example of a 
misjudged counter would be after blocking Julia's d,df+1,2 and you 
attempt a WGF. Even though a blocked d,df+1,2 will give Julia -7 frame 
disadvantage, she can mash 1~1,1 while you have to carefully time a 
quick WGF. Technically you should be able to CH her 1~1,1 but if you 
are not careful you yourself and do your WGF too slowly (or misjudge 
your blocked recovery) you yourself could be at the end of a CH.

Interrupting on the other hand refers to CH'ing your opponent. To 
interrupt your opponent you have to hit your opponent while he is in 
the process of attacking. This is usually hard for beginners but it is 
the most common way for Kazuya to land a stun juggle. Again knowing 
when to interrupt is vital and thus you must have substantial knowledge 
of your opponent. Consider this situation. Julia does d,df+1. Would you 
try to CH her with 1,1,2 or will you turtle up? If you knew anything 
about julia, you would know that she can delay the flash elbow after 
d,df+1. If you tried to CH her with 1,1,2 you would instead get CH'ed 
by the flash elbow and stunned instead. On the other hand, if Julia did 
d+2,N+3,1 you could safely CH her after bloking d+2,N+3. At the end of 
the day, proper judgement will safe your ass and maybe win you the 
game.


*************************
To Parry or Not to Parry
*************************

Okay, so you are probably pyschic enough to know that your opponents 
next move would be a db+4 by Lei. Question what do you do, what do you 
do? With the introduction of Universal Parries as well as the Sweep 
Stagger system, there is more than one way to 'counter' Low attacks, so 
to speak. With this in mind, players sometimes do not know when may be 
the ideal time to parry or block. Both has its pros and cons. Btw when 
I speak of parries, I am referring to the universal parry and not 
command parries or punch parries. 

Blocking
The reason you'd want to block a low attack is because you know that 
the low attack will stagger your opponent and as such give you a good
opportunity to nail them with a WS move (TP baby!) However, your 
opponent usually needs to be quite close to you for the block to 
produce a stagger. Block if you know your opponent move has a chance of
getting staggered or if it will stop his momentum going e.g. Hell 
sweep, Lei's db+4, Paul's d+4 Juli's b+3 etc. Also block if you know 
your opponents move will give you a huge frame advantage e.g. Kazuya's  
1,2,4, the 9th Hit in Pauls' 1,2,3,1,4,2,1,4,2,1 10 string, Jun's 
d+3+4, Can-can Kicks.

Parry
The reason you'd wanna use the universal low parry (df) is because it
ALWAYS gives you the initiative no matter what. A parried low punch 
would give you get 9 frames advantage and with a parried low kick you 
will get 16 frames of advantage. Obviously, the 9 frames after a 
parried low punch do not mean much especially since parrying will often
shift your opponent off the axis a bit, so technically after
readjusting yourself, your advantage is less than 9 frames. The parried
low kick will give you a bigger advantage, enough time for you to take
advantage of. For Kazuya, the best he can do is df+4,4 and even get off 
a quick Mist step cancel WGF (gotta be QUICK though). I'd generally say 
use parries if you know that the move WON'T stagger and instead leave 
your opponent relatively safe (either because of frame advantage or 
quick follow ups) e.g.  Chang's 4,4, Law's Junkyard Kick combo (2nd 
hit) Lee's d+4,4,4,4 (second hit can be parried even if first hits)

At the end of the day, a correct parry or block could mean defeat or 
victory especially in a tight battle.

Kazuya's Juggles
****************

If all you did was scroll right down here to read the Juggles section, 
then don't be surprised if your sorry @$$ is creamed by someone who can 
properly set up juggles. I am rather lazy with the juggles section so 
all I did was copy out the juggle list from www.tekkenzaibatsu.com so 
all credit to them for the good job. Please remember that the stun 
Juggles CAN be escaped and as such should not be considered TRUE 
juggles. However since scrubby players never ever escape stuns (and 
good players sometimes forget to do so), they are listed here for your 
convienice.

My 2 Cents on Juggling
----------------------

It is always important to remember that during a close fight to do not 
only the most damaging juggle but also the one you are most confident 
of pulling off. I mean sure you may be able to pull off the triple WGF 
consistently when playing around with your buddys but when you are up 
against a Tekken Expert in the arcades things will be very different. 
My advice is to do an easier juggle if you aren't confident of 
finishing a more complicated juggle rather than settling for a missed 
opportunity. Below are my favourite juggle list which I do depending on 
the situation. 

REMEMBER! Since the source of most of your juggles will be from WGF, 
          WS+1,2 and occasionally CH df+2 it is VITAL that you know at
          least one reliable (and preferably damaging) juggle you can
          rely on when all fails. WGF,4 is a very good example since
          it is impossible to wiff and does insane damage.


1) WS+1,2_WGF, 1,1_1,2, df+4,4_f,N,d,df+4,4
The easiest juggle from the WGF and one which I know I won't miss. I 
will do this during a really really close battle and am under 
tremendous pressure. Moreover, the damage done from this juggle is more 
than satisfying. A small note, if you do 1,2 then the df+4,4 will hit 
almost all the time. If you use 1,1 though, the last hit of df+4,4 will 
have a higher chance of missing therefore use f,N,d,df,f+4,4 instead. 
As for the juggle from the Twin Pistons, I'd prefer 1,2 over 1,1.

2) WGF, WGF, WGF
Done when I'm facing a scrub or have won the first round and intend to 
have fun during the second. More for showing off actually since it may 
be hard to pull off consistently in arcades with bad diagonals. Sides,
a tag out juggle to good jugglers will do more damage. My tip on 
performing the Triple WGF combo for Kaz would to make full use of his 
Mist Step Cancel into WGF.

3) WGF (CH), 1,2, f,n,d,DF+4,4
I like doing this combo because if the opponent is flipped and I hit 
him on the ground there seems to be this nice rumbling effect. The 
damage done here is about the same as the 1,2, df+4,4 finish so I'd 
only do this if I'm tired of pulling the df+4,4 off.

4) WS+2 (CH), WGF, WGF, df+4,4
Forget the WS+2 since its prolly impossible nowadays to get a good 
player to NOT escape the CH stun should you be lucky enough to land it.
The timing for the WGF is similar to that of Jin's EWGF after a CH 
b,f+2. There is only a small frame for execution and is extremely
difficult if you don't have those oh so sharp reflexes. I chose WGF, 
WGF, df+4,4 because it does more damage than triple WGF and is even 
easier to do.

5) df+2 (CH), WGF, WGF, df+4,4
I have only done this ONCE my whole Tekken life. But this combo really
takes off a LOT of damage - something around 108 points and that is
the MOST any character can do off a stun which is inescapable. If you
have mastered this combo, your Kazuya is something to be feared since 
it is combo like this which can turn a losing match into a win.

6) WGF, 1, 1, 1, 1, WGF
On a good day I may get this combo down, but since I pull this combo 
off all to inconsistently (and because I could do an easier combo 
rather than do this) I only use this combo to intimidate my foe when I 
am toying with him. For close battles though, I'd do 1, 1, 1, WGF 
instead of 1, 1, 1, 1, WGF. Remember to have all the left punches 
connect you need to do f,F+1 instead of f,f+1.

7) WGF (CH), 1, 1, 1, WGF, uf~4~3
Hehe... a new combo demonstrated by Castel in his latest Kazuya Juggle 
Movie Act 2. Ultimately, one of the coolest combo by far as you can tag 
in Kazuya's seemingly useless flip Kick into the combo. And as always 
the nice rumbling sound when you hit a flipped opponent makes this 
ROCK! Real damaging and guaranteed to embarass your opponent for letting 
such a useless move hit them. For people who can't seem to get the 
1,1,1, WGF , do 1,1, WGF instead. One small note, the flip kick 
escapability depends on the height of which you hit your opponent with
the last WGF, meaning that if you hit at a low height the flip kick is
guaranteed. Also hitting your opponent at a low height will give you 
that cool rumbling effect. Thanks 7ronko for rephrasing this for me, 
think some people may have misunderstood what I was trying to say. ;)

8) f+1+2, b+1+4
The GDF has ousted WS+2(CH) since I have been using it a LOT. (it is 
actually darn useful ya know!) The timing for b+1+4 after f+1+2 is 
critical since you have around 1 frame of slop. Of course hitting an
unblockable on any stun is cool so this combo gets my nod.

9) WGF, 1, 1, 1, 1, (2), 4
This is more for show-off than anything, since the jabs don't do that 
much damage, yet you are keeping your opponent air-borne for quite some
time. Good for time wasting or to irritate your opponent. (Try talking
to your opponent while you are doing this combo)

10) f+1+2, f,n,d,df+4, 1, f,n,d,df+4, df+4
Of the few times that I use the Glorious Demon Fist, this is my 
favourite juggle out of it. Remember that you need to need to do the
Tsunami Kicks off a CD since the f+1+2 knocks your opponent away a bit.
If you did the Tsunami Kick quick enough, you should be able to connect
with F+1 and the rest of the combo should be a piece of 'Kick'. Another 
recommendable combo is f+1+2, WGF, df+4,4. Simple and damaging.... but 
then again all combos off f+1+2 are.

My Fave' Tag Juggles
--------------------
*note* unless stated in Parenthesis, all moves are assumed to be that 
       of Kazuya's.

1) with Julia
WGF~5, (Julia) f,f+1, f,f+1, f,f+1, d,df+1,2
Easy combo, irritating elbows, good damage. The ingredients of a good
combo. Julia is a combo machine and if mastered, her elbows will only
add to the fustration of your opponent watching those not so damaging
swats juggle you over and over again. Pulling d,df+1,2 at the end of
the combo should not be a problem for Kaz players who have mastered 
the art of WGF. LOL Anyways remember to do f,f,N+1 for the elbows. If
you are in a nasty mood you might wanna try Julia's Wonder combo (Julia
players will know what I mean but for those who don't it is d+2, FC,df+
4,3, df+4<2<b,f+1)

2) with Bruce
WGF~5, (Bruce) b+3_2, Cheese Knees (b+4,3,4)
Knee, Knee, Knee... thats 50% of your opponent's life lost. This combo
is so easy to do that any scrub could abuse it. b+3 is the way to go 
since it does the most damage, but if you are having trouble timing 
the b+3 then by all means tag on a simple 2 or omit that and go 
straight into the Knees. Better yet tag the WGF after a WS+2 or df+2
stun.

3) with Lee
(Lee) d~db+4~5,(Kaz) TGF, 1, WGF
Do the TGF as early as possible or else the 1 will never, and I mean 
EVER connect. (sorry... couldn't help it) Either that or you can cancel
the run in (u~ub) and initiate the TGF. Do F+1 and not a simple 1 and
then the WGF should be a piece of cake. For those having trouble, try
something easier like TGF, df+4,4 for 80+ points of damage.

4) with Angel
(Angel) SS+2~5, (Kaz) B+1+4
Err.... B+1+4?!?! Yepz.. Too bad this is a PS2 only combo (you can 
partner Kazuya with Angel in arcade TTT) B+1+4 does CRAP loads of 
damage. If you can't do this, opt for the simpler, SS+2~5, b+1+4 
instead.

5) with Jun
WGF~5, (Jun) b+2<1+2, 1+4,(2),d+4
I just had to put in a combo with Jun since I'm such a Jun fan... so 
here goes. Remember to delay b+2<1+2 or the second hit will definitely 
wiff. The rest is crap easy. You can watch this in Hameko's Kazuya 
video.

6) with Jun
(Jun) F+2~5, (Kaz) WGF~5, (Jun) f,f,n+4
Not much to speak about... and not much skill involved but here is 
another tag combo with Kazuya and Jun, and since I just like Jun 
soooooooooo much, I had to put it in.

7) with Jun
f,f+1+2~5, (Jun) FC,df+2
You gotta be quick after the arm bar with Jun for the FC,df+2 to hit 
your grounded opponent. Its a standard, easy for Crying out loud to do
combo. Remember that your opponent can escape the initial stonehead
throw.

8) with Bruce
f+1+2,5 (Bruce) df+3, b+4,3,4
This is a very cool combo since the stun is inescapable. It is inspired
by Agent 3:16 in his Mishima movie. Agent 3:16 has since retired. 
Anyways, since f+1+2 cannot be tagged out of automatically (like you 
can with WGF or WS+1,2) you have to tag out of it manually. If you are
not sure of the timing, just keep mashing 5. With bruce, df+3 (the low
sweep) is used to pick up the falling opponent before you finish them 
off with the dreaded cheese knees. Be careful because this combo has 
the tendency to wiff (a lot) against small characters like Julia. I'm 
quite sure that you can substitute f+1+2 with a CH df+2 if you feel 
that f+1+2 is too risky. 

9) with Jin
WGF~5, (Jin) b,f+2,1<2, EWGF
A not so quite difficult combo once you get the timing down. Its all in 
the delaying of the final puch in the laser cannon combo. Also to get 
the EWGF to hit you have to do a Dash EWGF (DEWGF).

10) with Bryan
(Bryan) CH WS+3, b+1~5 (Kazuya) f,n,d,df,f+4, 1, WGF~5, (Bryan) f,f,n+4
Woahhhhhhhh such a long combo.. which is actually quite easy in truth. 
The tricky part of this combo lies in the f,n,d,df,f+4 rising kick. You 
have to time is JUSTTTT right so that you'll be able to connect with 
the standing Jab and thus the WGF. A cool combo but do note that the CH 
WS+3 stun CAN be escaped.

*******
Okizeme
*******

I must admit that if there is ONE glaring weakness of Kazuya, it is 
that his Okizeme game isn't up there with Nina, Ling, Anna etc. Problem 
is he can't keep his opponent on the ground the whole day. But that 
doesn't mean that Okizeme isn't an integral part of his game. I'd take 
any free hits that I can come along because the damage will add up at 
the end of the day. That said, Kazuya has some good Okizeme moves like

WGF
db+4,
d+1
d+3
f,n,d,DF+4,4
df+4,4_f,n,d,df+4,4
4~3
WS+2
df+2
and others......

If you see your opponent rolling on the ground, either do d+1, d+3 or 
db+4. You can do df+4,4 too. In fact, df+4 is guaranteed after certain 
moves (it was guaranteed after a Stonehead throw but you can now tech 
out of it) d+3 should be used if your opponent refuses to move when he 
is on the ground. However just bear in mind that if you hit your 
opponent with a d+3 chances are that he will be knocked quick some 
distance away and can easily recover. The idea of Okizeme is of course 
to try and keep your opponent on the ground for as long as possible.
I'd suggest hell sweeps but if it is blocked, you will suffer the sweep 
stagger syndrome. You can safely hell sweep if he is rolling on the 
floor but I strongly suggest you do not Hell sweep him if he is quick 
recovering and is going to block low. 

Use WS+2 to get a CH on opponents who rise with a standing kick or df+2 
if you weren't in the FC position before this. You can also use your 
WGF to punish a missed rising kick or sweep. The Demon Scissors should 
only be used if your opponent has been flipped over (a WGF on CH easily 
does the job) and cannot quick recover or if he is rolling forward 
towards you. Be careful when you throw the Demon Scissors though 
because its execution time is awfully slow and you will take damage if 
you so much as wiff. 

Of course those of you who bothered to read the movement section would 
have realised the best okizeme would be to Wave dash and put pressure 
on your opponent. Ultimately though, the best Okizeme Attack is one 
which does not your opponent on the ground - WGF. For all kinds of 
situation (rolling back, side roll, tech roll, get up with attack) 
WGF is the answer to all of them. Proper implementation of a Wave dash
can and will keep your opponent grounded for the whole match. Here is
a typical scenario.
Your opponent is on the floor and you are wavedashing at him. If he 
chooses to :
1) ROLL BACK - Which is what scrubs usually do, WGF immediately and 
   put him back on the ground. Rinse and repeat.
2) ROLL FORWARD - He is really asking for it since well he is 
   vulnerable to anything. Well anything like WGF should do.
3) ROLL SIDEWAYS - What good players would usually do and while you do
   not have anything guaranteed, if you time it right and sidestep with
   them, you can WGF them. However should they get up, before you can 
   do anything about that, you still have the advantage, mainly the
   WS+1,2 or Hell sweep guessing game. If you should get the better in 
   this 50-50 situation, then you can repeat the whole procedure again.
4) GET UP WITH ATTACK - Another sign of scrubbiness. If you anticipate
   this, WGF immediately. You will most likely get them on CH in which
   case you should just juggle them and continue wave dashing.
5) DO NOTHING - Well, you could wave dash continuously until they time
   runs up, your hands are tired, or he is tired of waiting. You could 
   also just do d+3 which hits them low but sends them away thus 
   allowing them to get up safely.

More Okizeme Stuff
------------------

Maybe this section to be called "setups" but lets get to the meat of 
the strats. Much like Jin, Kazuya has a lot of of options for Okizeme
even when on the surface he doesn't seem to have a lot of good low
hitting attacks (bar Hell sweeps of course) 

1) OB trap no.1
After a Hell sweep, and should Kazuya's opponent's is in PLD position 
ie head be lying towards you (first sweep trips), you can try wiffing a 
WS+4 (from Wave dash or whatever means) Upon seeing this, your opponent 
will most likely have very itchy fingers and try to get up with a WS 
attack. This is when you interrupt his get up attack with a d+1 of your 
own. Timed correctly, you will interrupt your opponent's animation and 
Backturn him giving you a free hit opportunity. Now the problem with 
Kazuya is the fact that he doesn't have much options after that. WS+2 
and WS+1,2 or maybe WS+4,4 are his best bets from WS position. WS+2 
does good damage. On Clean hit or CH, your opponent will be sent 
popping in the air and depending on your axis (and size of character) 
you may be able to pull off short juggles like say... 4 for example. 
WS+1,2 is your best bet for juggles but it wiffs almost always and will 
only juggle if you are not directly behind your opponent (ie slightly 
to the side) so if its Ling you are facing then you will meet up with 
her BK, 4 and juggle. And WS+4,4 I would consider a safe option.. does 
the most damage on its own but nothing else. Compared to Jin who's WS+2 
has good range and can further juggle you with Laser Cannon's Kazuya 
may not be as good, but this strategy is certainly worth mentioning

2) OB trap no.2
When your opponent is down from a normal move (Stone head can apply 
here assuming your opponent does not tech), you can try jumping over
his body and if he should decide to rise, you can d+1 him and Backturn
him. All strats above apply. I suggest only using this option when you
have run out of all other okizeme options and even then, use this 
sparringly.

3) OB trap no.3
You can also get your opponent into PLD position after Kazuya's 2+4 
throw. Wiff a WS+4 rising kick (via f,n,d,df,f+4 technique) and go 
immediately into d+1 to interrupt your opponent's attack. All followups
apply.

Note: It is not necessary for you to wiff a WS+4 kick and contrary to 
      popular believe not necessary for your opponent to rise with an 
      attack. In fact even if they try to rise up from the ground by
      tapping u when you d+1 them, you WILL BT them. The WS+4 kick is 
      just an example of a bait which you can use to trick your 
      opponent into getting himself backturned. You can use other 
      substitues like two d+1's in a row, 1,2 punches or a simple WS+1.
      The setups are endless.


**************
Chicken Buffer
**************

Chicken is another name for a reversal reversal. To do a chicken you 
press either f+1+3 or f+2+4 depending on the punch or kick that was 
reveresed. Some moves though use two buttons (f+1+2) so you have to 
know which buttons to press to chicken it. (its f+2+4 btw). Although 
I'd strongly suggest you incorporate chicken buffering into your normal 
game against reversal capable/happy characters, most average players 
find buffering chicken a confusing job and one which hampers their 
gameplay. 
There fore, for the aforementioned players, they have to use the tactic 
known as chicken baiting. Basically, they do an easily reversed move 
and buffer chicken hoping to catch a reversal happy player. Usually the 
moves chosen are slow, easily telegraphed moves like df+1, f+1+2, f+2. 
However as I mentioned before this, a good opponent will look at your 
hands to see if chicken is buffered and resist all temptations to 
reverse. Instead, he will just jab you out of all these moves as they 
come out so slowly.

Here are a list of Moves which are often reversed:
1,1,2 - last hit
1,2,2 - last hit
f+1+2
WS+1,2 - 2nd hit
df+4<4 - last hit
WS+2
df+2
df+1
f+2
TGF,3 - both hits
u_uf+4,4,4,4 - 1st and last hit
f+4
f,f+3
WR_f,f,f+3

My Favourite Chicken Baits:
f+1+2
WS+1,2 - last hit
WS+2
f+2
f+4
TGF,3 - last hit

*note* You cannot chicken King's Kick reversal and Wang's Left Punch 
       reversal.

... and of course if all fails there is always the Anti-reversal move
in the mighty WGF. 

**************
Throw Escaping
**************

Although this should not be in a Kazuya FAQ (this should be in a 
basics of Gameplay), I find that people do NOT escape throws enough.
Therefore, they deem throws cheap, when in fact you have a large
window of escape for most throws (bar throws like Mad Axes) Basically,
escaping throws is easy if you know which throw he is going to do and 
when. In theory it is easier said than done, but here are some 
pointers.

1) Watch your opponents hands. If the Left hand extends longer than
   his right, then he is going for a throw with a 1 break. If his
   right hand is longer than his left, then the break for the throw 
   is throw. If both hands extend equally, the break is 1+2. Of course
   there are some exceptions but this is the general rule.

2) With most throws, the escape frame is almost one full second. Watch
   for the purple flash whenever a person grabs you. Most opponents
   have a tendency to go for certain throws so it would be wise to 
   know before hand which throw he likes to go for.

3) When being thrown, and unsure, just press something (1,2 or 1+2)
   Pressing any of the combinations is better than not doing anything
   because you will have a 33.3% chance of breaking the throw.

4) Look at your opponents hands if possible. This does not apply only
   to Multithrows only. Looking at your opponent hands while playing
   not only tells you what throw he is going to do, but generally 
   gives away what he is going to do next.

5) Becareful when looking at your opponent's hands when he does Multis.
   Some Multi windows are pretty large and your opponent has loads of
   time to fake the throw. 

6) Although some people suggest the theory of 1~2(hold 2)~1 or 2~1(hold    
   1)~2 this theory has not been proven. I think that the escape of the
   throw depends on the frame of input of the escape. In other words, 
   the technique suggested by some people worked because it was 
   coincidence that they hit the correct escape button at the frame of
   escape.

Remember, everytime you escape a throw, you are avoiding 30+ damage and 
the follow up damage from Okizeme. When you think about it, thats 
almost the same damage from a WGF, 1,2, df+4,4 juggle. Therefore, do 
try and work on your throw escapes.



*************************
The Funny World of Tekken
*************************

There are many different kind of players around in the Tekken world. 
Here, I would break them all up into different categories, and explain 
which moves/tactics work extremely well on them

1. Scrubs (aka I Want to Play even if I don't know how to)
If you lose to any of these players at ANY time, you can be considered 
a scrub yourself. +DAMN, I just lost to a scrub lately *sob*+ 
Anyways the best way to deal with scrubs is to use cheesy attacks over
and over and over and over....again (preferably the attacks they love
to abuse but anything will do really) until they get pissed off and
decide never EVER to bother you again.


1.1 Eddy/Law/Hwoarang/Baek Mashers
These are players who couldn't care less about what you are doing or 
what they themselves are doing. They just bang the buttons as hard as 
possible, usually 1 or 2 buttons at most,  and hope to win. I hate 
these players a lot because they are the reason of faulty buttons, and 
inaccurate controllers. Basically, all your specially thought out 
custom strings are not going to work here, as you can't train them to 
do anything. To beat these scrubs, just abuse certain moves like crazy 
since they never learn how to block low. Example : Spinning Demon (uf+
4,4,4,4), Hell Sweeps (since they will probably not know how to get up, 
you can just sweep them to death). In the case of Hwoarang mashers, 
just duck the last hit of the 3,3,3,3 and counter with the DGP for 
~INSANE~ damage. The same applies to Baek and his strings. Do them a 
favour by canning them in record time and then giving them some money 
to go home.

1.2 Paul Deathfist/ Falling leaf players
Basically, these players play with only 2 moves..... deathfist (qcf+2) 
or the falling leaf combo (d+4,2) All their strategy revolves around 
confusing you between these 2 moves. Since the introduction of the 
sweep stagger in TTT though, the falling leaf combo has been tonned 
down a lot as in the sweep will only take you off your feet if is 
extremely near or hits on CH. Best yet, if you block the sweep, he will 
have suffer a looooooooong stagger recovery time. This is to the 
benefit to players as it kills the guessing game of deathfist or 
Falling leaf combo. However, a good player will probably poke the hell 
outta the fella before he even winds up with his deathfist. Good moves 
that Kazuya can use is the Gut Punch (df+2), WGF (which hits most of 
the time if you time it properly) , Hell Sweeps (for okizeme). 
Beware as these players may or may not know how to block low. Remember 
to becareful at ALL times because a Deathfist on CH is as bad as 
getting hit by most Unblockables.

1.3 i-M-Reversal-happy (Paul/Jin/Nina and rarely Jun/Wang)
*yAy* These are the most fun to play against. They think they are 
probably an expert player because they can reverse every move 
around...NOT! Do not mistake reversal happy scrubs with players who 
reverse at correct times (unchicken buffered moves). To identify this 
class of players, watch how they play. If they do a move, Reverse, Do 
another move, reverse, and never bother to use a low parry (because 
they say its a worthless move which does no damage) ... they are 
probably a scrub and this is where the fun begins. Just throw a move 
buffered with a chicken to bait them and laugh in their faces as they 
stare in horror at what you had done. Repeat again and again until they 
have finally learnt their lesson and stop using reversals permanently 
or they are dead. The sure sign that they are a scrub is when they 
can't fight back because you have thrown off their game plan. From 
here, just murder them with juggles and stun juggles of all sorts. For 
more info about chickening and chicken baiting, refer to the 
<Chickening Section>

1.4 I-Am-The-Best-10-Hitter (Paul/Nina/Yoshi/Baek/King are common)
Haha! Actually I love playing against players who think that 10 hits 
rule the world. To be honest, I was once a player in this class (until 
I got canned by my friends Julia and all her poking). These players do 
nothing but practise the 'ultimate art of 10-hit combos' while maybe 
throwing an odd move or two (maybe a rare deathfist or double palm). To 
have the most fun with these characters, I usually block the first 9 
hits of the combo to tell them that I know how to block their 10 hit 
combos and then poke him out of the 10th hit. But Alas, they never 
learn and will start again with the 10 hit combos. While playing these 
players, use low parries to your full advantage. You SHOULD always poke 
them out of the combo whenever possible since blocking isn't to your 
advantage (and this applies ESPECIALLY to yoshimitsu since the last few 
hits of his 10-hits are Unblockable). If possible CH him if he uses a 
slow move. Example, Block the first 9 hits of Pauls 1231421421 combo 
and rise with a DGP immediately after blocking the 9th hit (which hits 
low).... or you could easily just WGF him when he starts the 10 hit 
since most 10 hit scrubs prefer to start the first few hits far away 
(aka Wiff the first few hits).

1.5 Back Dashers
This class of "scrubs" can be intermediate opponents who have a very 
good understanding of the game, yet because of this bad habit it becomes 
their downfall. Backdashing is good to escape an attack. 
However, Namco did not want people to be turtling the whole day and as 
such made the character very vulnerable during backdashing and also 
when recovering. Backdasher raping is very fun. When in about dash 
distance, WGF, Yoshi df+2 and Jun's F+2 just to name a few works very 
well. More often then not, they will get popped into the air or sent 
flying across the screen while holding B and continue complaining about 
the controls being faulty. At 3 characters range, dash in moves like 
King's Shoulder Ram f+2+3, Body Splash f,f+2+3, Deathfist, Jin's f,f+2 
work excellent. The art of back dasher raping is an important one 
because there are a lot of gay opponents like nothing more than hit, 
backdash, throw backdash, hit backdash, backdash etc. 

1.6 Backrollers
This is the reason why 99.9999% of the scrubs are killed. Back rolling 
is often present not only in scrubs but in certain intermediate 
players. The problem with backrolling is because of the poor poor poor 
recovery time. During the initial frames of the back roll, you can be 
juggled out of it. For exampls Julia can d+1 you when you back roll, 
and continue with FC,df+4,3, df+4,2, b,f+1 for whopping damage. 
Moreover, moves like WD, WGF adds has a lot of distance and moves 
faster than back rolling. WGF will juggle at the final few frames of a 
back roll which means free juggle and okizeme again. Moreover, you can 
just WD WGF them again and again to put them back on the ground. Sooner 
or later he is going to call you cheap and walk away furiously.

1.7 The Yoshimishima's
These are the greatest scums of the Tekken scrubs. Its bad enough if a 
player has no knowledge of a game, but these people take it a level 
further - they refuse to learn anything about the game. Rather than 
making full use of the resources of the internet (and the ability to 
learn more at Forums) these lowest form of scum would rather waste 
their time trying to start flame wars in TZ. However these idiots will 
act all gentlemanly and all as if he is of a higher class then the 
people of TZ. However, it is very clear that they do not know anything 
about Tekken whatsoever and can easily be beaten by even the scrubiest 
of scrubs.

1.8 The iLuvMomo's
These are players who play and play and play and play.... TTT all day 
without caring about whats happening around the world. They don't give 
a fuck about their life, their friends, their family and especially 
their girlfriends. Their play is very good but they get distracted 
easily when they start losing and gets very upset when they get dumped 
by their girlfriends. These players are the scums of TTT and should be 
banned from all Tekken play. To get rid of these players easily just 
start a conversation about how he deserves to be dumped by his GF. 
However unless you are muscular, any such tactic would prolly result in 
your getting beaten up.

2. Novice (aka I think I'm an expert because I can beat Scrubs)
Novice players think they are hell great because they can do away with 
scrubs in record time or beat the CPU in the quickest fashion ever 
using a few moves. In my opinion novice players are more fun to play 
compared to scrubs because they KNOW what they are doing but still fall 
for each and every trick you pull out of your pocket.

2.1 Juggle Crazy 
Juggling is undeniably an essential part of any tekken player's game. 
However a novice player probably has only one thing in mind - juggle my 
opponent. Sure... if it hits cool, you will do loads of damage.... but 
getting your opponent to eat your juggle starter is another thing. My 
evolution from a 10-hit scrub went into this stage when all I did was 
try a juggle starter over and over again hopping my opponent would eat 
it. All I did was use Nina and Divine Cannon over and over again until 
I popped my opponent up into the air. Since the CPU is sadly extremely 
stupid and will fall for the Divine Cannon even if the first one is 
blocked, I abused this move a lot... but was soon taught a harsh lesson 
of reality. Juggle starters need to be set up properly if your opponent 
is going to eat it, but these players will probably go around doing 
consecutive WGF's, Divine Cannons etc  even if they KNOW its going to 
be blocked. In this case, just poke the hell out of them, use your 
custom strings to set up your own juggles and then laugh at them for 
being so foolish. 
*note* if your partner has a reversal... abuse it, since most juggle 
happy novices never bother with chickens, and if they do, it will mess 
up their gameplan anyways.

2.2 Multi-Throwers (King/Nina are common, Armor King/others are rarer)
I'm not sure whether to put these players in the scrub category or the 
novice category, but since they have done so much HARD work memorizing 
the multi-throw list, I should give them credit shouldn't I? All they 
do is just try to get you in a multi throw. Common are King's SS+2+4/ 
SS+1+3 series, the CD+1+4 series and Nina's QCF+1+2 series. Just duck 
whenever you see them aim for their multi throws (but beware as some 
King players may cancel the Multi throw in the SS series .... but then 
again if they do cancel their Multi's they are not novices) and learn 
the breaks if you unfortunately get caught in them. As a show off, you 
may want to break Nina's Multiparts or King's CD+1+4 series when they 
are extremely low on health as the minute amount of damage caused to 
them will kill them off.

2.3 The Apocalyspe (or formerly the MSGs)
This cateogory of Tekken players know just a lil bit of Tekken. However 
their main downfall is their interest in gaining more post counts 
rather than spending time practising their tekken. They will make 
stupid 3 line posts which do not help other fellow Tekken players. Say 
when a player asks for new combos for a certain character, they will 
say they don't know anything about that character. These players are 
usually about in their teens around 15 when they should spend more time 
jerking off instead of being a nuisance in TZ.

3. Intermediate (aka I am getting there....)
Intermediate players can be easily recognized by their style of play. 
They know probably the best moves of the character they are playing and 
how to block a few 10-hit strings (usually the common ones).  They know 
how to pull out some of the character's most damaging combos though 
even some hard ones (example :WGF,1,1,1,WGF) still elude them. 
Intermediate players can be identified by their limited amount of 
combos used, usually sticking to one or two which they find easiest to 
do.

3.1 Ways to identify an intermediate Mishima
Most players may have gone through this stage. While trying to learn 
any of the Mishima characters, they'd probably have had trouble doing 
the crouch dash motion. They may pull it off once in a while, but as 
everyone knows, consistency is the key in Tekken. (I mean you want that 
WGF to interrupt the ass outta what your opponent is doing everytime 
right?) Morever, most intermediate players have trouble pulling off WS 
moves consistently, and this puts them at a severe disadvantage since 
all 3 Mishima... or should I say the 2 Mishimas and the Kazama have 
excellent WS moves. Kazuya has his DGP (WS+2), Twin Pistons (WS+1,2), 
Jin has his single Piston (WS+2) or Twin Pistons (WS+1,2) and Heihachi 
has this new move <don't know whats its name> which works similar to 
Kazuya's DGP but is slower , again WS+2.
An intermediate player should be treated cautiously at all times and 
any attempts to show off may backfire severely on you (since as I 
pointed out they DO know how to play) I don't know how many times this 
has happened to me before but I got beaten by some fella who I knew I 
could beat easily because I tried to do one of those fancy (AND 
useless) moves/ juggles.
The best way to play against an intermediate players is to pressure him 
all out (I mean you are Kazuya right?) Poke the hell outta him and wait 
for his mistakes (due to his lack of experience)

3.2 Stance changers
If your opponent plays a character with lots of stance changes (Ling, 
Lei, Eddy, Hwoarang etc ) observe the way how he plays. Does he know 
how to change from one stance to the other stance with ultimate ease? 
For example, for Ling to go into her Backturned stance, does he ONLY 
use the f,f+3 racoon swing? An intermediate players KNOWS how to play 
in each stance, but gets predictable because he uses only a few moves 
to get into the stance. My point being that he can't change stance 
fluidly (which is important for the surprise factor). Another thing is 
when they change stance unknowingly, they'd get suprised themselves and 
may not know how to play correctly....so punish them with a meaty 
juggle/ stun combo so that they will finally choose someone as basic 
(yet as effective) as Kazuya.

Actually there are lots of ways to identify an intermediate player 
so the above are actually just some examples.

4. Advanced (aka I'm there....almost)
Well well well... they are probably one step from becoming an expert... 
but then that one step is a rather huge step. An advanced player is one 
who knows almost every trick of the trade in the game. But that doesn't 
mean that he will not fall for some moves at times. He knows how to 
break multi throws, he knows the break points for each 10-hit combo and 
WILL punish you each time you are foolish enough to use it. Hmm.... the 
best way to identify an advanced played is to watch him play against a 
reversal enabled character. If he can play consistenly while buffering 
chicken commands for each move then he probably is a advanced (if not 
close to expert player) An advanced player has very good juggle 
abilities though he may still not be able to do the extremely HARD 
combos (Ex: Jin's b,f+2 CH, EWGF, TGF +3) Still, he will be able to 
pull out some rather amazing and difficult combos consistenly.

4.1 Pitbull
Players who pitbull will do nothing but attack attack and attack all 
day. They will go all out at you trying to beat you into submission the 
minute the announcer goes fight. The problem with pitbull players are 
that if they somehow get pinned back by their opponent, they will be 
under immense pressure and sometimes may crack under it. Pitbulls 
utilize poking and interrupt tactics in their custom strings to their 
advantage, making sure you eat a juggle for each and every mistake that 
you commit. Best way to play against a pitbull is to play as one 
yourself, not giving the chance to attack, because in my personal 
opinion, the best form of defence is offence.

4.2 Turtler 
Not many characters can play a turtling game well. Probably Law and 
Ling are the best turtlers in the game because they can parry almost 
anything. Some people belive parrying is rubbish because it does no 
damage but come on.... a parry cannot be chickened, its final. A 
reversal can be chickened and you could end up looking like a fool for 
eating the damage yourself. Moreover, after a parry, you are given the 
initiative while your opponent struggles to find his footing, hence he 
may fall for your juggle starter. Law has the punch parry for example 
which has guaranteed follow ups (not to mention a meaty juggle at the 
end of it) The best way to play against a turtler is cautiously... lead 
him into your traps and not go blindly rushing in with a WGF (because 
he will probably d+1 you out of it most of the time before you can get 
anywhere near) Remember that given the opportunity, a turtler WILL 
attack so remember never to keep your guards down.

4.3 The Annaquin's
These are players who are highly skill and can actually play Tekken 
very well. However, they are very deceptive (or at least humble) about 
their skills by posting retarded strats on various Tekken forums as 
well as putting laughable match videos online to deceive you. Do not be 
fooled by them though because these players can take you out easily if 
you get too cocky. Usually plays Anna and Michelle.

4.4 The Night's
Another class of highly skilled players whose main downfall is their 
lack of resolve. They easily break down when under high pressure or 
when playing against a scrub style which they are not familiar with. 
This may be due to the poor joysticks in their arcade, but their lack 
of mental strength prevents them from reaching the upper echoleons of 
tekken-dom. During his free time, these players spend 100s of dollars 
just on Tekken to improve their skillz and when they are finally broke 
rely to TZ to post funny stuff.

4.5 The Chinky-Eye's
These are great players, who just lack that something else you need to 
be a champion. They are very willing to learn and teach what they know. 

5. Expert (aka Tekken Master)
Oh come on, you don't need me to elaborate anymore bout this do you? 
Well an expert will probably pull out all the stops on you. He probably 
knows each and every move in the game and will use them to their 
fullest of capability. Even seemingly useless moves will be utilized by 
them at the right time. An expert will be able to perform out all kinds 
of juggles, some seemingly impossible. He plays both a good turtling 
and pitbulling game, knowing when to switch between the two styles, 
often confusing his opponent. My observation has led me to conclude 
that experts have extremely good movement during battle. They bob, 
weave, sidestep, haha step, wave dash etc. just to get that single 
opening to finish you off. A battle between to expert usually comes 
down to the psychological battle. When facing an expert, your best bet 
is to pray hard that he doesn't cream you in 10 seconds flat.

******************************************
Character Specific Strategy (Vs. Strategy)
******************************************

These Character Specific Strategys will work against another player of 
similar skill as yours. Even though some characters may be rated Easy 
or Hard it doesn't mean anything if your opponent is an expert or a 
button mashing punk. Although some characters may be better against 
others, in good hands any character can be deadly. I disagree with 
statements saying in a masters hand this character is more dangerous 
than others, its just a matter of how the player plays it. Just 
remember that the ratings here are not a true representation of what a
player can do with him/her.

Alex/ Roger
Difficulty : Easy
Hmm... why would ANYONE want to play Alex/Roger? This is basically King 
from Tekken 1 without his multi throw capability (but then multithrows 
are kinda useless at a higher level of play). Beating Alex/ Roger 
should be rather easy if you play all out offense and cream him. Right, 
still, you should not take things for granted. Alex/ Roger are very 
well known for their guard stun moves. After a f,N+1 or any combo 
ending with this move, they are guaranteed an Animal Godfist which takes
off a good 50 points of damage. *ouCh*. Other things to watch out for 
is of course King's d+1,N+2 pokes. Since Alex/ Roger do not have as 
many throws as King's, and their throw range further hamper them, you
can bet most players will be going for the Giant Swing (escape : 1 , 
can be tech rolled for half damage) and the occasional Tombstone 
Piledriver. Alex/ Roger may seem like pushovers in the first place, but
played correctly, these cute, fuzzy lil creatures can put some hurt on
you.

Angel/ Devil
Difficulty : Easy ~ Medium
Angel/ Devil is a favourite choice among players who know a limited 
repertoire of moves. Well well, they actually think that Angel/Devil's 
laser is some sort of messiah. Just duck the standing laser (or if they 
are actually STUPID enough to use it in close, duck it and Demon Gut 
Punch or Gut Punch him for being such a fool) and run behind him when 
he flies high for the air laser. Beware that Angel/Devil has a fake out 
where he will dash to the other side before firing the laser, but this 
shouldn't be a problem as it is easily telegraphed.
However, at a hands of a good player, Angel/Devil can be rather 
dangerous because he HAS all the Mishima trademark moves (shining fist, 
WGF, Hell Sweeps, TGF) AND the SS+2, Devil Twister (especially if Devil 
is teamed with Heihachi). Be extra careful not to be hit by the Devil 
Twister as it could spell a LONG painful juggle.

Anna Williams 
Difficulty : Hard
Be prepared to be assaulted by a bombardment of pokes. Anna is as mean 
as her sister when it comes to poking so counter appropriately and only 
when you have an opening. Among her pokes are d+4,1, d+3,2 <launches>, 
d+1,N+4 and her new uf+1<3. Good Anna players will more than likely use 
uf+1<3 a LOT. Look out for them to delay the bad habit kick for a CH. 
Most important to note is that if the bad habit kick hits, then f+1+2
is Guaranteed. They could also probably do uf+1 and throw (most likely 
uf+1+2 but that can be tech rolled so easily) uf+1, df+2. Another 
tactic to watch out for is Anna's roll dash. Speaking of teching 
uf+1+2 throw, be aware that your opponent may tag in with a tag dive.
To avoid the tag dive, you have to tag out at the right moment. Off her 
roll dash she can do her Multi, her flip kick and her new QCT+1. Her 
multi is easily breakable though. Be prepared for her high moves like 
QCT+1 and high jabs and counter with 'You-Know-What'.... NO NO NO... 
Twin Pistons! Good players will usually delay the QCT+1 until the VERY 
LAST MINUTE, so do not duck too early or they will go into their flip 
kick. If QCT+1 is blocked, you will be slightly stunned and she will 
continue to poke poke and poke. 
Also, worth mentioning is the damage potential off a single CH QCT+1. I 
did not know Anna could do THAT Much damage. It is so unfair, but I 
guess thats the price you pay for being careless. Her SS game is pretty 
useful too as she has a SS+2 (low) and SS+1+2 (mid) Off a CH SS+2 you 
will get juggled again. Lastly, know the breaks for her multis. There 
is nothing worse than taking unnecessary damage even though you know 
which throw she is going for.

Armor King
Difficulty : Medium ~ Hard
If you go into a fight using all the tactics that you'd use to fight 
any King, you will get a sorry ass kicking. Although he has a lot of 
King's grapple (including some of his own) Armor King is played very 
very differently (a huge mistake made by a lot of people whom I have 
seen play Armor King). I mean why wouldn't one use his version of the 
WGF (called Dark Uppercut or something) which although isn't as good as 
yours is deadly in its own right. However, one should noe be afraid of 
A. King's CD mixups since they are pretty worthless. His CD moves all 
can be avoided high except for his multi throw which comes out so slow 
and easily duckable. Do watch out for his CD+1 though since this move 
comes out rather quick and puts you in a position for a guaranteed 
mounted punches (or the extremely cheap A.K. Cuffs which does zilch 
damage) 

*TIP* if your opponent is idiotic enough to try the Cuffs on you, walk 
over to him and give him a punch in Real Life.

Since Armor King has only ONE multi throw (pretty dumb for someone who 
taught the real King his moves) learn the breaks for it as you may get 
caught in it if you were on the take and couldn't avoid it. Other moves 
to look out for inlude his db+4 kick which comes out deceptively but is 
great as an okizeme attack. His Toll Kick, b+3 is a good move which he 
will use to punish moves because it comes out really fast and has good 
range. Think of this as King's b+4 disgraceful kick except it does less 
damage at the cost of speed. One last thing to be wary of is A. King's 
European uppercut (WS+1) which although has small range has special 
properties on Clean Hit and CH. Overall, A. King has an impressive 
arsenal and that topped up with his excellent throws like G. Swing 
indeed makes him a formidable opponent(read more about that in King's 
strategy) Oh did I forget to mention that he has a great 
poking game with his d+1,N+2?
 
Baek Do San
Difficulty : Easy
Baek Do San is another unpredictable character. He can either be really
hard to fight against or very easy. Baek players will usually go into
their flamingo stance and from there force you to guess whether it they
are going for the Cannonball throw (F+2~3 in flamingo), df+2 uppercut,
more punches or kicks, the kicks notably can stun on CH. So how does he
go into flamingo stance? Well there are a few popular ways like WS+
4,4,3~(F_B), SS, b+3, and of course 1,2,3~(F_B). I'd like to bring your
attention to WS+4,4,3_3~(f_b), Albatross, which has a lot of range in
it and Baek will use it a lot to play a keep away game against you. Do
not try to interrupt even with d+1 after WS+4,4 lest you get stunned by
the 3 kick. I find a lot of good players using WS+4,4 a LOT and most of
them usually do it from CD. If you managed to download those huge
Freebaek movies, you'd be able to see how he just practically ABUSES
WS+4,4. As such, you unfortunately will end up having to play a turtle
game at times so be prepared to break the cannonball throw with 1+2.
The throw does good damage puts some space in between you and him to
set up his keep away game. He can opt to tag out to Hwoarang after this
throw, for one of the coolest tag throws in the game. In this case,
Hwoarang will be next to you and gets to set up some okizeme attacks.
Moreover it can be very hard for Kazuya players to interrupt the
constant barrage of punches since Baek players can also go into
flamingo and into d+1. It would be easy for me to advice you to play a
bulldog game but lets not forget the good sidestep game Baek players
has with their double/ triple sidestep which allows them to get behind
their opponent with ease. I have warn Kazuya players here about
excessive punch strings because Baek is one of the characters with
a punch parry. His Punch parry, b+1+2 is IMO the BEST in the game (yes
better than Bryan's if you are wondering) because it executes rather
quick (11 frames), gives him 15 frames of advantage if he manages to
parry something (good enough for a guaranteed throw) and if he
wiffs leaves him vulnerable only for 11 frames. The best thing about
the parry though is that it can be cancelled into flamingo. Oh and one
last thing... don't ever think that Baek is vulnerable when he is in
flamingo because he CAN punch parry out of flamingo. Just a reminder,
Baek does have a class one launcher in the Wing blade (f,n,d,df+3)
which juggles higher than most class 1 launchers. Of course the move is
so slow that you have enough time to go take a break before
interrupting with d+1. Lastly watch out when he uses SS, flamingo 
cancel into f+2~1 throw since he wants to mix up between the double 
break f+2~1 throw and the 1 break Cannonball Side throw which can be 
tagged out for damaging follow ups.

Bruce Irvine
Difficulty : Hard 
My partner of choice! Bruce is deadly because his juggles are so easy 
to do yet extremely damaging. A juggle with his triple Knee combo (aka 
Cheese Knees) can easily see of 50% of your life in one sitting. Bruce 
has an excellent poking game with the Gatling Gun Combo 3,2,1 which 
pops you into the air and the last two hits are guaranteed if the 3 hits 
on CH. This happens a lot since his legs are long, it comes out fast 
and has insane priority. As my friend Han Tzen said "His legs are just 
so f!@#ing long."  However, since 3,2,1 and most of Bruce's other 
strings are very linear and do not track well, just sidestep sidestep 
and sidestep. Punish the wiff with a WGF. In close, Bruce's Melee game 
is not as good as yours. With that said, his punches are fast and his 
basic uppercut (df+2)cannot be reversed. Fortunately though, Bruce's 
hands are on the short side and he really needss to get 'in-your-face' 
if most of his punch attacks are going to connect.  Watch out also for 
Bruce's hopkick (uf+4) which is certainly one of the faster ones in the 
game. You can be sure, your opponent will use it to punish a careless 
tag in. IMO, his hopkick payoff rivals Julia's for the damage potential 
after it. Again, his longer legs gives him a small advantage. His Knee 
launcher (b,F+4)which although on the slow side to come out does quite 
some damage and sets you up for more knees than you can ever imagine. 
Lastly be aware that Bruce has an auto punch reversal which is done 
f,f+2 (thats the Mach Punch) If you are not careful with your punches 
you are going to hear a CRUNCH sound soon after. Also he has the 
(1),2,d+4 / (1),2,4 which confuses the hell outta you. Play smart 
against a good Bruce player and do NOT be too hasty when he gets you 
outside Melee range because 3,2,1 and Cheese Knees ain't purty.

Bryan Fury
Difficulty : Hard
Bryan is one of the best characters in the game, ranked Tier 2 and is a
superb fighter in terms of pure power. If you think that Kaz's WGF,4 
combo is too easy for the damage they do well think again. Imagine a 
simple combo like uf+4, d+2, F+4,3,4 well just EATS away at your life 
bar. And lets not forget all those stun combos like WS+3 (CH), b+1, d+
2, 1~4,(3),3 and you will soon get the idea of what is up with Bryan. 
You just can't afford to make a mistake against bryan just like against 
Jin or Bruce since he will make you pay very very dearly. Anyways Bryan 
has a very good CD or in his case rolldash mixup game. Off his Roll 
dash he can perform his Knee (WS+3_QCF+3) Uppercut which seems more 
like a class 1 launcher even if it is a class 2 launcher (WS+1_QCF+1), 
gut punch into fisherman slam (WS+2,F_B+2 or QCF+2,F_B+2) or every 
one's favourite throw C.O.M (chains of Misery) Be prepared to break COM 
with 1+2. Also his new move b+1 can be tag buffered. If blocked Bryan 
gets a huge frame advantage, long enough for him to get a free 1~4 or 
1,2 punch. If it hits, you will be sent bouncing on the floor and 
cannot tech roll. Just think of the possible damage he could do b+1~5 
to P.Jack tag in Stomp. Not necessarily guaranteed but.. OUCH! You can 
of course sidestep this move and punish him because this move comes out 
a bit on the slow side. d+2, the gut uppercut, is another new move of 
his and is used to set up a lot of things, namely C.O.M., his WS moves, 
uf+4 or continue with his other pokes. Speaking of Pokes, bryan has a 
very heavy arsenal of it in 1,2,1,2_3 , 3,2,1,4_2 mixups. Occasionally 
he may use b+3 since it does have good reach but if he continues the 
other part of the b+3 string (b+3,2,1) remember to duck and punish him. 
As mentioned against Bruce it is vital that Kazuya does not just rush 
into him like pitbulls always do and pepper him with punches because he 
too has a punch reversal, and unlike Bruces, I feel that His is more 
effective. Left punch reverses into Mach punch and right punch reverses 
into the Vulcan Punch which gurantees f,f+4 snap kick into df+3. (note: 
WGF cannot be parried... REJOICE) He also has moves like the QCB+2 
(backsway into uppercut) which is good to punish people and 1+2 which 
has evasive properties. Though Bryan lacks low attacks, he does have 
df+3, a low sweep which JUGGLES. This move is highly telegraphed and 
can be blocked easily as long as you keep half your mind on the game. 
Block or parry it (doesn't matter really but I always like to parry it) 
and punish him accordingly. Problem is good players like to move around 
and suddenly come out with the sweep. Do remember that even when Bryan 
ducks so low, he still CAN be hit by mid moves so df+2,1 or uf+4 is a 
good counter tactic. And what bout his overhead kick, uf+4? This move 
really rocked in Tekken 3 and though toned down a bit now in TTT 
(doesn't seem that toned down to me since the damage is just way too 
high) it is still the perfect move to catch people who like to do d+1 
the whole day. Well all these moves actually fail in comparison to 
Bryans power game. He just oozes in power with moves like the snap kick 
f,f+4, elbows b+2,1,2_4, f,f+3 and of course every scrubs favourite... 
the mach punch.  

Eddy Gordo/ Tiger Jackson
Difficulty : Easy ~ Medium
Scrub? Just help sweep him to death and parry all the low kicks he 
throws at you. IF however you are going up a player who KNOWS what he 
is doing, this could be tricky. Be prepared to change blocking heights 
at a dime. Since Eddy/Tiger's recovery time for moves can be bad, 
punish any blocked/parried hits with a WGF or DGP (depending on your 
position.)

Forest Law 
Difficulty : Medium
Against mashers you'd probably be having a fun time. However if you are 
up against a turtler beware. Law has many tricks up his sleeves that 
can punish you. The first card he draws is the Punch parry and its 
follow ups. You should be careful with your poking/strings. Don't get 
over predictable because you could end up at the wrong end of a 70+ 
damage juggle. On a good note, I am quite sure that Law cannot punch 
parry a WGF (anybody can confirm this?) Law is an excellent poker 
himself so be prepared for lotsa punches in your face. Law players will
almost always use standing 4 a lot since a CH 4 will gurantee him a 
juggle. He also is blessed with both a high and low parry so once again 
you must be very very careful with your moves. Law players often switch 
between b+1,2,1 and b+2,3,4 moves. Learn how to read both of them and 
parry the second low hit of the b+2,3,4. Also you must remember that 
the hits in the b+1,2,1 combo can be delayed so do not go blindly 
rushing in and eat the hits on CH (which means a float => juggle). Look 
for Law players to mix in some b+2's in their strings since it has a 
lot of forward momentum. New to TTT is his WS+2 which works in much the 
same way as Jin's WS+2 (ie comes out quick, juggles high, good range)

Last but not least, if he manages to hit you with the Poison Arrow on 
CH, remember to tag out (to cancel the stun) as he has some follow ups 
depending on his partner. Low attacks to look out for is his Low sweep 
and FC,df,d,df slide. His Low sweep can almost always be parried on 
reaction though watch for players who stop after b+1 or b+1,2 and 
sweep. The danger with FC,df,d,df slide is that players will try to 
come out of that with his WS+2 (or WS flip) though that can be blocked 
on reaction.

At the end of the day though, Forest Law gets extremely predictable as
his juggles are mainly flip, punch, Junkyard kick <rinse and repeat>

Ganryu
Difficulty : Easy 
In most cases, a big character would be a very easy kill for Kazuya
because of his ability to pitbull very well which just pounds slower 
characters to the ground. Not Ganny though because he has the right 
tools (and advantage)to beat Kazuya. However, Ganny is sort of the 
special Big characters since he does not float with some juggle 
starters (like WS+1,2) much like the other fatties YET you cannot do 
those long insane juggles that you could do on like the other fatties. 
Argh! Ganny also has a punch parry which again will screw up your game 
if you depend too much on strings involing 1,1, 1,2, df+2 etc. 
(Remember though that FORTUNATELY WGF CANNOT BE PARRIED) His punch 
parry is a weird one in that he will hop to your back (for someone that 
fat its AMAZING) and give you either a back push or a not guaranteed 
back throw. However after chatting with ChinkyEye, he has convinced me 
that Ganny depends too much on his WS+1+2, 1+2 and df+2+3. Be very 
afraid of the guard stun if the second hit of WS+1+2,1+2 hits since it 
gives him a whopping +23 frames advantage ... can you say free throw/ 
juggle? I find that my opponents like to delay the second hit. The 
guard stun opens up a huge mix up game for him. If you watched the 
Jurio Cup matches where Mr. Wizard played, you will see why since Wiz 
practically went crazy on this one move. Also his df+2+3 the low 
juggling punch is rather dangerous. It comes out rather deceptively and 
is hard to see. If it connects your opponent can get a free juggle in. 
Something from a simple uf+3+4,2 to df+2 juggles. And when it comes to 
decent low pokes, he has one in the stature kick like df+3. Great for 
okizeme as well as chipping away the life bar. Among his pokes, he has 
the classic Sumo punches in 2,1,2,1 etc which is dangerous. On CH, the 
2nd punch will give him a +12 frame advantage so that he can get in a 
free throw or set up his other attacks. Also one of his new moves, df+
2, is a great poke and juggle starter since it has evasive properties. 
Fortunately the juggles off the df+2 are rather tricky and don't do 
much damage. His other moves are basically Jack moves like the jump in 
sitdown (great for opponents who refuse to get up), sumo stomp (used 
solely in combos Im afraid) f+1+2 the clap in as well as numerous 
others. To top things up Ganny has a class 1 launcher which players 
will use prolly to catch you tagging in more than anything. I even 
forgot to give mention to his wicked unblockable. Ganny ducks down real 
low that high attacks and some mid attacks will wiff. More importantly 
the unblockable comes out very fast, CAN be cancelled into an uppercut 
and more frighteningly does a LOT of damage. Either poke him out of it 
d+1, d+2, whatever, or sidestep the unblockable. Played right, Ganny is 
a force to be feared.


Gun Jack
Difficulty : Easy
Although I have not played Gun Jack extensively (I personally like
P.Jack and Jack 2 more) Gun Jack can be dangerous in the right hands
even if he is at a severe speed disadvantage. If you are constantly
poking away with 1 and 4 you have to be very very ready to interrupt
his d+1+2 Bravo Knuckle. Although this move is very slow to say the
least, it ducks under high attacks and launches you very very high. If
Bryan is teamed with Gun Jack, then he gets a fisherman slam into
juggle.... can you say *ouCH* ? Also to watch out for is his uppercuts
which will cut through most of your standing pokes. On CH he can juggle
you and anything that Gun Jack deals is needless to say very very
damaging. But for pure CH damage, his 1,1,1 does shitloads and gives
him the spacing he needs to set up his other attacks. Remember though
that unlike most characters, his 1 is not his normal poke. Instead
Gunjack will poke with 2,(1) and occasionally when you get into the
habit of rushing in throw in the another 2 (making it 2,1,2). Also used
for poking is his df+3 which though slow is good for spacing reasons.
Again remember he is a Jack so anything that hits is bound to be high
damage. His Machine gun Knuckle (FC,db+2,2,2....) is an above average
poke (although I feel Jack2's version is much better) which is very
good to punish people who always duck low. Oh and before I forget, Gun
Jack has tons of throws which has very very good range (rivals King I
should add) which does tones of damage. You will prolly see the
Punishment drop the most (uf+1+2, d,df+2) If you fail the break the
initial throw you have the opportunity to block the follow up punch
(assuming he follows up with the punch) But with 1 frame to tap f to
block the punch, and if you fail it would count as CH, I suggest that
you very much take the damage. Other throws worth noting is his
Tombstone Piledriver (db,f+1+2) which is his most damaging throw of all
and gurantees him some okizeme and of course his modified catapult
which is a good juggle setup. His unblockables are nothing to sneeze
about too... well his wind up punch at least. Good players will use
this move occasionally only they will prolly make only one wind up
before punching you. The Wind up punch will be used often as to catch
tagging in opponents or attack immediately when you wake up. His low
sweep punch to deathfist (well looks like a deathfist to me) is used
occasionally. His trip punch (df+2+3) much like Ganny is another move
you should look out for a lot since it comes out deceptively (but slow
enough for you to block on reaction) and worst gives him good
opportunity for a juggle. Personally against the Gunjack, Kazuya should 
just play good old offense and pitbull him to death.

Heihachi Mishima
Difficulty : Medium ~ Hard
This old fart is actually still around? Since he takes damage like an 
old man (dohhh!!!) a juggle or two should see him off in no time. This 
is almost a mirror match.... well almost as I said. Although Heihachi 
has the multiple enders to his Hellsweep, his hell sweep is so pathetic 
now that it doesn't trip on the first hit. So unless you are retarded 
or something, block low even if the first hit of his hell sweep 
connects. True good players will just do one sweep and go into the 
rising kick for 50 pts of damage as bluu pointed out, but if your 
reactions are razor quick, you will be able to spot the Rising Kick 
from the distance, and block it. If the Hell Sweep hits on CH, then, 
well I'm sorry you are in for a juggle.  
Hei has been blessed with an EWGF and is really the Juggle King of TTT.
There is nothing like a good Hei player who can do those insane juggles 
off an EWGF. EWGF, EWGF, f+1,b+2,1 is nothing to laugh about doing 
something around 70 damage. Worst is if your opponent masks the Demon 
Uppercut with a CD or Wave dash and juggles you off it. *oucH* 
New to Heihachi is WS+2 which works in the same way as the DGP but 
comes out slower, has better range, does good damage and for reasons 
that have no reasonable explanation is INESCAPABLE. Now why did Namco 
do that? Isn't a damn EWGF for Hei good enough? Anyways since Heihachi 
is after all a Mishima, most of the strategy's here will apply (CD, 
Wave steps, WGF's, yada yada yada). Keep up the full offense on him and 
Heihachi will be dead in no time.

Hwoarang 
Difficulty : Easy ~ Medium
Again, fighting Hwoarang can be tricky if you are up against a master 
(but then I guess fighting against even Kuma would be hard against a 
master). Against a beginner, duck the last hit of Hwoarang's 3,3,3,3 
combo and d+4,4 and tag him with a Demon Gut Punch. IMO , Hwoarang has 
the best movement in the game, as he can easily sidestep behind you and 
give you a nice kick in the back. Hwoarang has many strong moves, but 
most of them come out slowly, so poke him out of the act. 
I'd say becareful of players who use the technique known as Crazy Step. 
Hwoarang will appear to be dancing all over the ring. His movement will 
help Hwoarang evade a lot of high attacks and make a lot of other 
attacks wiff. Don't blindly go charging in with a WGF because it may 
well miss and he will reply with a f,n,d,df+4 + juggle or just one of 
his powerful kicks *ouch!* Lastly, don't underestimate Hwoarang's 
punching abilty because a good player should and WILL use his punches 
to its full capability. Since Hwoarang doesn't have many good moves 
which actually hit low, exploit this weakness!

Jack 2
Difficulty : Easy
The rating here can be very misleading. The reason I rated Jack 2 as
easy is because Kaz has more advantage over him due to his speed and
Jack's size. However do not assume that Jack 2 is a walk in a park. In
fact he is anything but that. Jack2 has of course 10 frame pokes in his
2,1,(2). Usually these pokes are used for him to play keep away games
since they have good range. f+1+2, df+2 is also another move which
knocks you far away even when blocked. His foot stomp, f,f+3 is used a
lot! When blocked it causes a huge guard stun so that he is able to set
up his next move. As an okizeme attack, it is great too not to mention
a great tag juggle finisher for class 4 launchers. His Windup punch
hcf+2, equally is great to set up his throws because of the INSANE
guard stun. Throws? He has a multitude of them. However I will just
mentioned the most common ones = db,F+1+2 tombstone piledriver and
df,df+1 modified catapult. Tombstone does insane damage on its own but
he also has okizeme opportunity. Modified catapult does very lil damage
on its own (30 points) but the ability to juggle of it speaks volumes.
He can do a simple d+1+2 Bravo Knuckle and tag out for a tag dive, f+3+
4 ram  or the deathfist like move, Megaton Punch for oodles of damage.
Oh yeah, his f+3+4 shoulder ram, although not as good as King's (due to
poorer range) does insane damage plus leaves him safe. Since I have
already covered his Bravo knuckle when discussing GunJack, I won't
repeat it here again. Due to his size and difficulty to juggle, use WGF 
a LOT. If ever f+1+2 against Jack 2 (and other big characters) go for 
the jugular with B+1+4 unblockable. Use your pokes to continually place 
pressure on him. Overall though, fighting Jack 2 is a matter of 
spacing. If you manage to keep the pressure onyour opponent in close 
without allowing space and giving him the frame advantage, you already 
have half the match won.

Jin Kazama
Difficulty : Hard
Jin is one of the hardest characters to beat if played in the hands of 
a master. When played right, he has no apparent weaknesses. Jin is a 
mix between Jun and Kazuya, but playing in the style of either will 
result in a quick victory for you. Although Jin must have learnt 
everything wrong from his father and mother, he has some excellent 
moves of his own. His WS+2 uppercut launches you high into the air for 
some meaty juggles, while his b,f+2 gut punch while not as good as 
yours can lead to some devastating juggles. However, Jin is not without 
his weaknesses as stated because his (E)WGF pathetically hits high 
which means that any time he crouch dashes, block low. Even if he 
decides to go into the tsunami kicks, you will lose some health but not
put in a total disadvantage. After crouching his WGF, you know what to 
reply with right? The problem is good Jin players will never EWGF for 
no reason, so if you do see a EWGF coming, you know its because you 
just got yourself countered... big time damage. The major problem 
though with Jin is the effective use of CD cancel into WS+2/ Hell 
sweeps mixups. If you know your opponent is one who can utilize the WS+
2/ Hell sweep mixups, then its going to be a tough guessing game. My 
advice is to stick on him like glue and close the distance down so that 
he does not get the opportunity to start CD. However this would be 
tough for someone like Kazuya. Of course you could use the same cheezy 
strategy as him (ie CD cancel into WS+1,2 and hell sweeps mixups)
 
The thing about Jin though is that his combos are easy to do and 
extremely damaging. A scrubby combo like WGF, 1, b,f+2,1,2 takes off 
loads so needless to say an expert can even make you pay more for a 
mistake. Although his Hell sweeps isn't as good as yours because it 
hits low and then mid (compared to yours which hits twice low) <Please 
spank me for mistaking Jin's second Hell sweep for hitting High, 
everyone knows it hits mid so thanks bluu for pointing that out>, if it 
trips, he can do a lot of damage off it (say something like b,f+2,1,2, 
f,f+2) For Okizeme, b+4 is excellent and if that hits you on CH, again 
you are in trouble... Big time damage. He also has other options in his 
White Heron combo which juggles you as long as you move just a bit. 

It is also Okizeme where Jin excels over his father by a mile. Although 
at the surface Jin may seem to have thesame okizeme options as his dad, 
it is completely different because of his WS+2... yes the rising 
uppercut. It is with this move that Jin is able to use OB trap to such 
effectiveness. For those who do not know what it is, OB trap is 
basically stands for Okizeme Back trap. Basically your opponent tempts 
you to rise and then interrupts your rising animation with a d+1 which 
backturns you. To get a better idea do download Tommy vs Shauno 2 
semifinal match at Electriccancel.com and see how he uses it to great 
effect. Jin players will usually trip you using a single hell sweep. He 
will then wiff a df+4 and knowing sensing that you are going to rise 
with an attack, immediately do d+1. Since d+1 is but 8 frames, it will 
interrupt the animation of your attack hence backturning you and giving 
him a free WS+2 and juggle. Of course Kazuya has the this trick too, 
but what makes Jin more formidable is again his juggling capabilities 
as well as the good range of WS+2 (Kaz's twin pistons has the tendency 
to wiff at maximum distance so that will be a Ling BK 4 + juggle to 
you) Other ways a good player might set up the OB trap is jumping over 
you while you are down and do d+1. All I can say is be very careful and 
do not stupidly rise and attack if your opponent wiffs a move because 
most of the time (assuming he is a good player) wiffs it on purpose to 
bait you into his trap.Even with his weaknesses, Jin is a very 
formidable opponent when played correctly.

*note* If Jin is teamed up with Heihachi, he will have the opportunity 
to turn into Devil Jin after a force block (b+1+2) In this form, Jin's 
body is surrounded with electric. Along with a new string, Jin's WGF 
will now hit Medium and juggles you higher.

Julia Chang 
Difficulty : Very Hard
Of all the characters I have played against, IMHO I think that Julia is 
the hardest fighter to fight against. WHY? For one, Julia is very fast, 
has good power and knock the wind out of you from the start of the 
match if you aren't ready. She has loads of mixups from almost every 
position : standing (CH) 1~2,1 or 1~1,4,3 (and others) - scrubby 
tactics -, Crouching FC,df+2 or FC,df+4,3. Because she has a quick jab, 
you have to be really careful with your poking game. Remember your 10 
frame jabs will always lose out to her 8 frames jab, and being that on 
CH, she can get a 1~2,1 you'd soon learn to be careful. If you are a 
psychic, be ready to parry any of her low shots she throws. Always 
parry the 2nd hit of her 4,4,4_d+4_1 combo or you could be left with a 
guessing game later whether to block high or low. Hit df the minute you 
see the 1~2,3_4 combo (scrubby combo again)because it will parry the 
low 3 kick and go under the high 4, unless of course your opponent got 
you on CH and you are flying high in the sky after the Sky uppercut. 
Beware also of her d,df+1<2 and WS+2<2 as players may delay the 2nd hit 
hoping to get a CH. d,df+1<2 in particular is a very abused move. They 
will do the first d,df+1 and delay it for a CH or stop there and throw 
you (Mad axes of course) or just stop and start a new string.

If your opponent is foolish enough to finish the 1~1,1 combo on a non 
CH (though I have NEVER seen good players go for 1~1,1 as they'd opt 
for 1~2,1) , punish them with a jab at very least or best yet a Mist 
step cancel WGF... you just have about enough time. Julia has very good 
SS ability and coupled with her lil spin move (3+4) she can get behind 
you before you know it. Watch out for her Mad Axes throw (QCB<F+2) 
where she can sidestep after the QCB motion. Remember the break for 
this throw is 1+2. However, ducking this throw is much better than 
trying to break from it *duH* because the escape window is extremely 
small and the range is pretty good. 
I think that Julia is also good at time wasting because after a 
float she can waste LOADS of precious time with her multiple elbow 
juggles which do about as much damage as a swat at a fly. Whatever you 
do, be ready to change your blocking height or you could be at the 
wrong end of her damaging juggles.

Jun Kazama
Difficulty : Easy
If you haven't fought against a Jun player before, you could be in some 
trouble. Jun is an infinite stringer and if you don't know her well you 
could be blocking and taking hits all day from the get-go. I suggest 
playing as Jun for some time just to learn her infinite strings because
if you do not know where to block and counter you are going to be in 
some trouble. With that said, even if you haven't played her before, 
most of her moves are rather slow and are easily interrupted. One move 
to be REALLY careful about is her Can-can Kicks which hits low and 
comes out of no where. However the Can-Can kicks has been toned down a 
lot and is probably worthless now in TTT. Jun's best move in the game
now is prolly her standing 2 which juggles ANY character big or small
dumb or smart for a white heron combo.
Any move with slow recovery will probably be answered with Jun's Tooth 
Fairy (F+2) into a juggle. On the other hand, her Tooth fairy itself 
has the very poor recovery time itself so WGF after you have blocked it.
Of course, Jun's juggles aren't that damaging. Jun is the most 
ideal fighter to practise low parrying (df) against since a lot of her 
attacks hit low and come out slow. Remember to buffer chicken for your 
moves because Jun is one of the few characters blessed with a reversal. 
Watch out for her WS+3 since it has really good speed and priority. 
Jun's Sidestep Kick (SS+4) is also another move to look out for. On CH 
she is guaranteed a 3+4 cartwheel kick. One good thing to note though is 
Jun's SS+4 hits high so if you know its coming DUCK.
Other things you should be aware of with Jun is her SS+2<1+2_b+2<1+2.
Most Jun players will initiate the first punch and delay it hoping
to get you should you try to retaliate. Scrubby players might abuse
her b+1 sparrow trap a lot. On CH it is an automatic reversal. Teach 
him (or her) a lesson by sidestepping and WGF. Occasionally Jun 
players use her 1+2 in close to catch you off guard. If it hits, its
an unescapable stun, but the good thing is the move is on the slow 
side. If Jun players are to throw, then I guess there is only one throw
which is on their mind - b+1+2. This throw does around 30 points of 
damage but is a 2 button escape throw which is so easy to initiate. 
Watch for Jun players to abuse this throw a lot. Jun's f,f+2 is 
somewhat like Jin's Demon's Paw but it lacks power. In turn it makes up 
with a built in sidestep ability. This in turn makes this move a good 
move to use when you are busy barraging with the same constant strings.
Last of all, is her standing 4 and like most characters, her standing 4
will juggle on CH which leads to a White heron juggle.
Overall though, Jun starts getting predictable once you know her 
strings, and her poor stamina makes the job easier for you. =)

Kazuya Mishima
Difficulty : How good are you?
You've read the FAQ, so now is the time to pit your skills against 
another fellow Mishima.

King 
Difficulty : Medium
Played in the right hands, King can be a big thorn in your ass. He has 
a good poking game, d+1,N+2 , df+1,2 and 2,1 but the most important of 
the poking tools is d+1,N+2 which comes out incredibly fast and the 
first hit is low. Hey its an 8 frame move and it does decent damage. 
Mishima's should be aware of this move alone because it by itself is a
Mishima killer. He also has the most extensive list of very damaging 
throws including a throw which will grab you from crouching position. 
Particular throws to watch out for is his Giant Swing and Tombstone 
Piledriver as well as his multithrows. Giant Swing is one of the best 
throws in the game (second IMO only to Julia's Mad axes). People may 
say that G. Swing is pretty useless because it takes only a 1 button 
escape and the throw itself can be tech rolled for half the damage. BIG 
DEAL! G. Swing has immense range and has a really really really small 
escape window. Moreover, 35 damage is still good damage and even some 
of the best players will mess up the tech roll in the heat of battle. 
Tombstone is another throw to look out for since it does nice big 
damage, gurantees a free ground throw attempt (you can break out of it 
of course) and can be done out of a side step ala Julia's Mad Axes. 
Another thing is his multis. Most people say that Multis are pretty 
useless at a high level of play because it is easily broken. I do not 
agree (watch the World Champs finals to see what I mean) because King's 
multis have different routes plus he can always bluff his throws. Look 
at his hands but be cautious if he is trying to bluff a throw (he will 
do a command and then stop and start the command of a another throw)
Knowing his multi escapes is good, but if you have not taken the 
trouble to memorize them (big mistake) then, just mash 1 or 2 and hope.
From his sidestep, he can do the Deadly Bommerang which is HELL 
damaging or start his multi throw. His b+4 disgraceful kick can be 
dangerous and most often used as a counter. From the BK position he can 
pull off his Lariat unblockable *ouch* or his new BK+3 mule kick which 
is irritating. As long as you stay out of his throw range and punish 
him everytime he wiffs a throw, King isn't all that tough. Overall, 
King is a good fighter when played right, but since the removal of the 
guaranteed Giant Swing after his 2,1 , King is no longer a "cheater" 
character. I guess other noteworthy moves of King to watch out for is
his Shoulder ram, f+2+3 and the flying body press f,f+2+3 both of which
are very very useful power moves to catch people tagging in. With King,
his big size does allow for him to use u+4 hopkick (instead of uf+4 
with most characters) to juggle opponents since his big size and reach
allows the combos to hit except for at full range. Look for good king 
players to punish you (and poke you occasionally) with his 1+2, 2. 

Kuma/Panda
Difficulty : Easy
Ok, so Kuma may not be as pathetic as the Jacks, but he is damn near. 
He is a big target and slow to boot which makes poking and juggling so 
much more fun. However, as I said, he isn't as pathetic as the Jacks 
because he has the G-clef Cannon move of the Changs (performed f+1~1,1) 
which could juggle you for some huge damage. The first punch of his G-
Clef is 8 frames so you should be very careful with your jabs. Also, 
since his hands are long, you'd probably get punched after a blocked 
WGF. However other than that, Kuma won't be a huge threat to you.

Kunimitsu
Difficulty : Medium
Again, there aren't any good Kuni players in my arcades and I am still 
in the process of learning how to play Kuni so I can't write much about 
this. Basically Kuni is a Yoshimitsu clone with some moves to call her 
own. Her d/f+2 uppercut isn't as good as Yoshimitsu but you should not 
underestimate it because she can do some mean juggles off a single 
uppercut. Kuni has a move where she disappears into the ground and 
comes flying out of the air with an unblockable Sai attack (u+1+2) 
which she can mix up with the fake. Though this unblockable can be 
easily seen a mile away, if you actually get caught in it you will be 
juggled. Kuni's most dangerous weapon however is her okizeme tactics 
which is up there with the best. She can keep you on the floor all day 
with moves such as her D,df+3,3,3,f+4, poison wind (uf+3+4) and if you 
move she can nail you with an unblockable (b+2 or f,f,(N)+2. Do not 
underestimate Kuni even though she is said to be inferior than you are.

Lee Chaolan
Difficulty : Easy ~ Medium
Finally, after playing Lee for sometime (and funny I took so long to 
choose him since my surname too is Lee) I have got some ideas of how to 
face at least an intermediate Lee opponent. Mind you, my Lee isn't 
really that good, and I would welcome anyone out there to send in vs 
Lee strats to me. One thing is for sure though, Lee is not Law even 
though he has a lot of his moves.
Most Lee mashers like to do the stupid Inifinite Kick string. Block the 
first few kicks and then punish them when you have the space. Either 
that or just abuse d+1 like you would abuse WGF on any other day. Lee 
has a Class 1 tag launcher (d,db+4) which, like all Class 1 launchers, 
you should be extra careful of. Goodplayers though will not rely very 
much on d,db+4 since it comes out on the slow side and will only use it 
to punish a slow recovering move or a stupid tag in. They will rely 
more on Lee's Hop Kick and df+2. The thing with Lee though is the fact 
that a lot of people underestimate his juggling prowess. This may be 
true as most of his intermediate combos do very minimal damage, but if 
your opponent is the master of f,f,N+3,4,4, then you could be in a bit 
of trouble. Lee does have a very good, no-damage move in his Mist step. 
Done by inputting f,N, his version of a Mist step moves him forward, 
all the while, while keeping his guard up. Of course a low attack will 
break up his intentions. At intermediate level, players try to mix up 
f,f,N+3,4,4with f,f,N+3+4 for a 'guess high or low' game, since both 
start off exactly the same. Poking with Lee usually involves his 4,4... 
kicks which has good range and speed, d+3,3 and 1,2. d+3,3... is rather 
cheesy since if the d+3 hits on CH, the rest of it is guaranteed, and 
you'd be surprised how often that will get you if you aren't careful. 
When Lee does his FC,df+4 and wiffs, remember not to blindly rush in if 
he is partnered with Kazuya since he can follow up with 2~2~1 
unblockable and a subsequent free hit. 
Although Lee may seem a weak opponent at first, he has the right moves
for the right situation to counter anything that you can dish to him.
So do not always underestimate your opponent if he chooses Lee.

Lei Wulong
Difficulty : Medium / V.Hard
I don't think Lei is that difficult if you have enough experience 
playing against Lei players. Lei is the master of stances and you must 
know each and everyone of them as well as the moves from which they can 
perform from the stance. Lei has some rather powerful moves but most of 
his moves come out slow and easily interrupted. Also, from his stances, 
most of his moves either hit High or Medium bar a few moves. Even then, 
those moves are slow enough for you to block on reaction. Lei also has 
some moves and stances which will evade/parry attacks. Take for 
instance his drunken headbutt (b+1+2) where he will take a step back 
before delivering a headbutt. You have to becareful when charging in 
because he could easily evade the attack you were trying to dish to him 
and land you a blow on a CH. 
When ever Lei goes from his punch rushes into one of his stances, d+1
immediately. The last thing you want is to have a guessing game with 
Lei because he has a very good guessing game in all his stances. 
Anyways here are just some general strategies for Lei when he is in a
particular stance.
1) Snake : 
He has 2 noteworthy moves here, 1,1,1,1,1 (the quick jabs) and 2,2,2 
which is 2 mid swipes into a low swipe. Lei players will prolly use
2,2,2 a lot after db+4 sweep but watch for them to use 2,2 to induce
you to retaliate, after which they will follow up with f,n,4,1,2,3
or b+1+2,drunken headbutt for massive damage.
2) Dragon :
If any Lei player goes ino Dragon and tries the grab, Duck and punish
him with Twin pistons. If he tries 1+2 and you block it, your best bet
is to continue blocking because he will most likely follow up with a
drunken headbutt. In DRG, Lei has 4,1,2,3. If 4 connects in CH, then 
the rest is guaranteed. Look for Lei players to bait you and then go for
the CH. One particular example would be blocked SNK 2,2 which then goes
to DRG. From there, if you even attempt anything stupid, he will CH you 
and that does shit loads of damage.
3) Panther
This is where Lei starts to get really frightening. In panther he has
a mix up of low (in 1) or mid (in 2) I really have no advice as to tell
you where to block but lets just say I hope you get lucky. If 1 hits
then Lei is guaranteed a WS+3_4 and if 2 hits he is guaranteed any normal
juggle like he would off a hopkick.
4) Tiger
Another dangerous position for you. In Tiger, Lei has another guessing
game. Duck and he will give you an overhead swipe and stun you which 
then screams HOPKICK. Stand and block and Lei will give you a sweep in
the forms of 4 and follow that up with a 4~4,3,3.
5) Crane
Neither is this a good stance for you. Watch for the low kick to catch 
you tagging in. This move has really good range. The phoenix power
punch is prolly another good move since it disorientates both 
characters and is a good set up for a BK d+1 low backhand swipe and
juggle. The Phoenix dance will prolly be used occasionally as an 
Okizeme attack. 

More advanced players employ a technique which is known as the 'Haha' 
step. Basically, Lei dashes back by cancelling the backturn. (b~3~4, b, 
b~3~4, b and so on) I must highlight how important it is to not dash 
blindly into a backturned Lei because he can easily come out from it 
with some razor punches. Go download the Tekken Tag Championship Finals 
movie and watch how Seok makes full use of the Haha Steps. The best you 
can do is dash into just out of his attack range, sidestep and hope 
that he commits himself to an attack by psyching him out. You could 
also use tag slides or cross chops though it is NOT a guaranteed 
solution. Other than that, your best bet is to play it save and back 
away. The HaHa step technique pratically tranforms Lei from an average
fighter to one that should be feared.

Ling Xiaoyu
Difficulty : Medium
Ling is a pest! Since my sparring partner likes to play Ling a lot (he 
likes to play really quick characters like Ling, Julia, Mich etc. ) I 
have learnt that Ling can be a thorn in Kaz's side because she can 
easily poke you out of your moves and irritate you with her parrying 
skill. Since Ling has amazing speed, you MUST be sure that your move 
will connect or you will eat irritating lil pokes which do small damage 
that WILL add up at the end of the day. More importantly though, you 
should only throw a WGF if you are sure that it will connect. Because 
of Ling's good movement, she can easily dodge your WGF and pop you with 
a juggle starter. Kaz has one of the best anti Art of Phoenix moves in 
his stature kick (db+4). When you see her go into her Art of Phoenix, 
immediately do the stature kick to knock her out of the act. Whatever 
happens do not throw moves out in fustration because of continually 
taking poke damage ESPECIALLY on a backturned Ling... she isn't as 
defenceless as you think she is. Just bear in mind that she is a lil 
girl and as such takes damage like one so be patient and wait for the 
opening. A few spanks to her will probably end the round in a jiffy.
Funny thing though is Ling has been tonned down quite a bit from Tekken 
3 (she was among the top 5 fighters IMO in Tekken 3) but yet, she still
holds her own.

Michelle
Difficulty : Hard
Using the same strats you would to play Julia to play against Michelle 
is a VERY big mistake a Tekken player can make. She plays the same as 
her daughter, but she has a few moves to call her own.  Namely the df+3
+4 and SS+3~4, both juggle starters. Her SS+3~4 puts her sidestepping 
game in the same league as Jin and Devil even though the SS+3~4 may 
miss at times (it has to be near to be sure of connecting). Her df+3+4 
ducks under high attacks and she will use it if you are not careful 
with your pokes. A correctly timed df+3+4 can interrupt your WGF so 
this is another warning not to go throwing WGF's like crazy. Yes I know 
the WGF is very useful but she has so many other ways to punish you 
like the 1~1,1 for example. Simply put, the moves that she has are just 
way faster than any of yours. Therefore, be very careful when using 
your strings. Keep the pressure on her and do NOT let her get into her 
WS game. But if the battle gets too intense and you find that she is 
getting the upperhand, it is sometimes best to retreat and play on the 
defense. She can be extremely dangerous if you allow her to get into a 
Crouched position. One of her new moves, SS+2 is an excellent move for 
her to get into FC position without any disadvantage to her. Like 
Jules, she has loads of option from FC position. Worse though is if SS+
2 hits you (which happens often if you aren't too careful with 
pitbulling) then WS+4 is guaranteed. Speaking of WS+4 it will gurantee 
her a d+4 follow up. Previously I was mistaken by saying that after her 
WS+4 she could juggle. This is certainly not true unless you are 
talking about rolling opponents. She CAN juggle though after the 
skycraper kick off her elbow (f,f+1,4). Besides her elbows are very 
different unlike Julia since they do not knock away on CH and thus 
gurantee the Sky Scrapper kick ---> Juggle. Look for a good Michelle 
player to incorporate LOADS of elbows into his poking strategy. While I 
need not discuss more on her FC,df+2 elbow on CH. Punish a blocked bow 
and arrow kick (FC, df+4,3 or any of its variants) with a Shining fist 
or WGF (though remember that good players will never ever use follow up 
with the 3 unless the 4 connects). It is odd to say this but Kazuya is 
more effective against Mich if he plays on the defense rather than 
continue pitbulling and getting his ass CH. I have changed Michelle's 
rating from V. Hard to Hard because Mich has very poor stamina so if 
you just keep on top of her and do not allow her breathing space, she 
will be out in no time.... though hitting her may pose to be the 
biggest problem. 

Mokujin / Tetsujin
Difficulty : -variable-
Can you tell which character your opponent is playing from the start by 
just looking at the entrance animation or the way they move? If you can 
that is a good start. Mokujin / Tetsujin is as good as the character 
being used but in some cases the size factor makes it a bit different 
(Mokujin is bigger than Ling but smaller than the Jacks for example). 
You'd better be prepared to learn stances if you are to defeat an 
expert Mokujin player.

Nina Williams
Difficulty : Easy 
OK, so Nina Williams has been weakened like a LOT since Tekken 3 (she 
was my favourite character in Tekken 3 btw). A lot of her moves have 
been weakened to balance out gameplay but Nina is still a very good 
character. She has excellent poking moves (d+1,N+4 , d+4,1 etc) She can 
can easily stick in your face the whole day with her poking games and 
if you are not careful may eat a Divine Cannon on CH ->juggle -> major 
butt whupping. Her CD game can be deadly too as she can come out of it 
with an uppercut, Bad habit kick (you know the kick to the men's area) 
or go into one of her multi throws. However, her multi's aren't as 
dangerous as say King's and can be easily broken plus she will take 
damage when you break out of it. Make sure you KNOW how to break her 
multi's because they still pack major damage (though not as much as 
King's INSANE Rolling Death Cradle multi). Nina is one of the most 
complete character in the game as she has it all (throws, combos, fast 
pokes,reversals ... you name it) so be prepared for a long hard fight. 
When she is just outside throw range, throw a WGF or df+2 gut punch (or 
if you were in a FC position rise with a WS+2) the moment you see her 
move an inch because she will most probably be coming at you with her 
long, seizure inducing strings. My advice against a good Nina player is 
to psyche your opponent into wiffing a move and go for a WGF + juggle 
which is easier said then done, but at a higher level of play it is all 
down to psychology after all. Also, make full use or your side stepping 
and CD ability although you have to really careful as some of Nina's 
moves have excellent tracking ability.

Ogre
Difficulty : Medium
Ogre has moves stolen from a lot of Tekken 2 characters. Among some of 
his moves is YOUR DGP. Watch out for it because he will most likely 
follow that up with a Waning Moon throw (break : 1+2 and can be tag 
escaped) or a Hopkick juggle or a simple 4. He also has Lee Chaolan's 
d~db+4 which is a great Tag launcher. Ogre has probably one of the 
meanest Okizeme games with the inclusion of Kuni's Unblockables (b+2 
and f,f,N+2). Watch out for Lee's Infinite Kicks which is a favourite 
among scrubs. Block the first four hits at most and then retaliate. If 
Ogre uses his f,f+2, sidestep after the initial punch to avoid the 
unblockable and then counter appropriately. Ogre can poke too since he 
has your 1,1<2 and Bruce's df+1,2 (which sadly doesn't juggle). Most of 
Ogre's moves are slow, powerful and if they should connect, will almost 
always give him a frame advantage. Watch out for his other unblockables 
(he has loads of them) and poke him out of the act. As long as your 
keep the pressure on Ogre with tonnes of pokes you should do fine.

Paul
Difficulty : Easy / Medium
At least Paul has been weakened this time around so much so that his 
Falling Leaf combo will only trip if he is near or hits on counter. If 
you manage to block the sweep portion of the Falling leaf combo, 
retaliate with the Twin Pistons while he is still recovering from the 
sweep stagger. In this instance, I'd recommend the Twin Pistons over 
the DGP because this won't count as a counter hit and the resultant 
juggle from the Twin Pistons will add up to more damage. 
Good Paul players are extremely hard to find (though not as rare as 
good Eddy players) and are easily identified because they will never 
ever be stupid enough to throw Deathfists (QCF+2) at random because you 
will be able to easily poke him out of it. They only use Deathfists to 
hit on CH (which is still a bad thing...). They actually ultilize pokes 
(whoop tee dooo!!). Particularly watch out for 1,2 and 4 pokes. Good 
Paul players will use standing 4 a lot hoping for a CH into a 1,1,1, 
QCF+2 juggle. If they poke with 2,3 parry the low 3 since that is 
telegraphed. They amazingly use CD tactics to confuse you *wow!* or the 
more advanced 'lightdash' *double wow* They go for juggles with the 
hopkick (uf+3 or uf+4), QCF+1 , WS+2 etc even though Paul may not be 
the best character to juggle with, he still can deal a decent amount of 
damage. Overall though, since Paul has a limited arsenal of moves like 
you, at least you have to bear in mind that only some of his are 
particularly useful, and he will get predictable at a high levle of 
play.

P. Jack
Difficulty : Easy
I have been playing P Jack a lot lately and after extensive play with 
him I must say he has to be one of the weaker character in the game.
However thats not to say he is useless, far from it since he can 
actually hold his own. 2+4 throw is prolly the only throw a PJack 
player will use along with db+2+3 since 1+3 throw is pathetically
slow (Pjack Press) Anyways back to 2+4 throw. It has one of the 
biggest range and can (and will be) linked into b,d,db,d,df,F+2 
gigaton punch. You can actually block the punch, but since you only
have 1 frame to do so and failing to do so would mean the punch counts
on CH, my recommendation is that you just take the damage unless you 
really must take the risk (say the blow would kill you anyways) or are
very sure of your timing. Most of Pjacks moves are rather slow, but 
have good range. SS moves like SS+1+2 is a perfect example. The range 
is extremely good but the startup time is poor. For Kazuya players,
you have to get in close into Pjack and pound him senseless before he
knows what hit him. However Pjack does have a rememdy for that in 
his Glock Up. Thanks to Brahma for this nice tip, Pjack can
continously do his Glock Up (b+1+2) and cancel that with b infinitely 
to do a weird dance. If you should get caught by the force block, f+1+2 
is guaranteed. When we talk about pJack, anything guaranteed is big 
damage. Other abused stuff are 1+2<1+2 where Pjack players will delay
the second hit to hope to catch you on CH. Should a PJack player do 
Torpedo Jack f+3+4 to end a round and fail to do so, punish him 
properly for that since the recovery for the move is horrible. (Wiffing
that move will prolly gurantee you an unblockable) However this move
is great to catch people tagging out for that last sliver of life. 
Lastly, when Pjack comes tagging in, be cautious that he is the only 
Jack who can cancel his tag run in into the Stomp unblockable. If you
are too eager to attack, you will be caught out and *Crunch* there goes
a chunk of your life.

True Ogre
Difficulty : Medium
Refer to Ogre to get a basic idea of what True Ogre has in store for
you. The difference between True Ogre is he is way bigger (so most of
his attacks have added range), has that irritating flame attack (which
scrubs abuse), can't be juggled (or at least you have to get used to
the change in timing should he try to fly away) and has an unblockable
horn attack (3+4 when KND). With his added range, T.Ogre's DGP will
have more range, therefore, scoring a hit will be a little bit easier.
Not only that. Because of the added range, should T.Ogre's DGP get
blocked at the maximum distance, he is relatively safe from anything
but a quick poke. Moreover True ogre has a good WS game as he has the
FC, df+2 which hits low (the low backhand swipe which was stolen from
Anna) True ogre has moves like df+1+2 the horn uppercut which ogre does
not have. Good players will use df+1+2 a lot both as an okizeme attack
to catch players back rolling, tagging in/out and as a juggle starter.
Even though it is rather slow, the horn uppercut ducks under high
attacks, so be very careful with your poking strings. A df+1+2 juggle
takes off ass loads of damage. Also the horn unblockable has VERY good
range, and unless you time it perfectly, the horn unblockable will hit
you when tagging in even if you tag cancel. If T. Ogre is partnered
with Lei, then after Lei's 1+3~5 throw, T. Ogre is guaranteed a df+1+2  
I think. Anyways, other not so common moves to watch out for is f,f,N+3
+4 which is the same as Lee's slide, SS+4 (pure crap) Watch out for his
flame attack and remember to punish those scrubs for abusing it. Good
players do use the flame too... suprisingly... but they do so to waste
time especially when you are a full screen's distance from them. Also,
the flame attack is a very good to bait opponent. Don't go carelessly
running in because you could be at the end of df+1+2. Personally, I
like double flame at full range before bashing the rushing in opponent
with f+2. Again remember the unblockables. More unfair is you can't
juggle him properly since he can easily fly backwards to avoid
subsequent hits.DARN! As such I suggest you use strong 2 hit combos 
like the cheesy WGF,4 or the less cheesy WGF, f+2. If he is flipped 
over, then of course he cannot escape. However, T. Ogre's size is his 
main downfall since he is slow and should be played much like you would 
play Ogre - all out offense. If you manage to hit T.Ogre down, okizeme 
him to death. T.Ogres fat size is sooooooo okizeme encouraging. WWGF, 
WWGF, WWGF repeat. Oh one last thing, remember that you can always SS
after blocking f,f+2 (the semi unblockable twister attack) That move is
the ultimate scrub killer. Do what you do best.... get in close and
deny him the space that he needs. 

Wang Jinrei
Difficulty : Easy ~ Medium
Hmmm... if you thought that Heihachi being alive was impossible , this 
fella is a greater exagerration. Anyways though, I think that Wang 
should just be put to rest because his stamina is attrocious. Moreover, 
he has poor frame data. His moves are slow to recover and even slower 
to come out. Be careful though of his db+4,2 combo on CH because if the 
db+4 connects on CH, the 2 is guaranteed and leads to a very damaging 
(and easily done combo) Nothing much to worry about though since the
punch recovers like er....does it actually recover? The recovery time
is so slow you prolly can go make yourself a cup of coffee before 
coming back to WGF the scrub for abusing the move. Wang has a deathfist
too but it is no where as cheap as Paul's. Becareful when poking with 
1,1,>2 (Shining fist) as Wang has an Unchickenable Left Punch reversal 
(he can reverse other moves too but only left punches are 
unchickenable) Wang may be disadvantaged with his poor frame data BUT 
he has enough tricks to pull out of the hat to defeat you if you take 
him on lightly. Look for him to abuse SS+1+2 the heatbutt move since
that is one of the rare moves where he isn't at a frame disadvantage.
If you get caught by it, you are in DEEP shit I tell you. Oh another 
thing, don't worry about Wang's FC,df+4,3.... the 3 isn't even 
guaranteed if the 4 hits. Keep the heat on him and he will be done.

Yoshimitsu
Difficulty : Hard
Yoshi is very dangerous for many reasons. First off, he has the 
infamous df+2 uppercut which is the best basic uppercut in the game. It 
comes out fast, has good range and has insane priority. Off a single 
df+2 uppercut, Yoshi can do a juggle which will take more than 40+ life 
off of ya. Worse yet, Yoshi can tag buffer his df+2 in TTT which means
that there is 0 badv for you since there is a small guard stun and 
worse still, df+2 will juggle you even when crouched whether on CH or 
not. (normally df+2 on crouching opponents require it to be on CH for
it to launch)In TTT, Yoshi has also gained the benefit a SS moves in 
SS+1 and SS+2. SS+1 will be used the most by good players since it has 
good range, does decent amounts of damage and juggles on CH. Not to 
forget his unorthodox starter in the forms of a head/shoulder charge 
off his pogo stick stance. Yoshi players will go into pogo stance when 
you are on the ground hoping for two things i) you tag out and they 
nail you with the pogo headbutt or 2) you move (or lie around) in which 
he runs you over with the pogo stick. Although the Roo Kick (4~3) isn't 
used much by good players, be warned that IF it does connect, you are 
in a major world of hurting. Yoshi has loads of unblockables some of 
which are very useful. Yoshi's QCF+1 (flip in air with sword) is used a 
lot even by good players. Be prepared to sidestep it. If the match is 
running out of time, you can be sure Yoshi players will use the 
spinning sword attack to waste time should he be winning or do a jump-
in suicide move as a last attempt to get a Double KO if he is low on 
life anyways. I don't know how many times this has happened but players 
will freeze when Yoshi jumps in.... a simple d+1 or 1 would the the 
trick. When fighting Yoshi, its vital to be careful because he has his 
sword reversal, so don't just go charging blindly into him hoping for 
something to happen ... more than likely you will hit his sword 
instead. Yoshi's jump in Knee or Fubuki (f,f+4) which has exceptional 
speed and priority and is mostly used to punished wiffed or slow 
recovering attacks. If you do block the Fubuki though, make sure to 
punish Yoshi to the fullest because it has a long recovery time. Good 
Yoshi players also make use of the Bad Breath attack so when you do see 
Yoshi turning back ready to blow, CROUCH, and reply with the Demon Gut 
Punch or Twin Pistons. Beware of Yoshi when he goes into FC 
position because he can come out of it with a FC, df+3 which hits low 
and sets up a juggle. Speaking of going into FC position, a lot of 
Yoshi players like to make use of his low thrust (d+1+3) to deceptively
get into Crouched position. Beaware of the options that Yoshi has off
his FC (like FC,df+3 and sword sweep) One last thing, Yoshi has the 
infamous b+1+4 yoshi's flash which I reckon is the FASTEST move in the 
game.... so think twice about barraging in with a whole arsenal of 
attacks. This move is has the fastest startup at a minimal 4 frames...
THATS faster than any jab you know! Yoshi players not only like to use
the sword flash to counter Wavedashing Mishimas but also set it up with
a wiffed move which recovers moderately fast. An example would be a 
wiffed roo kick when you are on the ground or a wiffed df+2 just 
outside WGF distance.
 
***************************
Suggestion for Tag Partners
***************************

The teams that I frequently use are as below :-

1)Kazuya/ Jun
The husband and wife team. Kazuya is excellent in helping Jun out with 
her weaknesses. Admittedly, Jun is prolly one of the weakest character
in TTT, which gives all the more reason for me to play her. I guess 
pairing her up with the "God-like" Mishimas helps to even out the odds.
Jun's power lies in her ability to er.... er... humiliate her opponent
when they know they got beat by one of the game's worst character. 
Kazuya's f,f+1+2~5 to Jun Arm breaker gives her a free FC,df+2 too.

2) Kazuya/ Heihachi
Before learning to play Bruce this was my number one choice team. I 
still use this team a lot though. Since Kazuya has a WGF and better 
stamina than Heihachi, I would play with Kazuya and when I see an 
opening... WHAM... WGF~5 and Heihachi would finish the juggle for me. 
The problem with this team however is that both characters style can be 
rather similar, (I did not say exactly the same as Heihachi relies more 
on his (E)WGF while Kazuya's tactics is based on his DGP) so if your 
opponent manages to figure out how to overcome one of your character's 
tactics, you can be sure he roughly knows how to beat the other.

3) Kazuya/ Jin
Same reason as above, though this time Kazuya and Jin's strategy are 
almost the same (both rely on getting their (Demon)Gut Punch to hit on 
CH) Since Jin's WGF hits High (sM if buffered with a tag) and knocks 
too far away on CH (this does not apply if tag is buffered though) 
Kazuya's WGF can be the answer as you can call Jin in to finish the 
juggle with a simple TGF,3 or any of his b,f+2,1.... juggles. And if
you are a master of Wavedash to iWS moves... then your opponent has
a veryyyyyy slim chance.

4) Kazuya/ Julia
Elbows, elbows elbows mania... need I say more? Besides, Julia is just
a powerhouse when it comes to juggling and her stamina is pretty good 
too. All hail Mad Axes, the best throw in the game. You could probably
win a whole match by using that throw alone.

5) Kazuya/ Paul
Before you start laughing, let me tell you this - Paul RULZ if you know 
how to play him well... and No  I don't mean being able to do 10 
deathfist in a row. It is the ability to poke your opponent and then
deliver some whoop ass damage when they make a mistake. Sure Paul is
rather limited by his list of useful moves at a higher level of play
but he is rather fun to play is proven to be able to do some nice combo
damage.

Be creative when coming up with your own tag team. What works best for 
me may not work for you. Experiment a lot until you find the Tag 
partner of your choice.

*** Whatever it is I recommend you NOT play Kazuya / Devil because this 
team sux big time (it takes so freaking long to morph from one to the 
other thus spoiling tag Juggle opportunities and you are left open to 
whatever @$$ whupping your opponent has in store for you) ***


***************
Partner Rating
***************

Hmmm, I will give a rating (out of 10 )to each character. Remember, 
the partner rating is a subjective choice and most of it is a matter of 
preference.


Alex/ Roger 
2/10
No go here. These freaks are just so incompatible with Kazuya since 
they don't have good juggle ability (which Kazuya lacks) making tag 
juggles few and hard to come by. So it will almost always be a battle 
of 2 seperate characters, rather than 2 characters working as a team.

Angel/ Devil
1/10 - 8/10
Really.. I hate this team. If Devil was teamed up with Heihachi, the 
team would probably get 4*'s or more but because of the stupid 
animation where Kazuya morphs into Devil and vice versa, you can't do 
any juggles after the WGF. Same goes for Devil Twister.What a total 
waste! What more, you are so vulnerable while morphing and your 
opponent would have been charging up an unblockable to teach you a good 
lesson. However, as seperate fighters, Angel/ Devil are formidable 
given that they have the usual set of Mishima moves.
However in PS2 TTT, Kazuya can Team up with Angel, without the morphing
penalty. The catch though is Angel is of course a smaller, shorter hand
version of Devil. You can get some *CRAZY* stuff in though like Angel's
SS+2, to Kazuya's B+1+4.
*Note* There is a Bug in TTT where you can tag out with Devil to 
       Kazuya. After a SS+2 you have to run under your opponent and
       tag out at the right moment. If done correctly, Devil will rush
       out and Kazuya will tag in. Prolly follow that up with a flip
       kick.

Anna Williams
8/10
Anna has to be one of the most improved characters since Tekken 3. She 
has it all, good pokes, speed, fab juggles, nice body, multi throws, 
reversal, did I mention Nice body? Her inclusion of her QCT+1 to juggle 
makes her a character to be feared. Use her uf+1,3 a lot too! A good 
team, but one which I don't use often. Choose the zebra outfit! One 
thing to note about Anna is that after her uf+1+2 throw, you can 
usually tag out and nail your opponent with a tag dive. However, since
as stated, Kazuya does not have a tag dive, well.... your opponent can
get away with minimal damage.

Armor King
7/10
I like Armor King a lot because of his Dark Uppercut. You can also tag 
juggle with Kazuya. Try WGF, ~5, 1, 1, 1, Dark Uppercut. Armor King is 
the King (no pun intended) of CD mixup and has good pokes and powerful 
throws (plus a multi to boot). Weaknesses? Armor King's Dark Uppercut 
isn't as good as your WGF, and the tag juggles that you can do aren't 
really that damaging compared to Jin/ Heihachi. :( People elbow looks
cool though and when you are in trouble you can always... no no you 
should never rely on something as cheap as A. King's Cuffs.

Baek Do San
7/10
If you are a good Baek player who knows every single string, knows 
those crazy steps etc then up the stars by one. He has a Class 1 
launcher in his f,n,d,df+3 which is useful since Kazuya can tag in for 
a TGF + juggle. Moreover, Baeks df+2, 1,2,f+3 X3 into 3+4 has massive 
air time which is bound to irritate your opponent.

Bruce Irvine
8/10 (reduced from 10)
Okay, I may be really biased here, but Bruce is MY tag partner of 
choice for Kazuya Mishima. Nothing beats WGF~5, b+3, Cheese Knees and 
what more... you can do these after a CH Demon Gut Punch for Massive 
(and i mean MASSIVE) damage. Bruce is really deadly in his own right 
with good pokes, good range and again the cheese knee combo finisher. 
Sides, you won't need to worry about chickening much with bruce since 
most of his attacks are elbows and knees. Probably one of the more 
advantaged characters in this game. The only weakness of Bruce is that 
his moves can be easily sidestepped as most of them have bad tracking 
ability and also the lack of Class 1 launcher.

Bryan Fury
8/10
Bryan is not bruce.... bryan is not bruce. Say this to yourself 
repeatedly when choosing Bryan. Nothing beats Bryan's Chains of Misery 
throw which is definitely the most intimidating throw in the game. 
Imagine, pulling off 3 taunts in the middle of a juggle! Bryan is more 
than capable of doing big damage by himself with his CH stun juggles 
like WS+3(ch), WS+2,b+2, 1~4,3,3. When fighting against Bryan, a 
comeback is very likely. Moreover, Namco has blessed him with a Punch 
parry which I felt he sorely lacked in Tekken 3. Now he can more than 
hold his own against the big boys of the game. You can also tag juggle 
with Bryan using his WS+1, though Kazuya as I said before, isn't a 
juggle machine.

Eddy / Tiger
6/10
Eddy is dangerous IF you know how to use him. With that said, there are 
very few players who play Eddy effectively. Good players will be able 
to poke him out of the act since his moves have long startup or 
recovery time. If you are one of those who just mash with Eddy then the 
team would get no stars at all.

Ganryu
7/10
I must be joking right to give Ganryu this rating. Not really. Ganryu 
backs up Kazuya with just about everything he lacks. He has a class 1 
launcher so Kazuya can pull off those fancy TGF juggles. He has power 
to punish your opponent for wiffed attacks.... and he surprisingly CAN 
juggle. Moreover, his high stamina makes him more useful than one would 
think of him.

Gun Jack
3/10
I don't think Gun Jack is much good a partner for Kazuya since he is 
slow, makes a nice target for WGF, d+1+4 for Heihachi and doesn't have 
any powerful juggles. Has good stamina though so you can take a bit 
more beating. 

Heihachi Mishima
9/10
Heihachi is a combo monster. Tag out if out if Kazuya ever connects 
with his WGF (not on CH though) and let Heihachi finish the juggle. Try 
DGP (CH), WGF~5, 1, f+1,b+2,1 or 1, 1, 1, EWGF. Heihachi's EWGF is 
probably one of the most Abusable move in the game since if your 
opponent blocks it hit will suffer guard stun and if it connects, you 
can spell juggle mania. The only drawback of this team is Kazuya does 
not have a class 1 launcher and neither does Heihachi, making those 
super damaging combos like TGF, 1, f+1,b+2, 1 inaccesible. Another 
thing to remember is Heihachi's Hell sweep has been tonned down a lot, 
so use it only mostly in juggles. An excellent team overall.

Hwoarang
8/10
Good movement when you play Hwoarang is a must. Hwoarang can be really 
dangerous since his moves can do loads of damage in an instant. 
Moreover, he has a Class 1 launcher in his f,n,d,df+4 for Kazuya to do
some pretty mean juggles. Remember, good movement is a must for this
team to be succesful since Hwoarang's power moves are on the slow-ish
side.

Jin Kazama
10/10
I like this team mainly because Jin can do a lot of damage after a WGF.
A simple combo for beginners would be WGF~5, b,f+2,1,d+2, f,f+2. Does 
loads of damage and you can say bye bye to that red life bar. Although
both players have that all powerful gut punch move, they should both 
be played in a different manner. Jin's WS+2 has to be one of the best
WS move in the game. If you buffer tag for Jin's (E)WGF it will hit sM 
instead of high =) Nice going Namco. Jin's Hell Sweep is a good tool in
battle since you can juggle with a White Heron Combo after a single 
sweep. And the to add icing on the cake, Jin has a reversal to punish 
those who do not buffer chicken. Jin IMO is probably the best character 
in TTT.

Julia Chang
9.5/10
Julia is dangerous because of her 1~2,1 and 1~1,1 on CH. You see, her 
jab is only 8 frames, so you are going to get a lot of CH on those 
pitbull Mishimas who jab a lot. You can always tag out after a WGF and 
do THOSE elbows - bound to annoy your opponent. Her juggle ability has 
been beefed up a lot so you can do a df+2,1 after her elbow stun. Plus
she has been blessed with the Mountain crusher combo to make things a
misery for your opponent. Too bad she can't tag out after her Heaven
Cannon unblockable because that counts as a class 1 launcher (but she 
can juggle really good so who cares!) Overall an excellent partner who
gets a less than perfect score because she does not get any Netsu power
up. One last advice - ABUSE her Mad axes.

Jun Kazama
5/10
I will be nice to Jun and give her that extra half star since she is 
after all Kazuya's wife (btw, my ex-girlfriend sometimes dresses up 
exactly like Jun ;-) ) The only thing useful is sadly their tag throw.
Since Jun is rather slow, weak and is not a juggle machine, she does
not compliment her husband well. However, she does have a reversal 
which gives her an edge over people who do not buffer chicken.

King
6/10
King compliments Kazuya well in the department which he lacks most : 
Really damaging throws. Lets face it, Kazuya has only one useful throw 
(the stonehead) so King adds a little more variance to Kazuya's game. 
However, King does not have a good launcher nor is a good juggler. He 
however has some very good poking tools to set up his throws plus very 
good stamina. Moreover he has an unchickenable leg reversal which will 
surely come in handy at a higher level of play. 

Kuma/Panda
4/10
Okay, I gave Kuma/Panda a better rating than the Jacks because they 
have the f+1~1,1 G-Clef Cannon of the Changs which is just plain 
unfair. Even with his size, the first punch is only 8 frames! The speed 
of which it comes out plus the extra range makes this move great. Kuma 
also has all the other power moves of the Jacks which as said is 
powerful but rather slow. However, Kuma has been rather improved in TTT 
with the addition of the Hunting Bear stance. It is fun to play as Kuma 
once in a while considering not many players expect a good fight from a 
bear.

Kunimitsu
5/10
Although Kunimitsu is a formidable opponent, I don't think that she is 
the partner for Kazuya. With that said, Kuni is still dangerous with 
her numerous unblockables and great okizeme game. What she lacks in 
stamina, power and great juggle capability is made up by speed, stealth 
and unblockables. A good partner, but there are better.

Law
9/10
While Law has been toned down a bit since T3 when he was considered one 
of the best (if not THE best) character. Although Laws arsenal may be 
limited to  b+2,3,4 , b+1,2,1 and his various versions of flip kicks, 
he does have the ultimate parrying ability. Not only does he have high 
and low parries, he has a punch parry which will surely punish punch 
dependant characters like the Jacks. His juggles are both simple to do 
and hugely damaging making him a good partner for players who find it 
difficult to do Kazuya's more difficult juggles. 

Lee Chaolan
8/10
Ah... yes..... Kazuya and his step brother Lee. Lee can be dangerous 
himself when played correctly. His b+3~3 kick has insane priority and 
can come out fast. Moreover, he does have a class 1 launcher in the 
form of his d~db+4. Also, the first 4 (or was it 3) hits of his 
Infinite kicks is a very good counter against those pitbulls as if the 
first hit connects, the rest are guaranteed. Lee is a good juggler 
himself although most of his really damaging juggles are difficult to 
do. His Hitman stance will  sucker in people who know very little of 
him. Lastly choose Lee if not to see him and Kazuya in tuxedos (Very 
cool!) 

Lei Wulong
8/10
If you know Lei's Stances by heart and can perform his Haha Steps 
correctly, then Lei is a very useful partner for everyone. You don't 
need me to tell you how useful his Razor punches are right? Or how 
deceptive his sweeps can be from the Haha Step. My gripe bout Lei is 
his lack of ability to juggle but I feel that his deception and good 
strenght more than makes up for that. A formidable partner.

Ling Xiaoyu
7/10
Ling Xiaoyu is a pest. Her insane speed is a bane especially against 
slower characters. Therefore, Ling may be a very good partner for 
Kazuya when against slower characters. Her ability to duck into AOP 
(and duck even lower in AOP) makes her a good choice against high 
hitting dependant characters. However because of her stamina, or lack 
of it, a juggle or two may end the round as fast as it had started. Her 
lack of stamina, power and class 1 launcher results in her getting a 
less than perfect score but she makes up with for it with her great 
poking ability which complements Kazuya very well. I do feel that 
Kazuya's poking game isn't the best (I mean come on.... 10 frames jab). 
If you do choose Ling, it is vital to know every wah to get into each 
of her stances and out of it. Do not be too predictable (ie. use f,f+3 
racoon swing each and every time you want to get into backturn stance). 
Move move move and I'm sure you will drive your opponent up the walls.

Michelle Chang
8/10
Michelle should be played like Julia but for some differences. Her poor 
stamina means she cannot take as much damage as her daughter. Michelle 
somewhat compensates with some of her exclusive moves like df+3+4 and 
SS+3~4 which while good launchers, tend to miss a lot. Also, Mich 
damage in juggles is lower compared to Julia. With so much game time 
spent with the Changs lately, I find Mich to be the more powerful of 
the two Changs because she has better mobility. Her f,f+1 will NOT 
knock down on CH which means the sky scraper kick (4) follow up is 
guaranteed + you get a free okizeme. What more, it seems that her f,f+1
recovers faster (At least to me) and you can tag in loads of elbows 
after a juggle launcher. Her FC,df+2 elbow and d,df+2 is useful to get
stuns from which she can either go fo df+2,1 or hopkick juggle. A good
choice of a partner, but I'd rather stick with Mad Axes.

Mokujin/ Tetsujin
n/a
Hey , if you are that good, why not? Playing with Mokujin, your 
opponent will have to change his tactics every round..... or during the 
round itself (if Mokujin tags out for 15 secs or more he will immitate 
another character) which tends to lead to a lot of confusion. As I said 
before, if you are that good, then by all means use Mokujin. Good 
bragging rights ya know?

Nina Williams
7/10
I gave Anna a 8 so I think Nina deserves a 7. Nina has been tonned down 
WAY too much from Tekken 3. Her Divine Cannon takes 20 frames to come 
out now *arGh!*, but it still makes a good tag launcher. However, Nina 
is still dangerous with her various pokes, juggles and her bad habbit 
kick. She does have loads of multi-throws but getting that to connect 
on a good player is a different story. Although Nina's juggling ability 
has been somewhat crippled, she can still get the job done.

Ogre
6/10
Unlike Kazuya, most of Ogre's strategy is based on his DGP (or should 
it be Your DGP) After a DGP for Ogre though, his follow ups aren't as 
damaging as what you could do with Kazuya. He does have Lee's d~db+4 
kick though... though it doesn't act as a class 1 launcher. Not much to 
say here but if you do play Ogre/ Kazuya you will have to play all out 
offense since both aren't defensive minded characters.

Paul
8/10
If you are those who does 10 deathfist every round then reduce the 
rating to 0.5/10. Paul can be dangerous in the right, not-a-scrub, hands. 
He has excellent pokes and mixup which complements Kazuya well. 
Although he does not have the best juggling ability, the excellent 
power from his moves makes up for it. And when everything seems lost, 
remember you have his secret weapon -the deathfist. OOOOAAWAGGHH! Btw,
lately, I have been playing Paul with Kaz, and I must say that although
Paul's juggling capability isn't as good as what one might expect, it
is still excellent.

P.Jack
5/10
He does have a Class 1 Launcher so Kazuya can do those wonderful class 
1 Juggles. Other than that, do read my feelings on GunJack.

True Ogre
4/10
Reduce the score to 0/10 if you are those who does nothing but flame 
flame flame every round. True Ogre makes a big target for juggles, but 
he does have the ability to escape juggles which is always useful. 
Moreover, he has added range since his arms have grown so much bigger. 
However I'd rather use Ogre than T.Ogre since he is just one big fat 
lumbering oaf.

Wang Jinrei
6/10
I'm not joking. Wang is a good partner for Kazuya. He has an 
unchickenable left punch reversal - really useful for those poking 
Chang's, Mishimas etc. He has a Deathfist ... I don't think I need to 
explain that move do I? He has an excellent db+4 kick which is 
discreet, comes out fast, excellent for poking and interrupting and if 
on CH, 2 is guaranteed -> juggle -> massive life lost. Has the infamous 
1~2,1 and 1~1,1 of the Changs too. However, I do feel that his stamina 
leaves a lot to be desired and his frame rate is wayyyyyy bad resulting 
in a not so good score.

Yoshimitsu
9/10
Because of Yoshi's unpredictability, he rates highly in my books. He 
has great poking and okizeme game and a plethora of unblockables. Also 
he does have a class 1 Launcher which is rather useless (good luck in 
getting the Roo Kick to connect) His sword reversal is excellent 
against overly aggresive poking characters. Last but not least, he has 
the Suicide move which is useful to salvage some pride if you are 
losing badly (and maybe get a double K.O.)

*******************
Putting it Together
*******************

Even with all the knowledge that I know off, offered here, there is 
still one vital part of playing Kazuya which I cannot tell you and that 
is how to put every one of his technique together. If you wish to play 
him effectively, I suggest you give this FAQ a good read through, grasp 
the basic concepts of Kazuya, learn the useful techniques (WD, iWS+1,2) 
and from there build your own style. FYI, no 2 players in Tekken will 
play 100% alike (unless of course you talk about robotic Koreans who 
only know how to WD, EWGF_WS+1,2_Hell sweep) so develope your own 
personal style which you feel suites you best. 

After a great amount of playing, you will find that your skill has 
stagnated and that you can't improve anymore. Do not feel fustrated. 
This is the time when you consider changing your approach to your play. 
Think about using moves you'd never use in a certain situation before. 
Maybe try new setups to confuse your opponents. Just be creative. If 
not for creativity, none of the strategies here would have ever been 
discovered and people would still be relying on those oh-so-invincible 
10 hit combos.

Good luck and enjoy playing Tekken.

This is a site which I'm affliated with so I'm doing some shameless 
promotion of it. Please visit it... pretty please?

http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/
In my opinion this is the best site to get ALL the Tekken you could 
ever want, from those awesome juggle movies to fabulous Tekken art. 
Also helpful is the complete (well more than complete) juggle list for 
every character and frame data. Lets not forget this is the home to 
many great Tekken FAQs. However, I'm not sure if its my connection or 
what but the site takes a tad on the slow side to load (however the 
movie downloads are at a nice fast rate.)

The best part of this site is the extremely good coverage of WGF and 
EWGF. I admit that before reading this site, I had problems doing the 
EWGF consistenly... not anymore. This site also has combo list for some 
characters though it is still under construction. This site does have 
some Combo movies though the number is rather limited. The only 
complaint about this site is that it does not have enough Tekken Art 
and some of the screenshots on this page appear muddy.

This is Namco's official website. I don't usually visit this website 
though because what ever information that I can find here, I can find 
on TekkenZaibatsu.com.

Before learning of TekkenZaibatsu (tekken.net) I used to frequent this 
page for Tekken FAQs. Most of the FAQs found on TekkenZaibatsu is found 
here. There are some FAQs here which never made it to TekkenZaibatsu (I 
have no idea why) Gamefaqs.com is also a place to get FAQs for other 
games. They have some EXCELLENT faqs on Final Fantasy, Marvel Vs Capcom 
2, Baldur's Gate etc.

Another site which may be of interest to most people. This is where I 
downloaded all those Tekken Tag Tournament Competition movies. Any 
serious Tekken fan should download these movies to watch and learn. 
This site also contains most of the FAQs found on TekkenZaibatsu. Also 
worth checking out if you are an avid fan of other fighting games. I 
myself play Soul Calibur and Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 though I admit that I 
am no where as good in those games as I am in Tekken.

Well this is my homepage. It does not contain much on Tekken other than 
well this FAQ (and upcoming FAQs should I write any. However do check 
out my page if not to see how whacko me and my friends are. I have a 
modified (with permission) version of Andrew Lee's Baldurs Gate FAQ.

Well, a japanese site with loads of Mishima combo movies ranging 
including Kazuya movies. Worth the download since the movies are clear 
and crisp unlike some of the other movies on other japanese/ korean 
sites. Some mad juggles are here too!

Agent 3:16's site. Some of his combos are really breathtaking. I 
suggest you go there now and download his Unknown tribute, which, IMO
is much much better than the one on Zaibatsu. Other worthy movies are
Changs 3:16 and Xiaoyu 3:16. Do remember to download his Mishima 
Unleashed video too because he demonstrates some original (this is a 
hard word to come by nowadays) combos for Kazuya. Anyways Agent3:16 
has already retired *Sob*

This site is pretty good. I was most impressed by the Jun Tribute movie
on this site which ROCKed presentation wise. Unfortunately, the I must
say that most of the combos done on this site is disappointing since
they are usually average combos or ones that I have seen done to death.
Look for tribute movies here. However please be reminded that the all 
the combos are performed by Littlepony who is a girl after all. Loadsa
respect to girl gamers!

Download Dohee's Kazuya: The Special works! Man that rulz. Among the 
combos you see are some of the most INSANE stuff like df+2 (CH), WGF
juggle. By comparison, his Kazuya combos put other sites to shame.
Moreover, he has match video of Jang, the world tourney, throw movies
as well as other exhibitions. A must visit for all tekkenites. 
Fortunately Tekkenzone is BACK ONLINE. Dohee has since retired to join 
the army though.

Nothing much but loads and loads of movies from the LA tourney. The
quality is very good. Good Julia, Jin and Lei juggle movies but other
than that defunct of any Kazuya material (outside the La Tourney 
movies)

Mr. Kazuya Kazama's Site. This is a true hardcore Kazuya site with
loads of juggle movies for Kazuya. One to go to only if you are a 
Kazuya Fan.

Tragic's site, and more dedicated to 2D fighting games than Tekken. 
However you will find links to Raijin Aoki's mad combo movies and also 
the crazy 100MB Dohee Final movie.

Triple Lei's site. Has some weird stuff, but new movies are slow to 
come out. At least the movies he produces are original and of rather
good quality. Also has misc movies like Jinguu's Hwoarang movie and 
Nori's Jin movies.

This is an alternate jap site where you can download Dohee's final Jin
movie. Also if you missed out on old Dohee combo movies, this is your
best bet of where to find it. Not all of Dohee's movies are here though
so if you are missing weird ones like PJack or Wang, you are out of 
luck. Also you will find other movies from other sites.

This is BMW's site which I just felt like mentioning since it has some
worthy glitch movies including the Kazuya teleport glitch mentioned by
Pussykatz. However, the site has been down lately because of the heavy
downloading of TiT (tekken in texas) movies.

movie because it really is great.

This is a Taiwanese site for TTT and one of the best IMO. It contains

the most impressive of them all. Also downloadable are loads of match 
movies (though they aren't really impressive IMO)

********
Credits
********

I give credit where credit is due to the following :-

1) God
Without His will, I would never have written this FAQ. The Lord has 
permitted me not only to write this FAQ, but also given me the strength 
to face all the hard times in my life.

2) My ex-Girlfriend, Pang Kwai Lee (Momo)
She has tolerated me countless times and time again for playing Tekken 
even when we go out for a date. Also credit to her for being a nice 
huggable human teddy bear when I lose to some scrub due to some 
inexplicable reason. Well too bad our relationship had to end but at 
least what I have is the memories of all our happy times together.

3) Catlord
For his movelist, since Reverend_C based his movelist on yours in the 
first place..... I wonder how he finds ALL the moves in the game. Cat 
is also a kewl person to talk to on IRC.

4) Tekken Zaibatsu and Castel
For having excellent and up to date Tekken Info. Castel for his various 
Kazuya juggle movies which has made me play Kazuya even more.

5) bluu
Has added even more stuff bout Kazuya. Whoopee.... now the FAQ is 
Finally DONE. bluu has also helped a lot throughout the course of
making this FAQ with countless error corrections (hey writing a 
detailed FAQ isn't easy job you know) so big props to him for sitting
down and carefully reading it looking for those small mistakes I'd 
make.

6) pussykatz
Thanks for the extensive research and strategy on Kazuya's Teleport 
glitch trick. Without you, I (and other fellow kazuya players) might 
not even have known that such a thing existed.

7) 7ronko
7ronko, sorry mate. Did not know it was you who first mentioned DGP on 
CH can be escaped. So sorry bout that, hope this will make ammends. 
Also thanks for a lot of other info like the df+2, EWGF and other 
stuff.

8) Reverend_C, Exar_Kun, MCampbell (Devil_Jin), 
All have written solid guides of which every one of them are unique in 
their own ways. I have used RevC's movelist format since I'm rather 
impressed with his work. I feel that Rev is one of the better FAQ 
authours of the current stream of Tekken players, so Rev, I'm looking 
forward to your Julia FAQ. Hey DJ, your FAQ certainly has come a long 
loooooooooong way since v1.0 which I'm sure you and me agree was a 
travesty. Hope to read more from you soon especially on Baek. 

9) Kazuya Kazama
For helping me confirm that df+2(CH) can be followed up with a WGF 
juggle when half the rest of the TZ people thought I was smoking too 
much crack.

10) Han Tzen
My sparring partner who gives me a good trashing in Tekken 3 on the 
Playstation but ultimately gets a good trashing in Tekken Tag in the 
Arcades. Too bad he spends too much time with is girlfriend now (though
I can't really say thats bad)

11) Han Shin
He is my Sinsei in Tekken, helping me improve my game a lot. Before 
playing him, my game was very linear, but he has thought me a lot 
since, especially with his irritating poking Changs.... Just love to 
hate them. 50-3 trashings.... Nightmares.

12) Tekken Forum and IRC
The folks over at Tekken Zaibatsu Forum. Really fun talking with you 
guys.... and turgeon for all those good laughs! Props especially to my
huggable friend, Night especially on IRC :) And a big thanks to the
people at Tekken Central forum too.

" There is something new to learn in Tekken everyday, and if you 
              haven't learnt that by now, you ain't learnt nothing yet."
