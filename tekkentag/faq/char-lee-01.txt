*Biography of Lee Chaloan*

   Lee Chaolan was an orphan boy growing up in China. On one fateful day, he 
was adopted by a rich businessman. This businessman was named Heihachi 
Mishima, CEO of the Mishima Financial Empire and the founder of "The King of 
Iron Fist Tournament." He was raised by Heihachi as if he was Heihachi's own 
son. But Lee had a brother who took much of Heihachi's attention away from 
him. That brother was Heihachi's biological son, Kazuya Mishima. The two 
grew up like any pair of brothers should. Unfortunately, Lee was unable to 
learn the Mishima style of karate, while Kazuya became a master of it. When 
Heihachi found out about Lee's apparent inability to learn the Mishima style 
of karate, Heihachi enlisted an old friend family friend named of Wang 
Jinrei. While Heihachi took of the task of training Kazuya, Wang went to 
work with Lee. At first, Lee was unable to master the simpilist of 
techniques. Then, Wang brought Lee to an old friend's dojo in America so 
that Lee could train with the man's son. That young son was known by many 
fighters now as Marshall Law. While Wang talked with his old friend over 
glasses of rice wine and tea, Lee and Law sparred with each other, with both 
learning much during the stay. While in the U.S., Lee learned that Kazuya 
had arrived in the city they were residing in. Lee eventually found him, who 
was fighting an American named Paul Phoenix. Their bout ended in a draw with 
both having a variety of injuries. As they fought, Lee watched Paul and 
learned his powerful shredder kick combo.

   One fateful day, Lee received a letter from Heihachi, saying that Lee 
must return immeditately to the Mashima Family Mansion. Lee left the dojo 
and returned to the masion, where Heihachi gretted Lee with open arms. It 
was nearly five years since Lee had set foot in the immense mansion and the 
mansion had not changed a single bit after he left. Heihachi took Lee to the 
Mishima family dojo, which was a place that was completely forbidden from 
him as a child. He felt honored as he passed through the threshold. Lee was 
stunned to find that Kazuya was there, meditating in complete silence, with 
a huge scar that had been there as long as Lee had remembered. In the dojo, 
Heihachi  forced Lee to fight with Kazuya in one-on-one combat with no 
rules. Lee tried his best, but eventually Kazuya beat him to a bloody pulp. 
From that day forward, Lee swore that he would do all he can to become a 
true warrior, capable of defeating BOTH his adopted brother, who defeated 
him, and his adopted father, who shunned him.

   At the first Iron Fist Tournament, Lee finally got a chance to fight 
Kazuya near the end of the tournament. However, he was defeated, allowing 
Kazuya to advance to the final rounds against Heihachi. In that battle, 
Kazuya won and threw the lifeless body of Heihachi over the cliff where 
Kazuya was thrown off so long ago. During the years before Heihachi's 
readmergence, Lee served as Kazuya's personal assistant and was ground under 
Kazuya's heel. This also gave him even more motivation to despise and hate 
Kazuya. Eventually Kazuya announced the second Iron Fist Tournament, where 
Lee saw Heihachi for the first time in over five years. Unfortunately, he 
saw Heihachi's punches and kicks much more frequently than Heihachi's face. 
At the end, Heihachi regained control of the Mishima Financial Empire that 
was taken away from him during his absence. He also threw Kazuya into a 
volcano to make sure that he and his evil power was to never return to this 
plane of existence. With Heihachi back in charge, he gave Lee the assginment 
of running the Tekken Force, the MFE's personal army. During one of their 
earliest missions, Lee was absorbed by Ogre until being released with the 
help of Heihachi and a boy named Jin Kazama, Heihachi's illegitimate 
grandson during the third Iron Fist Tournament.

   Now the Tekken Tag Tournament has begun. Who will emerge victorious?

*Advantatges and Disadvantages of Lee*

Advantages-

   Being new to TTT, people don't know much about Lee. Most people find that 
Lee looks and fights just about the same as Law. This assumption is what 
makes Lee useful. He has his own unique blend of moves from Kazuya, Paul, 
and Law, who are three of the most deadliest characters that have appeared 
in the Tekken series. Lee aquired Kazuya's Axe Kick, Paul's Shredder, and 
many moves from Law. He now has a HUGE, if not IMMENSE, set of new moves 
unique to only him. One of the greatest additions to his movelist is the 
Hitman Stance. It has four different moves that can be performed while in 
that stance. It also allows Lee to sidestep while remaining in the Hitman. 
Many moves in his arsenal can end in Hitman, creating confusion for your 
opponent. Having a body type much like Law, Lee can move around very quickly 
without much of a problem. This gives Lee a major advantage against people 
who can't move around very quickly, such as the Jacks, Kuma, and Ganryu.

Disadvantage-

   In gaining a great amount of speed, he has extremely poor stamina. His 
lack of stamina is a major problem since his other problem is a lack of 
power moves and one hit wonders. Those two disadvantages alone makes 
fighting quick powerhouses very difficult if not immposible. Another problem 
that Lee has is difficulty in  juggling opponents effectively. Lee can be a 
very powerful juggler at times, but the difficulty for his most powerful 
juggels is staggering. Although Lee has a variety of moves, he lacks useful 
moves in two very key departments. Those departments are side step attacks 
and mid-level attacks. His side step attacks are useful, but requires much 
thought to be put into and his lack of mid-height hits give him a 
disadvantage against people who block low. They can simply duck a combo or 
chain and you'll be eating a juggle in no time.

*Movelist and Conventions*
With the development of the "Move Analysis" portion of my FAQ, I beleved 
that a movelist and convention list would be a waste of space for this FAQ. 
Then, I saw my FAQ printed out without much info on it. So I have decided to 
keep my movelist on, with a few new features. I have also added plenty of 
new things that I might have missed in the movelist and the convetions. I 
also omitted things that I found useless for Lee (crouch dash!!). These 
conventions and the movelist come from tekkenzaibatsu.com's list.

*Move Analysis*
This section used to be known as the "Moves to Use and Abuse," which covered 
basic moves that every decent Lee player should know. It had also note any 
moves that were, in my opinion, invaluable in ANY fight. But I have recently 
gotten e-mail saying that I didn't include this move or that trick. Well, 
FINE! I'm gonna analyze every stinkin move in his movelist. Everybody 
satisfied?

--Throws--

Neck Fracture - 1+3  {1}
   This is a basic, generic front throw that everyone has. Lee simply grabs 
their head, twists his body a bit, and falls to the floor, breaking the neck 
of the opponent. A bit on the weak side for a throw. Still, it is a generic 
front throw, so you can't expect much. It also gives a person a free sweep 
if the throw connects

Chaastiment Punch - 2+4  {2}
   The other basic, generic front throw. Lee puts his opponent into a 
headlock position and then gives them a powerful shot to the head. This is 
quite possibly one of the slowest throws in the game. With that said, I use 
this throw often so that  I can waste precious seconds from my opponent if 
they happen to have very little health. Most times, this ends any hope for a 
comeback.

Knee Bash - f,f+3+4  {1+2}
   One of the quickest throws in the game. Lee grabs his opponent and 
suddenly knees his opponent in the face. It does a little bit more damage 
than his generic front throws. But the real power of this move is the 
ability to add this into a rushing game. I have been able to trick people by 
goating them with a knee bash and then following it up with shredder, 
spinning slide, axe kick, or another knee bash.

Harassment - (LEFT) 1+3_2+4_2+5  {1}
   A side throw from the left side. Lee forces his opponent to the ground, 
locks their arm behind their back, and steps on their head. The funny thing 
about this throw is that he is laughing the whole entire time. Get this off 
for some major style points

Stunner - (RIGHT) 1+3,_2+4_2+5  {2}
   A side throw from the right side. Lee steps around the opponent, puts 
them in a head lock, then performs a flip and lands smack dab on their head. 
Resembles a type of tumbling throw. The way he gets behind them is 
reminiscent of how Dhalsim in SF EX + Alpha does one of his throws that sort 
of snake around his opponent.

Bulldog (BACK) 1+3_2+4_2+5
   A back throw. Lee simply performs a bulldog, slamming his opponent's face 
into the ground. Really looks good. One problem: the chances of a person 
being able to get behind a person and perform the throw is slim to nil.

--Moves/Arts--

Hopkick_Uppercut - u/f+4_d/f+2
   These two moves are not mentioned in the movelist, but they are the most 
commonly use popups that Lee has in his arsenal. They are easy to perform 
and are extremely useful in counterattacking an opponent. Good to use if you 
have been going low against an opponent and you decide that you want to go 
for their midsection since Lee lacks any good midsection hits.

1-2 Punches - 1,2
   A set of punches borrowed from Law. It's simply one left and one right 
punch throw one after another. The reason that this combo is so useful is 
that it gives Lee a extremely quick counter attack after someone has done a 
long string. It also gives Lee the power to actually deter someone from 
trying a move since this set of punches have priority. It can also link into 
the rave punches or the rave war combo.

Rave Punches - 2,2
   EXTREMELY slow right punches. SInce both hit high, there is a major 
chance for retaliation off of this move. DO NOT USE THESE PUNCHES.

Rave War Combo - f+2,2,2
   Quite possibly the best punch combo that Lee has next to the backfist 
rush or the adv. backfist rush. It hits high, mid, then high, making it 
useful against people who try to duck under punch combos. Doing only the 
first two hits gives you a slight advantage, although you might be hit out 
of it. It is really a good combo filler and at times catches people off 
guard. It's a good move to use when you want to try to get close to you 
opponent without much fear.

5_6_7 Punch Combo - 1,1,1,1,1_2,2_f+2,2,2
   Affectionately known as the "Machine Gun Punches." Lee simply does four 
quick jabs, then can opt for a fifth left jab, lead into the rave punches, 
or the rave war combo. It's really up to the player. The best one IMO are 
the punches that lead into the rave war combo. You can also perform other 
such combos with a fewer number of 1's, such as 1,1,f+2,2,2.

Backfist Rush or Adv. Backfist Rush - b+1,1, [3+4_2]_ b+1,N,1,2
   This is an extremely useful move if your outside of sweep range. Lee just 
comes in from out of nowhere and hits you with two left jabs to your face. 
Then, Lee has various options. He could go into hitman and confuse your 
opponent. He could complete the string follow up the jabs with a quick 
backhand, forcing your opponent out of sweep range. One of the more ruthless 
options that Lee has with the backfist rush is to buffer a throw with the 
rush. Do recall how close you get to an opponent when you perform a backfist 
rush. You can get extremely close to your opponent giving you a chance to 
stuff a move down their throat. Personally, I use this move as a filler in a 
combo or as a quick way to get near an opponent and harass him/her some 
more, especially with a throw. Hehe!

Silver Sting_Quick Silver Sting - f+3+4_u/f+3
   These two moves provide what might be the only power moves that Lee has. 
Both simply cause Lee to jump into the air and kick his opponent. The 
difference between them is speed, power, and range. The regular silver sting 
is quite stong and can also induce a guard break. It also has great range 
for a jump kick.  The quick silver sting is not as stroing and does not 
cause a guard break. The quick silver sting, however has much better 
recovery time than the regular silver sting. That extra speed gives it the 
power to be used in a chip and combos. Uses of both are vital to playing 
opponents since they both look quite the same and that only the player 
notices the difference. These, unfortunately all hit high, making them esy 
to duck underneath.

Slice Kick - d/b+4
   I really don't use this move often in my game, although I really should. 
Equivalent to Kaz's own d/b+4, it is capable to hit grounded opponents. I 
have also heard that it does stun on counter hit. The stun that it provides 
is similar to King's d+3+4,4,4 on counter hit. The problem with it is the 
fact that there is nothing that can be done after the stun, including 
throws, jabs, etc. I have yet to confirm the possibilty to tag in your 
partner for a hit.

Step-in-Kick - d/f+3
   Please check my comments on the rave punches for my opinion on this move.

Axe Kick - f,f+3
   A good move to pull on an unsuspecting opponent. Lee performs a classic 
axe kick in the style of the Mishima family. It's tough to get down 
correctly, it can be used in an effective mixup game with his f,f,N moves. 
Like the other axe kicks, this one causes a fall back crumple stun where the 
opponent falls quickly to the ground. You could possibly go into the shin 
kicks, especially if its a big character.

Shaolin Spin Kicks - 4,3,4
   Not particularly useful in a tough fight. It is still pretty quick and 
can be used in a juggle or two. The first two hits are good to chip at 
opponents with. Good move to use to get people to fall for the roundhouse to 
flip.

Roundhouse to Flip - 4,u+3
   This is an extremly useful juggle starter. It starts with Lee performing 
a regular 4 followed by a sudden flip, causing your opponent to fly into the 
air. Very useful if you use it with the machine gun kicks or the shaolin 
spin kicks to cause confsuion. I've seen it used in parts of combos and it 
can do some serious damage.

Silver Sting_Quick Silver Sting - f+3+4_u/f+3
   These two moves cause Lee to jump into the air and perform a jumpkick 
right into the head of his opponents. Each are simply variations on the same 
move. The silver sting causes a guard stun and forces your oppoenent quite a 
ways back. But it has a horrible recovery time. The quick silver sting is 
much quicker (duh!) and has a better recovery time, but it lacks power and 
the guard stun effect.

Quick Somersault - FC,u/b_u_u/f+4 [~5]
High Somesault - FC,U/B_U_U/F+4
Rainbow Kick - FC,U/B_U_U/F+3+4
   I really don't like any of these flips. Why, you might ask. Simple. They 
all require a full crouch position. That alone eliminates their usefulness. 
The quick somersault is a good juggle starter and is taggable, but it 
required the all so tell tale FC position. The high somersault is just to 
get behind a person. The rainbow kick is really useful since you can get 
people on the floor. (Please check 'Okizeme Freak' section)

Shin Kick Combo - d+4,4,4,4~3
   This is the move that every Lee player will use as a last resort. The 
first three hits are low, so you have no fear of being countered. The last 
hit is mid, so if they duck to block all the low hits, the last one will 
always get them. Since these kicks are all use 4 to hit, it's quite easy to 
buffer a chicken against counterers. Some words of caution:

1. The last kick has an insanely long delay time, thus allowing you opponent 
to get in an attack. This means trouble against power hitters, such as Paul, 
Heihachi, and Jin. Fortunately, you can go into the hitman stance with a ~3 
after the last 4, which cancels the delay time completely. Another bonus 
about going into hitman is that it auto blocks high and mid attacks, so you 
don't have to worry about getting hit with a deathfist or a twin piston.

2. The beginning low kicks are EXTREMELY easy to parry for a veteran. Since 
not many people have parried the shin kicks on me, I don't know exactly what 
can happen off a parried shin kick, but I can only imagine...

Use this on people who just tagged in since they can't automatically block 
low as they come in. The shin kick combo also should be used to chip since a 
sucessful 1st hit guarantees a sucessful 2nd hit.

This move also has a habit of killing scrubs and newbies. Don't ask me why.

Shin Kick Mix-Ups - d+4,N,4,3,4_d+4,N,4,4,4_d+4,N,4,u+3_d+4,N,4~3
   These mix-ups for the shin kick combo are quite useful. The first two are 
excellent juggle enders, although you may not be able to get in all the hits 
for the second variation. The third variation is extremely useful. Once 
opponents get acustomed to the shin kick combos, throw this into the mix and 
watch their expression of horror just gush out to their face. The last 
variation is the most useless, since it links up into the silver cyclone, 
which is an unblockable that has a huge amount of lag time. Thus, it allows 
someone to get a jab or a ewgf in your face.

Thses mixups are designed to confuse intermediate and even some experts. 
They do work, especially if you've "trained" your opponent to anticipate a 
shin kick combo and suddenly switching it with a d+4,N,4,u+3, poping up the 
opponent giving you a chance to try out a juggle or two.

Low Kick to Head Kicks to Step-In Kick_Feint Hammer - d+3,3,f+3_b+3
   Another good combo to that forces your opponent back. You could add more 
3's into it, but it increases your chances of being countered. Then again, 
you use all 3's so they are easy to buffer a chicken with. I use this move 
in ending my combos that cause my opponent to hit the floor hard. This is 
another good move to hit people that are tagging in.

Blazing Kick - d,d/b+4 [~5]
   This is Lee's best juggle starter. Heck, I consider it as Lee's ONLY 
juggle starter. Getting the blazing kick in consistently is vital for you 
success as a Lee player. It knocks them pretty high in the air, thus 
allowing you to use your imagination to develop some hard hitting combos. Or 
you could just tag in your partner and allow them to kick a**. One word of 
caution: doing the blazing kick can at times be extremely difficult (One 
day, I couldn't even do the motion for about a week so you can imagine my 
anger and amount of profanity). So practice it consatantly until you can get 
it to work in your sleep.

Spinning Slide - f,f,N+3+4
   The spinning slide is an excellent surprise move where Lee dahses at his 
opponent and then slides leg first at his opponent, causing both to fall to 
the floor This move should only be used on people as they tag in, since it 
hits low. It's possible to add it into your chipping game, since forcing 
your opponent back to allow enough room for the dash and neutral. I haven't 
try to do it, though

Silver Tail - d_FC,D/F+4,4,4...   Silver Demon Fist - 2,2,1
   This is an extremely useful move to add in on occassion. It's similar to 
Law's dragon tail, but much faster. On counter hits, it causes the opponent 
to expose their side, thus allowing for a quick side throw or shin kick 
combo. But with the new sweep blocking system, it can leave you open and 
vulnerable to attack. So, it's best to use it as infrequently as possible. 
You can also perform an infinite number of low sweeps by holding d/f and 
pressing 4 over and over. I only use that if they try to roll at me to get 
into a more offensive stance.

If you have Kazuya as your partner, you can perform the silver demon fist, 
an unblockable similar to Kazuya's rolling gut punch, f+1+2. It's extremely 
fast and Lee sort of dashes in, increasing it's range. It causes a crumple 
stun similar to getting hit a with Kaz's rolling gut punch. What makes it 
useful is that it looks exactly like a regular silver tail until the last 
second. Thus it has a much better surprise factor than his other 
unblockables.

Silver Whip - f+4
   This has got to be the fastest kick in the entire game! Not even some of 
Hwoarang's fastest kick combos can match it's speed. The kick is easy to 
perform. It snaps a person's head back once they are hit by it, making it an 
essential against people who are relentless bulldogs and chippers. It also 
has quite an amount of priority for just a one hit move. By repeating this 
move, you can force your opponent to rush back at you, allowing you to stay 
on a constant offense. Try to stick in a jab here and there after a few 
silver whips and see what happens.

Machine Gun Kicks - 4,4,4
   Whoa! Talk about speed! Lee busts out three kicks in rapid sucession at 
an opponents face. Since they all hit high and use the same button, it is a 
simple matter to buffer a chicken against counters. They have a great 
ability at stoping bulldogs much like the silver whip. They also have an 
equal, if not greater priority than the Silver Whip.  The machine gun kicks 
can also be used as an effective combo filler.

Infinity Kicks - WS+3,3,[d+3_d/f+3],3,3,3,3,3.....
   Ah, Lee's signature combo. Everyone knows about it, but people just never 
expect it coming. Quite useful against overly offensive people, since it 
immidiately puts people on the defensive. Do not use it if your far away 
form your opponent. The Infinty Kicks were designed to put pressure on your 
opponent at close range. If your too far, your going to get an ewgf or a 
pheonix smasher in your face.

Mist Wolf Combo - b+3>3
   Not all that useful. All Lee does is a little snap kick toward the 
stomach and then a kick to the face. It's a good move for people at close 
range. But the most important aspect of this move is that it can lead into 
the the mist trap.

Mist Trap - b+3~3~4
   I've heard A LOT about the usefulness of this move. You know what? Their 
right. This is the perfect move to use if a opponent is defending. I believe 
that this is the first move in Tekken history that requires a block to 
actually get to work right. Basically, Lee kicks them at the head, causing 
your opponent to grab the kick. Then, Lee performs a sweet animation where 
he simply pummels them with a vicious throw much like Kaz's Bitch Kicks 
throw.

Silver Heel - b+4~3_5
   Not much of a move but extremely useful to add into a nice mix. It 
doesn't do much except juggle on CH. Even with that, it's reminiscent with 
Bryan's b+1, so it is difficult to juggle with. It's usefulness increases 
when you realize that you can tag out without having to buffer a 5. Imagine 
this: I constantly harass someone with b+4 until they begin to block. I 
perform the silver heel from quite a distance, which leads that someone to 
dash in. Suddenly, I tag out and my partner comes in with a cross body chop. 
Sad ain't I? By pressing 3 rather than tagging out Lee ends in the Hitman 
stance, which is useful upclose since Lee takes a small step back during the 
animation to the hitman stance.

Cutter - b,b+4~3
   Not much of an awesome move here. All it does is a simple roundhouse that 
sends your opponent flying if it hits. If it doesn't you can always go into 
the hitman right after the move and watch them try to attatck you while you 
have them eat some moves off of the hitman. I've seen it used in some 
juggles which did some damage.

Shredder - f,f,N+3~4_WR+3+4,4
   The shredder kick combo is one of the most important moves in Lee's 
arsenal. Borrowed from Paul, it allows Lee a chance to stay aggressive. It 
works especially well as an okizeme move, a juggle starter, and a juggle 
ender. You can mix up the end of the shredder with a 4 for a high kick, a 
d/f+4 for a mid kick, and a d+4 for a low kick. This is an excellent move to 
use in order to close the distance on an opponent that is trying to run away 
from Lee.

Hitman Stance - 3+4
   The hitman stance is a vital part of Lee's overall figthing style. Many 
of his moves go into this stance after a set of moves. The hitamn stance 
also gives you various options. You could use a couple of 1's to do a bit of 
chipping. Or a nice 2 to pop'em into the air for some juggling. Or try a 3 
for a bit of a power move that also limks up into a combo that looks much 
like the mist trap by pressing . Or try a quick 4 sweep that causes your 
opponent to float for a small juggle. Or if you wanna try to be sneaky, 
press u or d to sidestep toward your enemy. As I stated in the shin kick 
combo portion of the FAQ, the hitmam automatically blocks high and mid 
attacks, thus allowing you to do a slow string and not get a face full of 
fist.

Silver Cyclone - d+3+4
   The fastest out of Lee's two regular unblockables. Lee ducks down 
slightly so that he can duck under jabs. I'm not really sure that he can 
duck under mid height hits. It can be seen a mile a way, though, with all 
those pretty silver lightning bolts that surround him.

Silver Fang - d/b+1+2    Cancel - u,u
   This unblockable looks exaclty like Law's unblockable. What am I saying? 
It IS Law's unblockable. It can be cancelled so you wont be left to get your 
a** kicked while you charging for the silver fang. It also has a surprsising 
amount of range for an unblockable.

--Sidestep--

SS+2 - Rear Cross Punch
   Lee performs a sidestap and punches his opponent in the face. The move 
doesn't do much damage, but it does cause a guard stun if an opponent should 
block it, which is nearly consistently. It also does cause a stun when it 
hits with a clean hit.

SSR+3_SSL+4 - Lee Screw
   Lee performs a sidestep and then pulls out a vicious slash kick that 
looks quite similar to Bruce and Bryan's f,f+3. It's a pretty strong move, 
which is always a bonus. There is one problem: the move depends on what 
sidestep you are using. If you sidestep toward Lee's right side, use 3. If 
you sidestep to Lee's left, use 4. This is difficult to get down, especially 
in a close match.

--Ten Hit Combo--

d/f+1:22:13:3:3:4:3:4

   Like most of the characters that came from Tekken 2, Lee has only one ten 
hit combo. The ten hit was borrowed from one of Law's ten hits. It's 
relatively easy to block it and can give your opponent time to retaliate if 
they block it all. I personally DO NOT like ten hit combos, due to the fact 
that they are easy to block.

--Special Movement--

Backflip~Hitman - b,b,N+3+4~3
   Lee simply performs a backflip similar to Nina's, Anna's or Bruce's. The 
whole point of using the backflip is to simply run away from an opponent to 
get some breathing room. This allows for the setup of Lee's very useful 
running game, which allows him to do the shredder mixups as well as his 
spinning slide. Use it in conjunction with the hitman stance so that you can 
remain on some sort of offensive stance while retreating with the backflip.

Mist Step - f,N
   Most of you are going "huh?" Well, Lee performs what looks like a 
combination of a crouch dash (f,N,d,d/f) and a wave step (d,d/f,f). It 
allows Lee to cover a whole lot of space in a very short amount of time. It 
can also be cancelled out with almost any move. It can be used to buffer in 
a quick throw or an even quicker f+4. If you hold b while performing a mist 
step, you will be able to block oncoming high/mid hits.

Fake Somersault - FC, u/b_u_u/f
   Now this is a move that even brings a "huh?" to even me. All Lee does is 
a fake flip. No attack power. No real distance move. Not even a second move 
that you can go into like Law's fake somersault. I think that this move was 
added as some kind of taunt for Lee.

*Combos*
This section of my FAQ will cover combos (well duh!). If you have any combos 
that you wish to be mentioned in this FAQ, please email me at 
raizel27@hotmail.com. Please include the timing for hits and make special 
notes such as "extremely powerful."

Afer many hours of thinking and practice about/with Lee. I have come to a 
critical conclusion: Lee sucks as a juggler. He has a nice multitude of 
juggle starters such as the Blazing Kick or the Hitman~2. Unfortuately, he 
lacks the ability to keep his opponent in the air for a long time. I find 
that it's best just to tag in your partner for some combos. But by popualr 
demand (and the Raijin Juggle movie), I will finally include some combos in 
this FAQ.

---Launchers---

d/f+2 - generic uppercut
u/f+4 - generic hopkick
Hitman,4 - hitman stance, sweep
Hitman,2 - hitman stance, uppercut
b+4 CH - silver heel
d,d/b+4 - blazing kick
f,f,N+3 - starter for the shreedder

---Suggested Combo Fillers---

Combo fillers are basically moves that a person can use to juggle opponents, 
whether it's only a puny three hit juggle or a monstrous seven hit juggle. 
Since I don't really like to juggle with Lee, here's a small list of moves 
that can be used in a combo.

<standing jabs> - these are often the best juggle fillers, since they are 
the easiest to perform and keep them in the air for quite some time.

<backfist rush> - never, EVER complete the entire string unless you want to 
end the juggle with the combo. The first two hits act much like the standing 
jabs, although they get Lee closer to opponents.

<hitman, 2> - only do this as a first hit off of the blazing kick.

<shin kick combo_shin kick variations> - these are great ways to end a 
combo. Leaves the feeling of "I can't believe that happened to me" on 
opponents. The shin kick combo works especially well against big opponents 
like Jack and Kuma. Plus, it does a nice amount of damage.

<silver whip> - great move to use as the first or last hit off a juggle. 
Using it as a last hit really creates that sense of fear that my Lee is able 
to use that super quick kick in a combo, which inversely means that I must 
know that move can be used to stop people cold.

<machine gun kicks> - not such a great juggling move. It's best used if you 
want to do some damage off a combo with relative ease and without wasting a 
lot of time.

<low kick, head kick, feint hammer_step in kick> - this is an extremely good 
move to use during a juggle. Although it may not do a lot of damage, it 
looks really good to do it right.

<infinity kicks> - these are the most underrated juggling moves in the book. 
It's best done off of a blazing kick.

<silver sting_quick silver sting> - one hell of a way to end a juggle. Using 
these moves in a combo that causes major damage, which is useful for a 
person who has some of the weakest juggles in the game.

<shredder> - another big damaging way to end a juggle. Problem is the fact 
that getting a shredder out during the small amount of time that you have in 
a juggle is hard at best.

*Fighting Strategies as Lee*

Strategies for any charcter are simply a joke IMO. It has always been my 
belief that you can use a character in a variety of ways. An excellent 
example would be two of my good friends. They use the same characters but in 
very distinct ways. Both use Paul, but one chips, uses good juggles, and 
constanly bulldogs his opponents while the other uses Phoenix Smasher, a 
crazy okizeme game, and has a tendency to turtle a lot. Therefore, I'll try 
to give an all around strategy on how to use Lee in various manners.  If you 
feel that I have missed something important, e-mail me at 
raizel27@hotmail.com.

---General Lee (not the confederate general)---

Whether you use Lee to bulldog, turtle, or whatever, there are a few things 
that you have to keep in mind with Lee. Lee's insane amount of speed allows 
for either a great dashing offense, where assaults with pokes and jabs rain 
down on opponents, an excellent defensive retreat, forcing opponents to drop 
their guard as they try to hit you. But be careful playing a defensive game. 
Lee has extremely poor stamina. If you get hit while in a turtle game, your 
gonna be in for a world of hurt.

Another point that I should make when using Lee with any type of mentality 
is to keep the confusion factor extremely high. Use nearly every move in the 
movelist. Never do the same custom string more than twice in a round. Try to 
use moves that have multiple switch ups., such as the laser edge kick 
variations. Those are extremely useful.

---Lee as a Pitbull---

Fighting Lee as a pitbull causes people to get aggrevated very quickly. 
Don't know why. So he has some of the quickest moves in the game. So he has 
an infintiy combo that drives people nuts sometimes. So his hitman has an 
unusual amount of priority over moves. It's not a big deal. But to a 
bulldog, these are all pluses for using Lee. Due to Lee's great speed, he 
can hit his opponents with a flurry of hits, forcing them outside of their 
normal attack range. Then while they dash back in, Lee hits them with a 
barrage of blows that can do some heavy damage.

Here are a few strings that I find very useful against opponents:

b+1,1, d+4,4,4, 1,2, u/f+3_f+3+4
1,f+2>2, d+1, ws+3,3d+3, u/f+3_f+3+4
f+4, f+4, b+1,1, f+4, f+4, b+1,1...
f+4, d+4,4,4, f+4, d+4,4,4...
1,f+2>2, D+1, d/f+4 (should lead to a silver sting), 2,2,1_u/f+3_f+3+4
f+4, f+4, d+4,4,4, f+4, f+4, d+4,N,4, u+3...
f+4, b+1,1, d+3,3,f+3, f,f,N,3+4_u/f+3_f+3+4

One move that I have found uses for Lee in this aspect of his game is the 
mist step. It's appearance is similar to the wave step (d,d/f,f) and helps 
Lee move across the screen at a high rate of speed. It can be canceled out 
with a b if your about to be hit with a power move such as the Pheonix 
Smasher. The mist step can also be cancelled out with a ss or a move. One 
move that I find extremely useful to use during the mist step is the silver 
whip. It comes out extremely fast and can annoy the best of opponents. You 
can switch that up with a d+4,4,4,4 or d+4,N,4,u+3 to get extremely 
annoying. Add in the f,f+3+4 throw off of the mist step to be more annoying.

His advanced backfist rush is invaluable in a pitbull game. You can do 
various moves off of that move. It also opens the opponent for a brief 
period of time, giving you the chance for the upper hand. You can also use a 
partial backfist rush and get in close with a throw.

But if all else fails, try the mist trap. Although it's insanely difficult 
to use (anyone that can get this out consistently, please e-mail me on how 
to do it right) it will turn a turtle into a whimpering sack. Remember, the 
mist trap works only on opponents that are blocking.

---Lee as a Turtle---

Fighting on the defense is difficult at best with Lee. At worst, it can be a 
complete nightmare for a Lee player. Being on the defensive causes a person 
to rely heavily on powerful moves, which creates a very powerful comeback 
game. Unfortunately, Lee, lacks power moves which basically eliminates his 
comeback potential.

Lee fortunately has some very useful moves on the defensive. His backflip 
helps him to get quite a distance away from his opponent in a quick way. 
This gives him time to set up his excellent f,f game. His Silver Heel is a 
great defensive move and can give you the chance to tag in your partner 
without the fear of retaliation.
Surprisingly, Lee's abiltiy to change into the hitman stance off of his 
moves allows him to get extremely defensive. Most players try to jab him 
with a 1 in hopes of getting a quick hit. Fortunately, it automatically 
blocks all mid hits and ducks under most regular high hits. This factor 
allows Lee the ability to damage opponents well without much fear of 
retaliation.

The mist step, which I mentioned in the pitbull section, can also be used by 
a turtle. In a turtle's mindset, they have to wait for their opponent to 
make some type of fatal error so that they can retaliate with a 
counterattack. The mist step is the perfect thing to use to bait your 
opponent into attacking. Since you can cancel the motion by holding b, you 
are safe from most forms of retaliation. But if you want to cause damage, 
mix that up with a silver heel. Most people will try to charge in and hit 
you during the mist step. But when the silver heel hits, it will usually 
cause a CH, which will pop them up, thus allowing for a combo.

Although limited, Lee's sidestep moves can be of some use on a defensive 
game. Although his ss+3_ss+4 come out much too slow, his ss+2 gives him the 
ability to strike very quickly while trying to run away. What is so good 
about the ss+2 is the fact that it causes a guard break when they do block 
it, giving you a bit of a better recovery advantage.

---Lee as an Okizeme Freak---

If you don't know, okizeme is a japanese term that basically means hitting 
an opponent while he is still on the ground. Although this might not be an 
exact translation, it's sure easier to type "okizeme" than typing "hitting 
an opponent while on the ground." Well enough definitions, let's get on to 
some okizeme tactics.

Lee doesn't have many moves that hit low enough to hit opponents while they 
are on the ground. This can be a problem when you are going against sleepers 
(Sleepers are basically people that stay on the ground and wait for a failed 
attempted to hit them and counterattack). Fortunately for Lee, his okizeme 
game can used pretty far away rather than being close up with other 
characters.

One of the best moves to use for his okizeme game is his spinning slide. 
Since the motion involves a f,f,N input, this move can be used at a 
relatively safe distance. A move that also involves his f,f,N motion are the 
shredder kicks mixups. This can really get to people who attempt to roll 
forward or back in an attempt to get back into a fighting position.

Lee does have a few okizeme moves that require Lee to be at close range. Lee 
can also use his d/b+3, which hits grounded opponents at close range. Lee 
can also use his silver tail to hit people while they are on the floor. And 
if your timing is right, you may be able to get off a silver demon if they 
try to get up off the floor right away. He can also do the dragon slide from 
crouch position to even add cause more chaos.

One of the riskier okizeme moves would be the shin kick combo. It can be 
used on people that try to get up by rolling back or forward. The problem 
occurs when you try to use it when an opponent tech rolls. When this 
happens, you expose your side while doing the laser edge kicks, giving 
opponents the perfect opportunity to counterattack. The riskiest move in his 
okizeme game has got to be the rainbow flip. This is that one flip where Lee 
leaps into the air and basically lands on his opponent back first. This is 
an EXTREMELY dangerous move to perform. If they try a roll back or forward, 
you will get them if you do the one that goes straight up at close range. 
The u/f one should only be used if your opponent is extremely far away or 
tries to tag in his/her partner.

---Lee as an Anti-Tagger---

Anti-Tagger is a term that I came up with after people began to use the tag 
button to escape and try to make a comeback with their partner character. 
This really gets me annoyed, since I can wear people down very quickly with 
Lee and all of a sudden be forced to do all that over with against a  new 
character. Good thing that Namco added that little defect where you can't 
block while your tagging out, thus making my job at doing damage much 
easier.

The first move that I always do when people tag out is go for a low hit. 
This includes the shin kick combo. Since people can't block low when they 
tag out, they believe that they can stop me from rushing with a jab. Well 
whadda you know? Doing the laser edge kicks at that time causes a CH, 
guaranteeing that all the hits connect, causing a great deal of damage. The 
shin kick mixups really screw with people's minds, especially the 
d+4,N,4,u+3. Another good move that I like to do is the silver whip. This 
moves comes out extremely quickly and is capable of allowing you to perform 
a silver demon.

Speaking of unblockables, Lee can use his to discourage people from tagging 
in. One of my favorite things to do on people is to simply go for the silver 
cyclone. Since he ducks during the charge up, he can avoid most high 
attacks. Mid attacks could be avoided, but I need to confirm that at a later 
time. His silver fang unblockable also is a good and devastating move. It 
has a great deal of power, plus it can be cancelled, allowing Lee to get 
into a defensive stance when a person gets in before the punch is launched.

*Netsu List*
An integral part of any team is the consideration of the netsu power up. For 
those who are unaware, netsu is the state when your character has flashing 
red border around their life bar. The way that you get a netsu power up is 
when the character on screen gets hit a certain amount of times, your 
partner will become enraged and gain strength. During a netsu power up, the 
damage that your blows infict is increased by 30%. Taking Lee into 
consideration, he takes only 5 hits to gain a netsu powerup when off screen. 
There are, of course exceptions to that 5 hit rule.

Note: 0's indicate that the character doesn't get a netsu at all.

With Lee off screen-
Jin		0
Kazuya	7
Devil		7
Ogre		0
True Ogre	0

With Lee on screen-
Heihachi		0
Kazuya		0

*Tag Teams*
This section provides a semi-complete analysis of tag partners that Lee can 
use. It includes general tips on using the pair, a few of my favorite tag 
juggles, and my own opinions on the team.

--Jack-Types (Jack-2, P-Jack, Gun Jack, Kuma, Ganryu)--
It is my personal belief that the Jack-Types are the best team up with 
characters with low stamina, like Ling or Paul.  So they might be a little 
bit on the slow side; their power and high stamina make up for it. At times 
I think that their high stamina can make up for both themselves and their 
partner. That is true in the case of Lee paired up with a Jack-Type. Lee 
also helps out a Jack by making  up for a Jack's lack of speed. Since they 
have such different types of style, your opponent would be confused at what 
to do with each of your partners. Whenever I want to go on the defensive, I 
put in a Jack and turtle a little bit while Lee recovers some lost health.

--Mishima Martial Artists (Heihachi, Kazuya, Jin, Devil/Angel)--
Family affairs... Not much to say in this topic since I'm not really good 
with the Mishima family (just can't get that damn crouch dash!!). But I do 
have one thing to say: if you know how to use a Mishima and team up with 
Lee, your set for some ass-kicking and smack-down laying. The Mishima's 
(except for Devil and on some level, Kazuya) are excellent jugglers. And 
rememeber the blazing kick? A class 1 juggle starter. Can you say sickness? 
I knew you could.

Ex. Lee - d,d/b+4~5
    Jin - b+1+4 (short)

Jin also gets bonus points for being able to counter.

--Williams Sisters (Nina, Anna)--
This team reaffrms Lee's status as the pimp in TTT. Both of the Williams 
Sisters are excellent pokers and bulldogs, much like Lee. But unlike Lee, 
they also are some of the best jugglers in the game. Combine that with the 
blazing kick, one of the best class 1 juggle starters in the game, and you 
have quite a formidable team to reckon with. Another bonus that the Williams 
Sisters have is a counter, which is quite effective due to the fact that not 
many people know they have one. But they also have something in common with 
Lee, extremely low stamina. So be careful using this team, unless your 
juggling and defensive skills are top notch

--Chang Family (Michelle, Julia)--
Another team that reaffirms Lee's pimp status, although him teaming up with 
a girl nearly half his age may not look that good.  Once again, I must make 
a reference to Lee's blazing kick and the Changs excellent juggling 
capabiities. They also have extremely low stamina. One thing that I find odd 
about the Changs is the fact that they are excellent at not poking 
consistently with a variety of moves, but they can also are excellent at 
counter-attacking thanks in part of their extremely fast moves. And when 
they counter attack, they usually send them across the screen, such is the 
case with the elbow f,f+1 and their body blow  WR+2_FC,D/F+2. This can be a 
blessing or a curse depending on how you play.

--Kickboxers (Bruce, Bryan)--
Sweet lordy! This guys can lay more smack down than the Mishimas when their 
paired up with Lee! First of all, Bruce has those god forsaken triple knee 
that can lob off so much energy it isn't funny. He also has a nice variety 
of canned strings that can murder people who aren't paying any attention. 
The same can be said for Bryan, although I personally think that Bryan can 
fight autonomously without Lee, along with everyone else (The man ran 
through a hail of gunfire and shot by a tank, only to throw the turrent 
right into those Tekken Force soldiers). Bryan also has a few launchers that 
are quite useful. Basically, these guys are some of the best jugglers in the 
game, they just need a high enough juggle starter. <cough> <cough> blazing 
kick <cough> level 1 <cough> juggle starter.

--Manji Clan (Yoshimitsu, Kunimitsu)--
I've been a Yoshimitsu fan from WAY back. Back in my T2 days, I was quite a 
fomidable opponent with him. Nowadays, people wipe the floor with me when I 
use Yoshi. So some of these tips may not be as good as the others.

Yoshi has some of the fastest moves in the game (standard jab, yoshi flash, 
fubuki) so he is quite an excellent chipper. He also has some of the best 
juggling skills I have seen in quite a long time (Tragic, we need to talk 
about those juggle movies...). He also sports some pretty wicked 
unblockables that can annoy the hell out of people. My personal favorite 
unblockable is the flea stance d+1+2, which now has been augmented with that 
flea headbutt 1+2 to pick people off. A little sick trick that I theorized 
off of this is Lee's knee bash throw~tag,flea, flea headbutt. So the inputs 
would be: f,f+3+4~5, d+1+2,1+2. Can someone please confirm this for me.

I also recall my days using Kunimitsu in T2. Those were some of the worst 
matches that I have EVER had. But now things have changed and Kuni, like 
most other players from T2, have undergone dramatic changes.
She now has more juggle starters, some new unblockables, and a new set of 
outfits. Those new outfits, however, concern me due to Kuni's... uh... 
history (recall T1). I still think that she still has many similarities to 
Yoshi.

Sorry if I started rambling just a bit. Now down to business. The Manji's 
are both excellent jugglers in their own right. Their various sets of moves 
and confusing stirngs are some of the longest, as well as toughest to block, 
in the game. Their variety in unblockables make up for Lee's lack there of 
(two only?). Once again, Lee's blazing kick comes to play.

Here's a juggle that isn't for the feint of heart with Lee and Yoshi:

Lee - d,d/d+4~5
Yoshi - f,F+1+4

It's a major crowd pleaser, but if you screwed up... let's say your friends 
would ask you to get out of the car and walk home.

More teams to come in the next update...
