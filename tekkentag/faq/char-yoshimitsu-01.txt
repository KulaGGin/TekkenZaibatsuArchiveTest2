Okay, so I finally made my own FAQ for this wacky guy.  Why?  Well, I think
he's just the coolest character in the game, even since T2.  He probably has 
the biggest movelist, and has totally unique arsenal of moves unlike any 
other character.  For this FAQ, I have clipped the Movelist from Catlord's 
FAQ and made changes/updates to it.  If you need to know what the conventions 
mean, download the full FAQ at 
http://www.tekken.net/catlord/ttt/tttmoves.txt.  I also suggest visiting the 
Zaibatsu site at http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com  I have split the FAQ into the 
following sections:

***NOTATIONS***
I use the standard notations of the Tekken community.  However, if you are 
unfamiliar with them, please see Catlord's movelist for complete
details.  I'll include a few less common ones here:
_    Underscore, same as "OR". I.E., (f+3)_(f,f+4) is f+3 or f,f+4
CD   means crouch dash, the motion being f,N,d,d/f on the joystick/controlpad.
[ ]  Brackets mean the enclosed commands are optional
( )  Parentheses mean the enclosed commands whiff on purpose so the rest of
     the combo/commands will execute or connect for desired effect.  They also
     separate options in combos with the _ character.
*    Asterisk indicates that there will be additional notation for that move
     (TECHNIQUES section-- indicates moves not normally on Catlord's list)
ASAP (As soon as possible), basically enter the command within the first few
     frames of opportunity
WGF  The motion of f,n,d,d/f+2
TGF  The motion of f,n,d,d/f+1

|MOVE BREAKDOWN Section|
------------------------
Ahhh, the fun part.  Yoshi has a modest array of juggles.  I say modest in 
that he has a good number of them, but most fall in the difficult category to 
pull off(depending on quality of the arcade stick).  Here I will show you the 
actual juggles and the ways to make them easier.  I will list each juggle 
starter and below it a list of possible followups.  Non-juggling attacks will 
also have strategic breakdowns too, including custom strings.  Attacks in 
parentheses ( ), mean they whiff in order for the next hit to connect.  
[Tag] means you can press 5 to make it a tag juggle starter.  

HINT:  Any action requiring # (hold directional), can be done during 
preceeding move.  EX:  Bad breath+sweeps.  During the bad breath, you can be 
holding D/B and hitting 3 rapidly, and he'll immediately go into the sweeps 
ASAP.  This is "buffering", and can be used for anything requiring you to 
hold a directional.  
HINT #2:  Any move requiring FC,d/f, or FC,d/b, is actually not that
complicated.  What the game wants is for you to change into the position
of 'crouch walking', (ie, holding D/F or D/B).  The key is the CHANGING of
position.  So, from a standing position, all you really have to do is press
D/F or D/B and hold it just long enough for your character to start crouch
walking.  This is the required animation for such moves.  Using this technique
will make using Yoshi a lot easier.  Specifically his spinning footsweep,
FC, d/f+3.  From standing position, just press D/F, hold it for about a half
second, and hit 3.  Hope that helps.

b+1, d/b+2, d+1, FC,d/f+3 (aka, SPINIMITSU!(tm))
d/f+1,2,D/B#+2,2,2,2...

Yoshi's famed staple attack.  Get this move down pat.  It's range, windup 
speed, and recovery times are all underestimated.  Excellent after a poke or 
as a retaliatory move.  Also, it works well as a combo ender since you can 
tag with it.  A few notes on the properties of this attack:  First, it causes
a backwards stagger against ducking opponents; a tag-buffered d/f+2 will
always launch them, however.  Second, a tag-buffered d/f+2 causes the
same guard stun imposed by a blocked EWGF, though neither char gets
noticable frame advantage.
-----------------
Kangaroo Kick[TAG]  (SS>f+4~3) (4~3) (UF+3+4, 3+4) (3,d+3+4) (SIT,4) (1+2,4+3)
* B, n, f+1, b+1,1,(1),1, b+1,1,1

* B, n, b+1+4, f+1, d/f+1,2,D/B#+2,2,2,2,2,[2]
B+1+2~any, (d/f+4)_(f,f+4,d+4)
NOTE on *:  All you need to do here is hold back just long enough for Yoshi to
take a tiny step, so that they'll fall in front of Yoshi instead of on top/
behind.  For the last combo, make sure that you use the flash them up as high 
as possible.  This will turn them face down for the rest of the juggle to 
connect.  If you delay it too long, they'll be pushed back out of range.

By itself, this move isn't so great, in that it's easy to see coming and easy 
to block.  However, mixing it up is the key.  If you can anticipate your 
opponent launching a bunch of high attacks (Law's punches, other 10-hits, 
etc), then go for it.  On a hit, the Kick is an excellent juggle for either 
Yoshi or his partner.  Remember, if you still want to do his roo kick out of a
SS, you'll have to press forward first, else you'll get the whirlwind kick.

-----------------
Bad Breath (B+1+2, any),
D/B#+3,3,3,3,f+4

This move avoids all all attacks, and throws!  Amazing eh?  Often an 
opponent will try to throw you after you or he both blocks an attack(s), so 
instead of trying to get out of the throw, just go into this stance, then 
breathe on them and juggle away!  Warning:  Yoshi can be crouch thrown by
King and Gunjack in this stance.
-----------------
Sweeping Kick (FC,d/f+3),
d+1, WS+1, (d/f+4)_(f,f+4,d+4)_(d/f+1,2)

* u+1+2, 1+2, d+4
* u+1+2, f~u/f, (f,f)_(f~u/f)_(1+2, [1, d/f+4_f,f+4])
NOTE *: normally, 1+2 enters the pogo stance, but in this case, since Yoshi
is recovering in a crouch position, the U puts him in the pogo faster than
waiting for him to stand up.  [ ] means this is possible, but I have not
verified it yet.
-----------------
Sword Sweep (FC,d/b,b+1)
D#+1, FC,d/f+3
D#+1, D/B#+3,3,3
d+1, WS+1, d/f+4
d+1, WS+4
d+1, f,f+4
1+2, (1+2,d+4)_(f,f)_(f~u/f, 1+2--techrollable)
  Note--Pogo combo only works if Sword sweep hits close.

Not the best range out of this move, and it has some slow windup time. 
Throw it in maybe once every 1-2 rounds to mix it up.  Best application is to
use it immediately after a ducking jab/poke.  If you want to keep up
the momentum, go for the d+1, f,f+4 juggle, which can set you up for some
okizeme (thanks to Shauno for the tip).  This move avoids d+1 jabs, since
they hit special mid.
-----------------
Dodging Uppercut[TAG] (SS+2),
1,2,1
f+1, (f,f+4)_(f,f+3,1)_(d/f+4)
f+1, d/f+1,2,D/B#+(2),2,(2),2,(2),2
f,f+4
d/f+4

Although a decent move for Yoshi to juggle with (it leaves opp. face down),
chances are you'll get better results if you use it as a tag-juggle opener.
Use sparingly as well, since the recovery time is just long enough to eat
a retaliation if blocked.  As like all of his SS attacks, it can be delayed
forever, which is often the best application (wait til the SS completes).
Interesting NOTE:  If you sidestep AWAY from the screen (into the background),
and press tag, the tag-partner will enter much sooner than if you SS towards
the screen.  Remember this, since this can make all the difference in precise
timing-required tag-juggles.
------------------
Sidestep Hilt Upper[CH] (SS+1),
f+1, B+1,1,1, B+1, (f+3)_(f,f+4)
f+1, B+1,1,1, d/f+2[TAG]

Probably the best of Yoshi's new moves.  Unless it completely misses, it's
safe to execute.  It causes a backwards block-stagger when blocked, juggles
on a counterhit, and does decent damage on a normal hit, with good priority.
Since it can be grossly delayed after a sidestep, it can be used as a last
second attack if your SS gives you good positioning.  Even though he hits
with the hilt, you still need to chicken it against reversers.
-----------------
Sword Uppercut (CLEAN HIT d+1+2)
f+1, B+1,1,1, B+1, f+3
d/f+1,2,D/B#+2,2,2,2,2

There really isn't an optimum time to use this attack, exept immediately
after a 2+4 throw.  It's slow windup and recovery are both undesirable,
and it does miniscule damage.
-----------------
Backfist (f+2 OR d/f+1,2 OR BK 2),
f,f+3+4,1+2,3+4 *
d/f+2, d/f+2, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, f,f+4_3
d/f+2, b+1,(1),1, b+1,(1),1,(1),1, f,f+4_3
* The first hit of the shark attack hits always, but only on a CH will all 3 
connect.  Also, after the 1st hit, your opponent can duck the last 2 hits 
easily.  100% Damage combo with Netsu.

Another Yoshi staple attack.  Best application is when you anticipate a
tag-switch, since they can't block during the run-in animation.  Another
good time to use this is after a few pokes, baiting your opponent into
thinking it's safe to attack.  This move has good range but less than
desirable recovery.  If it is blocked frequently, try adding the D/B+2,2,2...
afterwards to catch over-eager punishers.
-----------------
Sword Flash (b+1+4)
1+2, 1+2 
1+2, f~u/f~1+2, [f+1, f,f+4] *

* The combo can be techrolled after the pogo hop if you don't have absolute 
precision timing.  The difference will be that the pogohop will hit in midair 
instead of on the ground.  If you miss the midair hit, they can techroll 
before you land.  However, if they roll f, b, or try to get up immediately, 
the headbutt will score.  It is suggested to only attempt this until your 
opponent catches on, then go for the 1st juggle for more guaranteed results.
The last two hits I haven't been able to do myself, but are possible with
absolute precision timing.

This move now has amazing priority.  The best applications is when your 
opponent is flush against you trying to attack.  You'll find this is easier 
when you run up and do the flash against a tagging opponent (they can't stop 
running-usually), or after a blocked move... rush in and sword flash... if 
they try to throw or "poke", they'll meet the flash.  Thanks to Shauno for
the strat against tag-ins.

d/f+2~5
5, f,f,N+4

Although not a juggle per se, this combo is guaranteed if the kick hits CH.
The pro's for this move are that it has good range, decent damage, and
pretty safe recovery.  The downside is that it has a slow windup time and
hits high.  However, this move should be used in anticpation of an attack.
Like the other SS moves, it can be delayed like crazy.  You can wait until
his SS is complete and still execute this move.  The UP in the command for
the pogo attack combo is to ensure its execution.  Otherwise, the game will
interpret the attack as f,f,N+1+2, which is basically f,f,N+2, which is
f,f+2!  Heh.  Wierd stuff.
------------------
[Flying]Crosschop (FU/FT, b,b+3+4) OR (Tag, f,f, N+1+2)
1_2, D/B#+3,3,3,3,3_d/f+4_f,f+4
1, b+1,1,1, b+1, f+3
NOTE:  The trick is to press either punch fast enough to hit them out of the 
guard stun created by the blocked crosschop.  The first version (FU/FT) is 
always guaranteed.  The second (tag dive) is slightly different:  they must 
block it near the end of the animation to give you enough frame advantage.  
The juggle created is very minor (basically they just start falling down), 
so only a quick ender will work, as listed above.



------------------
NON-JUGGLE SECTION
------------------
Elbow Smash/Runthrough (f,f>2 CH)
Use this whenever you can anticipate an attack and score the CH.  Don't use 
this too often, however, it is a decent poke.  Also, on a CH, you can go into 
the sit down, but since he doesn't meditate, I don't use it.  A more tactical 
option is to go right into the 1+2+3+4 chi powerup while still backturned, 
then turn around.  Your next hit will be a CH, which can lead to all kinds of 
fun;)  NOTE:  There is an optional delay on this move, which lasts up until
Yoshi returns to completely neutral position from the f,f, dash.
--------------
Jumping Kneebutt (f,f+4 or f,f,N~f+4)
An excellent and quick knockdown interruptor.  This attack hits mid, and on 
anything but a glance, will knockdown your opponent.  Make sure you use this 
to interrupt 10-hits starting at a distance, charging unblockables, or at any 
time you wish to knock your opponent out of hard-to-avoid attacks.  This move 
is also an excellent juggle finisher.  Recently discovered is the ability to
cancel the beginning of his jumping knee into his kangaroo kick.  Only in the
first few frams of the knee animation can this be done, however.
--------------
Uppercut/Turning Backfist (d/f+1,2, [D/B#+2,2,2,2,2,2)
An excellent deception move.  Most people who don't know Yoshi will think 
he's finished after the 1st uppercut.  The backfist sets them up for all 
sorts of unpleasant damage.  HOWEVER... against skilled opponents, this may 
be dangerous.  Be sure to buffer your chicken reversal escape for the 
backfist (in this case, f+2+4).  And, for mixup-sake, you might consider
adding the D/B#+2,2... string to discourage any responses after the backfist.
--------------
Sommersault Swordslash (qcf+1)
A great move to pull from a dash distance or further.  Most people don't 
sidestep or not in time.  NOTE:  This move is reversable and unchickenable by 
Nina, Anna, Jin, Jun, and Wang.  ALSO... you can perform this as a tag-
cancel.  As soon as you tag to bring in Yoshi, immediately perform this move 
and he'll stop running to do the attack.
--------------
Ducking punch+Followups (d+1)
The d+1 is a quick way to poke your opponent low.  You can hold down to stay 
crouched after the punch.  Easily follow up with the following:
WS+2        (JUGGLE STARTER!  See juggle section)
WS+1        (Use for a faster rising poke than WS+4 or WS+2)
WS+4
FC,b+1      (JUGGLE STARTER!)
FC,d/f+3     (JUGGLE STARTER!)
--------------
Meditate+Followups (d+3+4) (1+2, d+3+4) (1+2, f,f, 3+4)
Lure your opponent into thinking he can hit you easily while sitting in life-
gaining mediation.  As your opponent rushes in and before the attack, tap f 
or b and he'll begin teleporting.  Just make sure you time it early so the 
teleport will execute before they land an attack (ie, in anticipation of an 
attack).  This will put you right behind your opponent.   And if they are 
commited to an attack, you can rush in an throw, or do his other various 
opponent-backturned combos.  Remember, you can link into the meditation after 
pogo rushes.  So... after you've mowed over them, sit down for some quick 
healing before they know what's going on!
--------------
Savior Boot! (d/f+4)
Wow, what a fast and far ranging poke.  This move is about as quick (slightly 
less) than Lee's frontkick poke.  Also, it serves as a decent juggle 
finisher.  If your opponent is annoying you with little pokes, poke right 
back, and with range!  Indeed, it is slower than Tekken 3, but still 
worthwhile.
--------------
Pogo Stick+followups (1+2)
If you are fighting a low-hitting player, go for this move.  It's great 
okizeme when followed up with f,f dashes on downed opponents. Also, if 
your opponent bumps into the sword, they'll fall backwards.  You can chain 
his FLEA HEADBUTT (1+2) for a quick juggle!  If you do the pogo rushes, chain 
it to his 3+4 mediation as just about every time your opponent will roll away 
from the pogo stick rushes after they connect.  You'll get a few bounces and 
some life before they completely recover!  And... do the headbutt when you 
suspect they'll try to high-hit you out of it.  It's actually a juggle!  
Don't forget he can go right down into meditate sit, and mix it up into a 
kangaroo kick and low spinning backfists too.
--------------
Lunging Kick and Slash (f,f+3,1)
This is one of the best attacks Yoshi possesses.  You can mix it up alot to 
keep your opponent wincing.  Do the slash several times after the kick, then 
mix it up by not doing the slash, and instead, go for a throw or ducking jab 
see Custom Combo Section).  Just make sure that the kick is blocked (for 
guard stun) or hits, otherwise, if it misses, Yoshi is wide open before the 
slash.
--------------
Hilt Takedown (2+4)
By itself, this throw already a great attack.  First of all, the escape is 2, 
and much of the time people will try to escape by hitting just 1.  Secondly, 
the throw leaves you a bunch of okizeme opportunities, plus some zany, out of 
this world juggles!  I will list them below:
1+2, f,f, (3+4) [Use the meditation when you anticipate a back-roller or a 
                 slow-riser]
d/b+1
D/B+3,3,3,3  (Not all hit)
u/f+3+4, b+1, 4,
NOTE:  For the flipstomp combo to work, your opponent must not roll into the 
stomp.  The point is to cross over them so Yoshi will back up towards them 
with the backflip kick.  Following the kick are the juggles listed.
  If backflip Blocked, use the quick 2+4 turn throw, or see BACKTURNED section
  If backflip hits:
    (delayed) 1, f,f+4
    (delayed) 3_4
    turn around, d/f+4
    u+4_3
    d+1+4 *
*  You MUST perform the d+1+4 suicide juggle ASAP after the backflip hits, or 
it whiffs.
---------------
Shark Attack+Followups (f,f+1+2)
1+4         Turning Life Siphon.  Use only against block-turtles.
b+3+4       Quick Spin away dodge, followed by a throw attempt.
  ,2+4        The throw will be a sidethrow if they don't quickly face you.
d/b+2,N+2   Spin away Crouching Fist into standing Turning Backfist

By itself this move is less than mediocre, however, the followups are what 
makes it so valuable.   Mix it up to keep your opponent guessing (and 
hurting).  Make sure to start the attack from dash distance or further, as it 
is easily interruptable up close.  For the moves to work, you must input
the command immediately after the Shark Attack hits or is blocked (HINT: it's
easier if you simply input the command several times for accuracy).
----------------
Back-Turned(BK) Mixups (f,f+1+2) (f,f+1+4,N) (SIT, f_b from distance)
u/f+4  (Jumping Turn Kick--juggles below)
  f+1, b+1,1,(1),1, (f,f+4)_(3)_(f,f+3,1)
  f+1, b+1,1,(1),1, b+1,1,1
  d/f+1,2,D/B#+2,2,2, f+4
d+1    (Hits LOW, begin FC Mixups in Custom Strings Section)
2      (Turning Backfist, Begin OBT Combos)
2+4    (Quick Turnaround throw)
d+1+4  (Fast hitting Suicide attack, can be avoided with Opp, b,b!)

Use these strings if you decide not to employ a true Combo from the Shark
Attack, or feel you're opponent will freeze up after seeing the f,f+1+4,N.
-----------------
Command Low Parry (d+1+3 or d+2+4)
As you know, the low parry's primary purpose is to deflect a low hit.
However, used intelligently, it can be a powerful tool to put Yoshi in
a better attack position.  

Firstly, any character can cancel their command Low Parry into a FC,d/f or a 
FC,d/b move.  This is useful because you don't actually have to crouch in 
order to do FC moves.  The only move Yoshi has to take advantage of this is 
FC,d/f+3.  So in essence, you can do d+1+3~d/f+3 and pull out his sweeping 
kick without entering crouch stance.

Secondly, the Low Parry can be used to stop a 10hit string or any string
where you have the opportunity to input d+1+3.  Remember, everyone has the
universal d/f low parry, which is better only in that it has no windup
animation (I suggest you learn to use it on reaction instead of d+1+3 for
purposes of speed, anyways).  There are no guarantees after a parried low
punch, so I suggest going for one of his 3 throws (you still have frame adv.).
When you actually parry a low kick, you have certain guaranteed followups that
cannot be blocked:
Low Kick Parry
d/f+2   (Staggers, does not juggle)
d/f+2~5 (A tag buffered d/f+2 DOES juggle out to his partner!)
d/f+4
f,f+4

------------------
***TURNING SUICIDE*** (f,F+1+4)
THE BIG ONE!  This is Yoshi's best move, I think.  Yes, it hurts him too, but 
here's the trick.  In TTT, there is the "Anger" or "Netsu" powerup.  Pick 
Yoshi as your 2nd character and have him wait to tag in.  In 4 hits of your 
current character, Yoshi will "powerup".  Come in, and force your opponet to 
defend briefly, then go for this move.  The suicide+netsu powerup does almost 
90% damage!!  And... it gets better!  There are 3 applications of the suicide 
attack. 
1)  Winning the round and living:  make sure your opponent won't be able to 
survive the hit and you will (ie you have more than 50% life and they have 
less than 60).  Quick and easy win.  Plus, it's a crowd pleaser.
2)  Winning the whole match on double KO:  win the first round, and on the 
second, do the suicide and make sure it'll kill them.  Doesn't matter if 
you'll die too, because on a double-ko, you both get a win.  If you already 
have 1 win and they have 0, you win the whole match! (2 to 1).  NOTE:  you 
can also do this if you both have 1 win (ie on the final round), HOWEVER, 
make sure that you are the defending champion (you were on the machine 
before your opponent), or if you both start the game at the same time, you're 
on the 1st player side.  The game awards the win to the defending champion in 
the occurance that there's a double ko on the final round.
3)  If the turning suicide barely misses (and I mean it's close), most of the 
time your opponent will think it's over and just let you fall.  If you have 
won the first round, and missing the suicide will leave you near death, go 
for broke!!  Yoshi can do a second stab, so do it!  It's f,F#+1+4, f,f.  He 
will actually back up a full step and stab again.  I've actually 
won whole matches by missing the first stab, surviving it, backing up, and 
stabbing again for the double ko.




---------
TAG MOVES
---------
Yoshi has an interesting, if not somewhat limited arrary of tag-in attacks.  
He has his standard tag attacks most characters have, as well as his own.
----
These are performed immediately after pressing TAG--
--------------
Cross Chop (f,f, N+1+2)
An excellent tag in attack for any character really.  It has several bonuses.  
First, if it hits, it knocks your opponent down.  If it is blocked, it 
creates long enough guard stun to do the special guard stun juggle (See JUGGLE 
section above).  Lastly, it's a special mid, meaning it will also hit 
grounded opponents.  So, if Yoshi's partner performs a juggle-tag that would 
otherwise be too fast for Yoshi to take advantage of (they fall fast or the 
juggle is low), then you can pounce on them with this move.  If your opponent 
is far (out of dash distance), this is the move of choice, as it has some 
windup time.  If they're close, though, go for the knee.
---------------
Jumping Knee (f,f, N+4)
Not as useful, however, it can catch opponents unexepectedly if they're 
waiting to attack you as you tag in.  Although, if Yoshi's partner does a tag 
juggle that leaves them too low (but close) for a normal juggle, go for the 
knee.  Otherwise, if they're far away, use the crosschop.
----------------
Sommersault Swordslash Tag Cancel (qcf+1)
Same as the normal move, but it cancels his run in animation very quickly.  
However, the move itself is not changed... so it will still have it's slight 
windup time and can still be sidestepped/reversed, etc.  Use only to mix up 
the game.  This move CAN hit targets launched by class 1 juggles(the highest 
juggle) if timed precisely as Yoshi enters, up to 3 hits, depending on timing.
----------------
Tag Cancel (u~u/b)
For most characters, a tag cancelling is a very powerful tool, but for those
(Like Yoshi) who also do backflips, the action becomes almost moot and
pointless.  Tag cancels are used for two purposes:  preventing your opponent
from being able to take avantage of your tag-in run animation, and to execute
slow yet powerful attacks in juggles (ie buying you extra time).  Seeing this,
the only real strategy for this technique then is to avoid your opponents
anti-tag attacks... although you can still be hit out of the backflip.
-----------------
Tag Juggles
See the Tag Team Partners section for universal and specific Tag juggles.



--------
STRATEGY
--------
Against Defensive Players
-------------------------
It's safer to use riskier moves, especially unblockables as these players 
will block expecting a combo or some such.  By far the easiest to defeat.  Go 
for the suicide when it'll be a sure win, and mix up 10hit combos.  Also, 
rush in and use bad breath or the low spinning sweep to start juggles.  If 
they like to duck alot, go for the Yoshi uppercut or kneebutt.

Against Offensive
-----------------
It's hard to play a defensive Yoshi, but your best guess is to use alot of 
pokes here.  d/f+4, f,f+4, f+1, f,f+2 are decent pokes.  Also, get a hang for 
his sidestep game and use his ss+1 or ss+2 whenever you see an opening.  If 
you can, go for the d+1 punch then the FC, mixups.

Against Mashers
---------------
Most mashers will attack even at a distance, so try and go for his qcf+1 
sommersault slash, d/b+1 slash and if feeling lucky, his b,b+1 lunge stab.   
They won't bother to avoid it, heh.  Also, against Eddy style mashers, the 
f,f+4 knee is a good interruptor.  The f,f+3,1 is good against rising 
mashers, just make sure the kick doesn't miss.  Finally, mashers rarely know 
10-hit combos, so go for his 4 sword slash combo frequently.

Against Yoshi
-------------
Fighting against Yoshi isn't so difficult once you know what to expect.  
First, beware Yoshi when he tags in during Netsu powerup and you have less 
life than he does.  Experienced players may go for the fatal turning suicide, 
so sidestep frequently.  If you see him do a d/f+1 uppercut, keep blocking, 
cuz his backfist may follow.  His f,f+1+2 shark dive can be followed by some 
nasty tricks, make sure you 1 or d+1 before he can link to it.  If you ever 
get your back turned to Yoshi, DON'T HIT ANY BUTTONS--especially after he 
hits you with a backfist!  A shark dive into your back on a CH is pretty much 
round over.  However, if the shark dive is used against your back, just hold 
down to avoid the last 2 hits.  Just don't try to be smart and d+1 out of it.  
If Yoshi goes into bad breath stance, try to do a long-range attack... 
getting close is too dangerous, and never think you can throw him unless 
you're playing King or Gun Jack (crouch throws work).  Beware his f,f+3,1 
kick'n'slash.  If you manage to block the kick, you can sidestep the slash 
easily.  A side (sometimes back) throw is yours for free.  Yoshi starts 
ducking and poking, it's safe to duck and block, because numerous low attacks 
may follow.  Just be wary, his WS+2 uppercut will juggle just as well as his 
df+2, and he can also do a WS+4.  If you are at a distance from Yoshi, don't 
rush or charge, as he can copter over your charge, catch you in a fan blade 
or a jumping knee.  Also, watch him closely.  If he suddenly sommersaults, 
he's going for his spinning sommersault slash.  Sidestep to safety.    
If you're playing as a reverser, don't bother trying to reverse his 10-hits, 
as it is easy to chicken a 10-hit with Yoshi.  Only attempt to reverse his 
unblockables (not Paul), because Yoshi cannot chicken out of reversals then.
And, whenever Yoshi Tags in, be wary of trying to take avantage of his run-in
animation, as he can cancel it with the b+1+4 sword flash as soon as he enters!
Use only long range, safe attacks to penetrate the flash.

Against Specific Characters
---------------------------
Briefly, I will discuss the common fighting strategies used by the most
popular characters and ways to employ good offense and defense to defeat
them.

Mishimas (Devil/Angel, Jin, Heihachi, Kazuya)
 The first of the top three tiers of cheese, as I'd say it.  The Mishimas,
when played right, are incredibly difficult to defeat.  There are several
staple attacks used by Mishima players, so I'll list each and how to
overcome them.
 WGF/EGWF--When used correctly, you cannot see this move coming.  Don't worry
about trying to stop or interrupt the move itself, or even bothering to SS.
The only way you will ever beat this move is to predict and prevent it from
executing.  Against Devil/Hei/Kazuya, your best bet is a poking game, mixed 
up with crouch guarding and throw attempts.  Basically, you want to knock
them out of the f,n,d~d/f motion with a quick poke.  Up close, d+1 is good,
but from a distance, you'll want to use his d/f+4.  Against Jin, remember
to chicken the savior boot.  And, against all of them, crouch guarding is
quite safe as long as they stick to WGF and hellsweeps.  After a few blocks,
they may go for mid hitting moves such as the Twin Pistons or the Laser
Cannon Combos, so don't turtle too much.  Even though they are safe after
you block a WGF, you DO have frame advantage, so use it to begin your poking
strings.  Against EGWF however, you'll be pushed back.  Here, study your
opponent.  If he/she keeps doing EGWF, backstep (b,b) to allow the move to
whiff.  If they answer this with a wavedash, d/f+4 them out of it.  The point
here is to put THEM on the defensive so that they don't get WGF opportunities.
Finally, Jin's WGF hits high unless it's tag buffered (which is rare), so
be prepared to punish a whiffed WGF with a WS+2 or WS+4.
 HELLSWEEPS--Again, crouch guarding between these and WGF/EGWF is quite safe.
If you block the first sweep, you are usually guaranteed a WS+4.  If they
miss the first hellsweep and are spinning for the second, just press 1+3/2+4
while holding down and you'll get a low kick parry guaranteed followup.
 WS ATTACKS--All of the Mishimas have nasty WS moves, but fortunately, they
all hit mid and are easily blocked.  Since none of them have any dangerous
FC attacks, you are relatively safe guarding standing up.  As such, don't
expect more than a d+1 or a d+4 here.  If you do see a d+1 jab, keep blocking,
since this is usually a linker for a WS attack.  However, if you are quick
enough, you can usually SS their WS hits.  Just clue in to any patterns
they use.  Also, it's pretty dangerous attempting to interrupt their WS
game, so play it safe and don't go for the CH.  If you insist, use d/f+4
or your own d+1 in retaliation.
 1,1,2/1,2,2/1,2,4--The Mishima poking game.  Here, you're safe crouch
guarding until the last hit, which hits mid.  Either stand up to guard it
or poke them out of it with a quick (FC)+1.  If you block the string
standing, it's safe to keep standing, except against Kazuya.  If you
see him 1,2, you can bet on the 4 ender.  Unless you have lightning
reflexes(low parry), block it low, then d+1 into your FC mixup strings.
Note however, that the whole string can be avoided in a crouching guard,
which is usually a safe position against Kazuya anyways (again beware
his twin pistons/gut punches).

Changs
Known for their incredible speed and safe-recoveries, the Changs can be
incredibly frustrating and annoying to challenge.  Primarly, you need to
watch out for their elbows (f,f+1 and FC,d/f+2), hopkicks, and kick pokes
and sweeps (4,4,d+4, FC,d/f+4, b+3-Julia).
 f,f+1--The infamous elbows, the staples of the Changs.  Against characters
with high-mid parries (Law, Anna, Xiaoyu) these aren't as dangerous, but
since Yoshi doesn't have this option, you have to really play carefully.
The thing to remember here is that if you block a f,f+1, 9 times out of 10
the Changs will have frame advantage over anything you do, and usually is
some kind of juggle.  Basically, after a blocked f,f+1, you should expect
one of the following:  1~1[~1, juggle]; d/f+2,1(juggle); CH 1,2,1(juggle),
4,4,d+4_4_1; u/f+4.  At any rate, your best bet is to continue blocking,
and capitalize on any mistakes.  If they do all of 1~1~1, throw them or
start a d+1, FC mixup string.  If you see the first kick of the 4,4...
string, crouch guard, and stay there.  Few people use the uppercut finisher,
and if you're quick you can see it coming and stand to block it, then punish
with a throw, d+1 FC mixup string or d/f+4 poke.  Just remember, after
the elbow, you do NOT want to duck, unless they become predictable with
throws.  The best way to overcome the elbow (smart players abuse it)
is to stay out of range and let her whiff it, then immediately move into
a custom string, preventing her from unleashing another one.  F,f+4, d/f+4
and SS(whiffed elbow)+1 or +2 or +4 are good options.  Also, b,b+1~1, the
spinning fan strike as well as b+1+2~any will often trick elbow-abusers
into attacking.  Don't be afraid to backdash and SS alot until an elbow
misses, and be ready to keep them on the defensive with custom strings.
 b+3 with Julia--A nasty little sweep with Julia.  If you get hit on a CH,
expect to be juggled for awhile.  If it hits normally, you can usually
expect a FC,d/f+3,4 (it comes out fast!) or a WS+4 or a u/f+4.  If you
are quick enough, however, you can d+1 them out of anything except the
WS+4.  Lastly, a well-timed SS can get you to safety as well.  

Lei
 In the right hands, Lei is a non-stop barrage of safe attacks, mixups, and
juggles.  The key to defeating a strong Lei, just like any other strong
character, is to take away their offensive power.  Most of Lei's game
revoles around his rush punches+stances, lay-down position, and hopkicks.
 Rush bunch barrage--His staple attack, the rushes are fast, high priority,
safe, and easily mixed up.  One thing you should note about the rushes:
if Lei cancels into any stance besides panther, you can immediately throw
him before he can hit you.  Remember this.  Although most masters know this
as well, and will always cancel into his panther and from there mix up
the juggle or the double punch low hit.  As always, you'd rather guard
standing and eat the low-punch trip than a juggle.  A low parry is nice,
but not worth it since there are no guarantees after.  You can always
mislead your opponent into thinking you always block high for the first
few times, then parry when he gets predictable.  You can SSL the first
rush punch at the beginning, however it will track you, so SSL again
before trying to attack.  If they use the guard-melting punches and
stop after the 2nd hit, duck, since an u/f+1+2 throw may be coming.  If they
execute all four melts, block low, since his d+1 will sweep you.
 Lay down position--You can pretty well avoid Lei's nastiness if you are
quick to react.  If he lays down right against you, d+3.  If he lays down
still and waits, the d+3 hits ground.  If he immediately goes for the sweep
or roo kick, d+4 will stop that.  If he lays down at a distance then
rolls towards you, you can d+4 him out of the roll, or if fast enough,
f,f+4 out of it as well.  SS are iffy, so only use if you are confident.
 Remember, whenever you knock Lei out of his rolls or rushes, take avantage
and put in your mixup strings.  Don't turtle/duck too much against Lei,
since a hopkick juggle will ruin your lifebar.

Ling Xiaoyu
 I hate Ling.  Sorry, but the only character I hate more is Julia, but I have
good reasons for hating both, heh.  Anyways, Ling is a real bitch (pun
intended, dammit) in the right hands.  Her strengths are her insane speed
and poking ability.  Mainly the phoenix stance (d+1+2) and rain dance (b+3+4),
as well as her SS game make her nearly impossible to hit.
 Phoenix Stance--While down low, you can forget just about all high, mid, and
most low attacks against her.  Only hits that will hit the ground (just like 
Lei) will connect, for the most part.  Against a turtling phoenix, d/b+1, d+3,
D/B+3,3,3..., FC,d/f+3, u/f+3+4,b+1... all seem to work decently.  Most smart
players know not to stay in any one stance too long, so you have to react 
fast. Your best bet is to backdash as SOON as you see her enter the stance, or
SS. If she rolls towards you, d+4 or f,f+4.  Otherwise, the guessing game 
between the sweeps and the launchers will be too difficult.  Your best bet is 
to do far-ranging pokes to punish her for entering the phoenix (d/b+1, 
FC,d/f+3, or u/f+1+2~D).
 Rain Dance--With her back turned, Ling is dangerous if you continue to stand
and block too much.  BK turnaround throws and poking combos will be most
infuriating.  If you see her do her 2,2, pokes duck and d+1 her.  If she
rolls backwards towards you and does the roo kick, block it and begin your
d+1 strings.  Basically you have to really study your opponent here, because
you WILL lose any poking battles since the rolling roo kick comes out fast
and goes underneath.  Your best bet here is to block any 2,1 or 2,2 pokes
and d+1.  If they use the rolling roo or BK 4 alot, don't try to SS, since
both track quite well.  F,f+4, f+1, d+1 and sometimes b+1+4 are your quickest
and simplest retaliation attacks.

CUSTOM COMBOS
-------------
A brief explanation of this section:  the combos listed here are not true
guaranteed combos.  Only after a juggle is mentioned is the rest of the
'combo' guaranteed.  An * indicates the point where the true combo begins.
You'll see what I mean.

f+2(hit), 4~3 (hit Opp back turned)*, b+1+4, f,f+4
SSL, f+2(hits)*, ~f+2~f+2~f+2, d/f+2, (class 3 juggle ender)

TAG TEAM PARTNERS/JUGGLES
-------------------------
**********************************************************************
(THIS SECTION UNDER CONSTANT CONSTRUCTION!  IF YOU HAVE CONTRIBUTIONS,
PLEASE EMAIL THEM TO ME, AND I'LL ADD THEM, CREDIT TO YOU OF COURSE!
THANKS)
**********************************************************************
NOTE:  All tag dives/slides at the end of combos are techable, I only listed
them as optional enders to keep your game momentum going.  Any tag combos
where the partner's 1st command is u~u/b is actually a tag cancel to allow
enough time for the 1st attack to connect.

Standard Yoshi TAG Juggles for:
Class 1
b,b+1~1
4~3~5
QCF+1 (up to 3 hits, depending on exit time of partner)

Class 2
F+1, b+1,1,(1),1, [b+1,] f+3_f,f+4_d/f+2~5,tag slide/dive
b+1, 1, b+1,1,1, f+3_f,f+4
f,f+4, d+1, f,f+4
f,f+4, 1+2,1+2 (pogo techable)
1+2,1+2, d+4 (all techable)
d/f+1,2,D/B#+(2),2,...
* Some Class 2 juggles bring Yoshi in late. In this case, only perform 3 b+1's
  since all 3 hit (any more will whiff and the remaining combo as well).

Class 3
f,f,N+4

Class 4
