Move Name Rating(out of 5 stars)

Grappling Techniques 

GRAPPLING TECHNIQUES
(Front) 1+3 :: Headlock Toss {1}/(Front) 2+4 Throwdown Slam {2} ***:
-What can I say, they are regular throws. Both have normal throw damage 
and lay the opponent near Wang. Personally, I rarely use any throws with Wang. 

(Front) 2+5 :: TAG THROW {2} ***:
-The always useful, but never changing tag throw.

(Front) d/f,d/f+2+4 [~5] :: Waning Moon [Tag] {1+2} **/****:
-Confused by the stars? Try using this throw sometimes. Useful if you
are teamed with a ground thrower (King/Armor King) or with a low hitting power
move/juggler (Paul/Michelle/Ling). Two stars for having to hit d/f twice, four
stars for its usefullness with the before mentioned fighters.

(Front) d/f+1+3+4 :: Whirlwind Toss **:
-Don't even know what the use of it is anymore. It basically ducks under high
hitting moves and tosses the person about half a screen length. Good if you
need distance or a breather to tag, but not worth the time or effort to use.
It would be nice if tagging would put the other character near the opponent...

SPECIAL TECHNIQUES

d/f+1,1 [~5] :: G-Clef Clubfist Cannon [Tag] -Juggles- ****:
This is a good TAG juggle combo, since it tends to hit people up a lot higher when the
tag button is hit. The other good thing about it is, it is a good counter to crouching
players. The first hit comes down on the opponent to surprise. The other way of doing
this combo is 1~1,1. This is one of two rush in hand combos. (the other is the first
3 hits of his ten hit combo) Anyone who has ever used Julia will know the importance of
it. Its not quite as fast as the Changs' combo, but is still as deadly. Use the first
1 as a poke and finish it if you get a CH.

b,b,1 [~5] :: Heaven's Cannon -Juggles- **:
-The only reason I didn't give it one * is it has huge potential seeing as it is not
only unblockable but it launches the person higher that any other juggle. On top of
that it takes off insane damage for a juggle (about 1/2 to 2/3) AND it sets up any one
of Wang's juggles, or anyone else's for that matter. However, actually hitting a person
with it is near impossible unless that person can barely breathe let alone play.

f,f+1+2 :: Double Strike ***:
-This is the first of four similar but yet different moves. This hits like Nina's double
hand lunge strike, and acts about the same. Good for chasing a rolling recovery, or for
hitting a person at medium range. DO NOT USE THIS IN CLOSE. That is for one of the other
four similar moves, the headbutt. Use this sparingly, although it can go under high hits,
it takes a second to start hitting, and can be easily seen coming. Side note, if used in
a juggle, after f+4 for instance, it will toss your opponent across the screen leaving
an openning for a chase or a tag out and slide/cross chop.

d/f+1+2 :: Bowling Ball Fist *****:
-This is a really good thing for Wang, and a bad thing for recovering opponents. This is
one of the only low hitting heavy power moves I can think of. I don't use it much, since
its not fast nor useful 95% of the time. However, in that 5%, it is unmatched in 
importance. The move is a slow moving, almost absolute low hitting fist sweep. It acts
like a street broom by hitting anything in its path. Use: After a person has fallen, it
will hit if the person moves. Learn to use this wisely.

1+2 or SS+1+2 :: HEADBUTT **** or *****:
-The normal headbutt is the second of four similar moves. It also hits medium but it is 
used for close fighting. It will stun on counter-hit (i.e. hit the person before his/her
hit comes out) which is not so useful since using the headbutt in this way is suicidal.
The real use for this is to counter a power move. (A move that leaves the other person 
recovering) This will REALLY frustrate your opponent and make him/her think twice about
abusing power moves.
Ok now for the ss+1+2 which, at one time, I thought it to be useless. Boy was I wrong.
Hit or Block, its just nice. Follow it up with d/b+2 or qcf+2 for almost guaranteed fun.

QCF+2 :: Deathfist *****:
-This is the third of the four similar moves. This has to be one of my all time favorite
moves. Just like Paul's, this move can be one of the most destructive moves you can use,
and I can't think of a more feared or hated move. Need a quick tag move when Wang is
coming in? How about a way to get back in the game. Like the double strike, it hits at 
medium range, but for a lot move power when it counter hits. Use it whenever you feel
someone is coming in with a long/medium range attack, or if the person is recovering. This
is a real Eddie killer :) However, it does not duck high hits, and can be easily 
countered by an experienced player. Please, use it wisely, do not be like me in tekken 2 
and rely on only it. It is a great move, but in can be your undoing.

d/f+2,1 :: Death Push, Sky Uppercut -Uppercut if D-Push hits- ***:
-This can be use primarily as a close range block and attack move, or against low attacks
if you have good timing. I rarely use it, though, since there are better block and hit
attacks, and it places the opponent too far to juggle properly and too close to running
tackle. The one advantage is it can take people by surprise, and it creates time to tag.

f+2 Front Strike :: **:
-This is the fourth of the four similar moves. It has the same range as the deathpunch
but none of the power. It does, however, only move the opponent slightly back allowing a
string of moves there after.(on a counter hit that is) The one good thing about it is it
seems to have good interupt capabilities at a medium range since its a lot quicker then it
looks.


(b+2) :: Punch, Spin Behind then (1+2) :: German Suplex Throw ****:
-I like this move, at least the first half. The spin behind can be a real pain for an
opponent since it is like a stun, but it leaves you behind him/her. The throw may or may
not work, depending on the opponent's reaction time, so use this for an emergency chance
to tag. Another not so nice thing is to set your opponent up. When most people are turned
around in a hurry, they tend to panic and mash 1 or 3, reverse this. I can't tell you how
many times I've been call cheap because of this :) Final Note: It is just a regular RP, so
it can be used at any time a right punch can be used. This is a move that needs to be
mastered since it can save you from a messy tag.

WS+2,1,1 [~5] :: Slice Uppercut, Catapult Combo ***:
-The one good thing about this combo is it comes off while standing, which means it can be
used to create many custom combos. It can follow the double SPINSWEEP or after a LOWSWEEP
instead of using the BOWLEG. This can keep your opponent guessing as to what you are going
to do next. It DOES NOT, however, JUGGLE. It pushes the opponent back to the ground.

d/b+2 [~5] :: FALSE LIFT [Tag] -Juggles- **:
-Slow to rise, slow to attack. This can be used primarily as a block and hit uppercut, but
I don't usually use it alone. "Alone?", you ask. See MIDKICK UPPERCUT.

(F+4) :: PUNT KICK -Juggles- ***:
-This could almost be considered the fifth of the four similar moves, but it has one major
difference: It juggles. The reason it could be the fifth? It works like a close range
block and hit attack. In fact, it can be used the same way as the headbutt. However, DO
NOT use it as a regular attack. Its too slow and easy to counter.

u/f+3+4 :: Earthquake Stomp *:
-Next...

FC,d/f+4,3 :: Lowsweep, Bowleg *****:
-Could there be a more frustrating move to block? I say no. This is the Michelle/Julia
sweep to jump kick move that is, in my opinion, as annoying as Ling's jump to the side,
arms a flailing throw. LEARN THIS KICK. It can be used in so many ways. After the double
SPINSWEEP, or to hit a person during a juggle, or do the lowsweep, negate the bowleg and do
a WS move. The speed and distance are great, and if the opponent doesn't block the sweep,
there is a great chance the BOWLEG will hit. Be sneaky with this, it can frustrate an 
opponent in no time. A bonus thing is when you are playing a reversal freak. He/she will
see the lowsweep and try to counter the bowleg. Chicken buffer this since theres nothing you
can really do after it. FC,d/f+4,(3)(hold 3) f+1. I have caught many a reversal freak with
this since its so easy, and they seem to fall for it all the time.

d/b+4,2 [~5] :: Midkick, Uppercut [Tag] *************************:
-I would have kept going with the stars, but I didn't want to get carried away. This is
your best friend. Learn to use this and your troubles are over. I can't think of a better
juggle move/combo. The d/b+4 alone is useful since it is an absolute low attack (A good way
to frustrate Eddie/Ling/Lei users) and for a simple aggitator. Its not easy to block since he
really doesn't move all that much to do it. Throw it in every so often to throw your oppponent
off. If it connects on a CH use the 2 follow up for a juggle :)

d+4,4_(d+4)_1 :: Spinsweep, Highkick_(Sweep)_Uppercut -Juggles- **** or
4,4,4_(d+4)_1 :: Kick, Spinsweep, Highkick_(Sweep)_Uppercut -Juggles-:
-The four stars are for the d+4,4 combo or the 4,4,d+4 since it allows you to hit twice low
and puts you in a position to use WS+2,1,1 or WS+4 or LOWSWEEP, BOWLEG. This is where
options become plentiful. Custom combos can be a killer in this position. Just mix up
this combo with the before mentioned moves to trick and surprise. Note: see LOWSWEEP section
to increase trickyness. Another great thing is the overall speed and priority of the 4~4 
combo. For some reason it, to me, hits better then the Chang 4~4 but I may just be biased :)
If your opponent is rushing in at medium range, pop this out and stop em cold. DO NOT USE THE
UPPERCUT, avoid it like a restaurant next to a pet store. You will be in much pain if you use
that combo.

WS+4 :: Skyscraper Kick *****:
-Good priority, good distance, and it can catch people rushing in after the KICK, SPINSWEEP,
SPINSWEEP combo. Need I say more?

SS+4 :: PARTING SWEEP **:
-I did like this move until I started using Julia, and now I really detest it. Sure it hits low
and is useful when followed up by low mix-ups, but I sure wish he would just do the ole ch 4
instead. Be carefull using it since it is not impossible to see coming. 

b+(1+3)_(2+4) :: Reversal *****:
-If you don't know what this is or how important it is, LEARN. His are quick and leave the
opponent in a good position for any low hit/combo. Also, his lp reversal is very hard to
chicken, if not imposible. I think the chicken motion is u/f but again thats really hard.

U/F+4 :: Jump Kick Juggler *****:
-Not a true special move, but I had to include it since it is so nice. A juggle move to use
in the block and hit manor. It takes off a good amount of power, and sets up a very damaging
combo. Learn to use it.

b+1+2 :: Indigo Punch -Unblockable- *:
-Funny thing is, this is guaranteed after Paul's f,f+1+2 throw on large characters. Use it
against True Ogre sometime.

211:2:33:3:4:4:1 :: Tenstring:
-No stars because its not useful after the first four hits.

5.110 3

6. What this all means:
-In my opinion, Wang is my favorite character there is. Its true he does resist damage
like King or isn't as well rounded as Jin or Ling, but he has some huge strong points.
It took me a while to get good at him, so expect the same for yourself. Just remember
four things:
6.1 Learn to use (d/b+4,2), this is his best weapon. Use it wisely and you should have
no problem getting out of any situation.
6.2 Learn the custom combos. This guessing game can allow you to frustrate your opponent
beyond belief.
6.3 Be patient, Wang is not a full out offensive person. Learn what moves make your
opponent stagger when his/her attack is blocked and how far it puts him/her back.
This is where the four similar moves, the PUNT KICK, and u/f+4 comes in to play.
6.4 Choose your teammate carefully. Wang works better with a completely different
teammate. You need someone with a lot of core moves to make up for Wang's lack thereof.
Suggestions: Armor King ***** :: Michelle ***** :: King **** :: Ling **** :: Paul *** 

7. Chicken!!
-You know this situation, you're playing and doing well. Some guys puts his two tokens in
and picks Paul and Jin. No prob, you've fought both before. 1~1,1 reversal. FC,d/f+4,3 
reversal. Before you know it you're in the middle of a reversal onslaught. Impossible to
beat? Hah. The art of chickening, at least for those of use who don't have insane relfexs,
is about anticipation. You have to know what moves can will be reversed and what moves can
be easily buffered to set people up. Thats what this is about. Ok, now you're game is off
since you're a little rattled, this guy is reversing everything. What can you do? First a
quick explination. Chickening is a reverse reversal, though a little harder to pull of. If
you are reversed using either 1 or 3 hit f+1+3. If you are reversed using 2 or 4, use f+2+4.
You can also "buffer" a chicken by holding the button down and hitting forward and the
correcponding "sister" button. You'll understand a little lower. Note: A # w/ () around it
means hold the button.
7.1 1~1,1
-If you were ever puting a worm on a hook for bait, this is it. It doesn't get any easier.
Why? Since it is all 1, your chicken is f+1+3. You may have to eat a reversal once to see
the person is reversing it. Most people will reverse the 3rd hit. So do this:
1~1,(1) hit f+3. By holding the 1 you reduce the error involved in pressing f+1+3 by 
"buffering" it. This works 85% of the times, but learn to expect the second to be countered
by good players. Why? Because if they have played against the Changs they will know if you
don't counter the second, there is no guarantee that there will be a third 1 since a 4 can be
substituded in.
7.2 d/b+4,2
-Ahh, I love this one alomst as much as the lowspeep to bowleg buffer. This one is easy since
the first hit can't pe countered, although it can be parried but unlikely.
d/b+4,(2) f+4 This one is cool since if you do connect its not hard to scrap the chicken and
follow with a combo. However, you're not doing this to combo, you're doing this to snap the
guy w/a chicken.
7.3 FC,d/f+4,3
-Now the crowd pleaser, at least thats what you're reversal happy friend will be thinking.
There are very few moves that impress people when counter then this one. Your opponent will
fall for this one like . Its my favorite since there are no real follow ups to the normal,
not ch, FC,d/f+4,3 so you can't lose.
FC,d/f+4,(3) f+1. Tht easy and your opponent will fall for it almost every time. Now some
people will learn and not counter but throw after. If its Paul or Jin you can bet it will 
be the f,f+1+2 throws. Just (2)~1 right after when you see it coming. This is a throw block
buffer. Hit the two to block a 2+4 throw, most people use them, and hold the 2 and hit one
for a buffered 1+2. If you don't fell confident in that just mash 1+2 since if will break
most follow-up throws in this situation. You may have to eat a throw to figure out what
he/she is using, but thats ok.
7.4 HCF+2
-This goes for any Paul players too, always buffer this. Why? Because you can do some nasty
things to people.
HCF+(2) or F+2 or F+4 NOT f+1+2
If they counter hit f+4. Chicken
If they block hit b+4. Reversal
Why do these? Most people will either reverse or counter attack. Either way you're
covered. Be careful, if you counter and your opponent chickens, don't do it again. Not all
people fall for this. Its easy to buffer a counter attack against you. When I use Jin, for
example, and I'm playing against Paul I counter attack the HCF+2 w/B+(4) f+2. This is a real
easy buffer and bait for the tactic above. If this happens, scrap the reversal and just
buffer, but only for a split second. Be ready to block soon afterwards. Note: Do NOT do
this with the f+1+2 since its hard to know which hand is reversed. It changes person to
person.
7.5 WS+4
-Get a person used to you using this every time you stand up and he/she will try to reverse it
every time.
WS+(4) f+2 this works for ALL WS moves.(obviously the WS+(1) or WS+(3) would be F+3/F+1) Real
simple. Try doning this for any character. Jin's WS+2 comes to mind, people love to reverse
that.

7.5 Wrap up
-There are more then this, but these are the easy ones. There are a couple of thing to
remember though.
7.50 These do not work against parries since parries can not be chickened.
7.51 Be careful when fighting Paul or Wang when it comes to the 1~1,1 (or any 1 attack) since
the motion is u/f not f. Also, King's leg reversal CAN NOT be chickened.
7.52 Learn to not have to buffer but to anticipate. The problem w/ buffering is its
distracting and can cause you to lose good juggle opportunities. Just know when your 
opponent will counter and you'll be better off.
7.53 Don't give up trying to learn this. Its hard, I won't lie. The world is full of people
who are talented but give up easily. Thats why hardworkers prevail over talented people.
In a way, being hardworking IS a talent.
