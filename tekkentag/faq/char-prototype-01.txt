**********************************


NATIONALITY - Russian

FIGHTING STYLE - Power moves and mechanical martial arts

AGE - 7

HEIGHT - 135 cm

WEIGHT - 185 kg

BLOOD TYPE - G (Gasoline)

OCCUPATION - None (he is usually left without fuel)

HOBBY - Destruction

LIKES - Imputting data to his memory

DISLIKES - Unknown

 After the first Rave War,the remains of the first prototype Jack unit (a first 
stage model of the final Jack model) was almost destroyed by Jack's rampaging 
combat abilities.Upon reactivation,P Jack complained that his alter-ego had 
received a refit,and repeated his plea til his fuel ran out.Now resting in 
Kazuya's laboratory,P Jack was left for months before a back up fuel supply 
reactivated him,and once again he began his constant pleas for a new look.To 
quieten him,Kazuya gave his captured scientist (Dr Bosconovitch) the task of 
remodelling the robot.With a cunning memory change,the doctor managed to 
convince P Jack that his new body afforded him superior protection to 
Jack's,despite it being only a hat and sunglasses.

 Kazuya is currently goading P Jack into a rage,claiming that the robot isn't 
strong enough to defeat Jack-2.This has lead P Jack to demand more programmed 
manouevers in time for the second tournament.Having repeated his fighting moves 
over an over (to such an extent that the doctor dis-connectedP P Jack's voice 
box),P Jack now feels his next encounter with Jack will have a much different 
conclusion!

**************************
(6) - TTT Juggles & Combos
**************************


All combos are not tech rollable meaning that once the combo has started,it will 
all hit and cannot be tech rolled.Any that ARE tech rollable,I will make a note 
next to it.

Listed after the combo will be the amount of damage the combo/juggle does.Almost 
all of the combos do more damage on a counter hit but some put your opponent 
into a different state if the move hits on a counter.Special cases will always 
be 
mentioned with the combo if necessary.

The juggle starter is included above the combos meaning that you activate the 
commands after the starter.For example,if the juggle starter is "SS+1",the 
follow 
ups to the juggle will be written below the header without including the "SS+1" 
to save repeatedly typing the "SS+1".To sum it up,I'm still a lazy cow ^_^

This is only a starter.I still have combo's to add.Any that aren't here that you 
may have that a guaranteed TRUE combo's,please send them to me at littlpony@jun-
shrine.com

""""""""""
HELL PRESS
""""""""""

I don't know if this is just me,but this move seems to be a little more 
effective in TTT than it was in Tekken 2.This could be down to me only really 
playing PAL Tekken 2.The best time to use this move and have the advantage is 
after an opponent misses a high attack.If you are very close,pop out the hell 
press and choose from many follow-up's such as d/f+1+2,1+2,f+3+4,hcf+1.None of 
those are truly guarenteed but they are possible hit's depending on your 
opponents actions after the Hell Press.Best thing about this move is the fact 
that once activated,it cannot be escaped.Also,you can try this after a 
SS+1.Works even better if you do further side step's as they fall.

"""""""""""
GROUND ZERO
"""""""""""

One of my favourite P Jack throws.It has two different options.You can input the 
hcf+2 to deal a Gigaton Punishment throw.This can however be punch parried by 
Baek (maybe Bryan,Ganny???) or if your opponent times it well,they can press b~B 
to block the punch.Your second option from this throw is to leave the generic 
Gigaton Punch and opt once again for many possible follow-up's.A good one is a 
now staple P Jack move,d/f+1+2.You can also mix up with a f+3+4 which can make a 
player panic even though it does leave you open.

"""""""

A decent throw on it's own,it's real power comes from that lovely tag

"""""""""""""
FATHER'S LOVE
"""""""""""""

This is truly a sight to behold as P Jack practices a little S & M.You piss of 
da Jack,you get your botty smacked.Simple as that.Follow it up with u/f+3+4 = 50 
or f+3+4 = 51.A decent throw.Just keep your guard up as any spectators make 
puddles on the floor.This move has been known to invoke severe incontinence and 
lost voices through hilarity.For a truly comdeic occurance,do this throw on 
Xiaoyu and hear her cry :o)

"""""""""""""""""
REVERSE LIFT SLAM
"""""""""""""""""

Although this throw looks weak compared to Jack 2 and Gunjack's back throws,this 
has some real potential.Try the following follow-ups for some wicked damage.

hcf+1,f+3+4 = 92

u/f+3+4 = 65

""""""""""
BODY SMASH
""""""""""

Yet another of P Jack's useful throws.It's probably his best throw to use as it 
has good follow up's and is difficult to escape (1+2).Sadly,none of the 
following are guarenteed but it can be worthwhile trying for them cause if your 
opponent tries an immediate counter attack,chances are you'll hit them first and 
deal the damage.

f+1+2,d/f+1+2 = 63

d/f+2,2,f+1+2 = 32

f+3+4 = 57

Another lovely bit of cheddar you can try is to continually do the Body Smash 
till you opponent punches you in the nose.Any half decent player will get out of 
this cheese very easily but I mention it cause it exists almost as an infinite 
combo.Use it on the scrubs ;p

++++++++++++++
STANDARD MOVES

"""""""""""
RIGHT PUNCH
"""""""""""

Certainly a move you'll want to use often.ALthough it is a 10 frame affair,it 
still comes out pretty quickly and is therefore effective in poking your 
adversery.However,as withh most moves,over usage can lead to pain which,with P 
Jack,I prefer to be dealing it rather than taking it.A staple part to a healthy 
P Jack juggle!

"""""""""
LEFT KICK
"""""""""

Works nothing like Jack 2's version of the same move and in my opinion is poop 
as it has little to offer even on a counter :(

""""""""""
RIGHT KICK
""""""""""

I don't rate this move much at all bar one usage.Once again,it is the treasured 
counter hit.This juggles on a counter and allows a guarenteed f+3+4,f+1+2 or 1+2 
follow up.That just about wraps this move up really.

"""""""""
SIDE KICK
"""""""""

Another basic move that I use very rarely.Has half decent range but thats about 
it.You don't need this move so let's move on.

""""""""
TOE KICK
""""""""

A little better than it's cousin above but still nothing special.Can work in 
some juggles as a replacement 2 but I'd stick with the jab over this any 
day.Other than an average poke manouvere,I can't think of any other uses.

""""""""""""""
QUICK UPPERCUT
""""""""""""""

A decent uppercut move which is best used while in the crouch position 
(obviously) and can be used in some juggles too.If you want a better 
uppercut,check directly below.

"""""""""""""""
RISING UPPERCUT
"""""""""""""""

Links to the d/f+2 juggles but with added damage on the counter hit.On a regular 
hit it stagger's your opponent allowing a guarenteed f+3+4.All in all,a very 
useful little move for all occasions.

""""""""
MID KICK
""""""""

Does decent damage on a regular hit (28) and works very nicely after a FC D/F... 
juggle for nasty damage.That's about it though.Being a high hit,it can leave you 
very vulnerable if your opponent ducks.Only use it when you're sure or in 
juggles.

"""""""""""""
STANDING KICK
"""""""""""""

Very good WS move.Excellent in your poking game when teamed with d+2.Also works 
lovely in juggles.See above for some nice uses for this move.A necessity if you 
are to play P Jack well.


++++++++++++++++++
SPECIAL TECHNIQUES
++++++++++++++++++

"""""""""""""
MACHINE ELBOW
"""""""""""""

I used to think this was a neat move for poking away and stopping 
attacks.Then,one day,I learnt about frame data and priorities.Needless to say,I 
saw the light.This move is nothing special and nowhere near as good as I once 
thought.Throw it into your juggles for a bit of variety but otherwise I'd steer 
clear as it's way to slow and interruptable to be an effective poke.

"""""""""""""
P JACK HAMMER
"""""""""""""

Another move my opinion is divided on.If all 3 hits connect you're looking at 51 
damage (59 CH).I can usually catch with this one pretty well.All in all 
though,it feels a little out-dated in TTT for me.Slow and very easy to be 
stopped.Doesn't sound too good.Nice for a change but use it with caution.

"""""""""""""""""
PUNCH,ELBOW,UPPER
"""""""""""""""""

I love this move too.Use the first 2 hits often to chip away at your opponent.My 
favourite thing about this is to use this after my partner's juggle starter,tag 
out on the upper and ride in with a tag slide for decent damage all round.Looks 
real cool too.Hell you gotta love this guy's shades too :o)

"""""""""""""""""""""""
TILE SPLITTER,DEATHFIST
"""""""""""""""""""""""

***CAUTION***

Using this move against the Chang's and you're toast.P Jack can be attacked 
between the 1 and 2 leading into an immediate counter hit.With the Chang's,this 
is totally unacceptable.Even more than scantily clad women (sorry,but "The Right 
To Censor" from the WWF make me laugh)!Any character with a quick frame jab or 
kick will knock you out of this,again counting as a counter hit.Also,it is 
possible to side step the deathfist leaving you wide open to a side throw or a 
side juggle (on a Jack,this means trouble).One good thing with this move (yes 
there is one),is the ability to delay the deathfist which can be used 
effectively if not abused.This move is so Tekken 2 though it hurts ^_^

"""""""""""
CEMAHO CHOP
"""""""""""

This move confirm's P Jack as martial artist extraordinaire along with this Dark 
Cutter.Okay,maybe not but it looks like P Jack has been watching Chuck Norris 
movies too long.This is another move I'm uncertain of how to class.It can be 
useful and really makes you wince when it hits.However,I'll emphasise that last 
word "WHEN".The chop is painfully slow in coming out.If you do hit with it 
though,it can really help turn a match round.A f+1+2,d/f+1+2 works quite often 
after the chop but your best bet would be d/f+2 and your fav juggle.I don't 
think the upper is a guarentee but I'd love to be proved wrong.You can also tag 
this after any class 1 juggle which looks pretty smart,is a certain hit and does 
fair damage for no effort.Certainly a move best done from a distance.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
MACHINE GUN PUNCH,MEGATON PUNCH
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This move works best in a juggle from P Jack's hcf+1 or SS+1 for nice damage and 
some flash.The other use for this move is to lift your opponent from the 
ground.Great for those that like to roll backwards and tech roll.Best bet is to 
stick with the juggle ender tho I think.

"""""""""""""
UPPERCUT RUSH
"""""""""""""

Catch this on a counter and say sex!There are loads of juggles off of this 
baby.Be mindfull of using it as a poke technique.Specially on Wang cos the old 
fart will reverse your ass and you can't give him the poultry.However,on a CH 
this is THE move to use to win with P Jack.It's also sufficiently different for 
me to list it's little brother below.

""""""""""""""""""""
HAMMER UPPERCUT RUSH
""""""""""""""""""""

Altough it looks identical to the uppercut rush,it is quite different.Juggle 
damage differs between the two.Also,you cannot get a U/F+4 after the last upper 
with the hammer rush.This move seems to do an extra point or 2 of damage in 
juggles but isn't as versatile as the above string.

""""""""
WINDMILL
""""""""

Holy smoke,this move has won me some matches.If you connect the first 3 
hits,your opponent ends up on the floor allowing these follow up's.

u/f+3+4

d/f+1+2

f+3+4 

The other interesting thing with this move is that if your opponent blocks the 
string and get's hit with the backhand,they will be open to a guarenteed f+1+2 
or f+3+4.Easily ducked or reversed though.If your opponent gets hit by the 
backhand,they are up shit creek without a paddle.It gives a back turn which you 
can follow up to near full energy damage if your opponent "plays the game" and 
does what you want em to :p

""""""""""""
RUSH STRINGS
""""""""""""

I'm gonna be lazy and not explain all the possibilities else I'll be here all 
week.Basically learn each avenue and mix em around so you don't get 
predictable.However,I very rarely use any of these other than in juggles.A P 
Jack game dominated with rush strings is gonna cause instant insomnia.

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
HAMMER KNUCKLE,DOUBLE UPPERCUT
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A nice little move this one.Best to use this when you see your opponent miss a 
move or just as they tag in if they are unprepared.I also get a decent hit 
average when I delay the double uppercut.Again,use it sparingly and you'll work 
well with it.

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
DOUBLE UPPERCUT,HAMMER KNUCKLE
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Works similarly to above but I think this is slightly more restrictive seeing as 
you have to be in a crouching position to get it out (no,not that).Also,the 
double uppercut is pretty poor as a stand alone juggle starter.Stick to your 
d+2's and WS+4's from the crouch position along with the windmill and upper 
rushes on CH.

""""""""""""
ARM SCISSORS
""""""""""""

I defy you to win a match with P Jack without using this move.Very good in all 
sorts of ways.Works well in juggles.Works great as a stand alone with a certain 
d/f+1+2 always sure to hit.I thank Namco for making this move more versatile to 
use (remember in Tekken 2 it used to f,f+1+2 reducing it's effectiveness 
IMHO).This is also a guarentee after the backhand from the windmill if it is 
blocked.Put simply,you need this move!

""""""""""""
GROUND DRILL
""""""""""""

This might sound silly but this move is the main reason I picked up P Jack.For 
some reason it is so damn satisfying to hit with.It only takes little things to 
pleasure me (I'll resist the blatantly obvious penis joke).Use this move 
often.If you can catch both hits on their own,immediately follow up with another 
d/f+1+2 for a whopping 61 damage.Then mix up a f+3+4 or u/f+3+4 to add even more 
to the damage.Ground Drill is the way forward to your P Jack game.Get drilling 
baby yeah!

"""""""""""
DRILL UPPER
"""""""""""

Again,I'll resist the obvious joke about drill's and willies and cut straight to 
the point.This move is slow to come out,but in my opinion is THE best class 1 
launcher in the game (or a close second to Baek's f,N,d,d/f+3).Best of all,this 
move is not tech rollable at all meaning if you like you can just sit back and 
watch your victim plummet to the ground.But you don't want to do that,you want 
to hurt em some more.As a quick peek at the juggle list above will show you,P 
Jack has some lovely follow ups of his own to this move.Team him with some of 
the other characters though to see some truly sick juggles.Here's some of my 
favs.

""""""""""""""
TORNADO CUTTER
""""""""""""""

Another useful SS move for our P Jack.Can immediately be followed up when it 
hits with the staple d/f+1+2 for a hefty 53 damage.It isn't the fastest of moves 
but it is a useful mix up for your side step game (although P Jack doesn't side 
step quickly at all).Also finishes a simple class 1 juggle.A bit boring though 
sadly.The one thing I have learned with this move is that it can place P Jack in 
an assortment of different positions either in front of or behind your 
opponent.Experiment in practice mode from varying angles to learn the differing 
axis' P Jack can get onto.

"""""""""""
DRILL PUNCH
"""""""""""

Catch this baby on a counter and you will see a damn fine and damn cruel 
move.This appears to be P Jack's way of telling you to erm "go away".Works quite 
well if you see an opening but again,due to P Jack's rather slow side step you 
might want to stick to using this in juggles only.It will either do the counter 
throw animation or it can lead a lovely juggle if hit right.If the punch knocks 
the opponent away instead of throwing,you can follow up with f+3+4 for 77 
damage.Sure to end a match quickly!

"""""""""""""
SPRING HAMMER
"""""""""""""

This move reeks so much of Tekken 1,I hate it.Please,don't even bother using it 
cause even if it hit's your opponent it leaves you vulnerable.Avoid!!!!

"""""""""
HIP PRESS
"""""""""

Very useful little manouvere this is.Works nicely as an alternative to d/f+1+2 
and is an almost certain hit after a spank side throw.Works fairly well in 
juggles too.This is definetly best when used on a floored opponent for some 
cruel damage and a re-shaped spine for no extra cost!

"""""""""""""""
SITTING PUNCHES
"""""""""""""""

This one is a mediocre move.Can work very well to catch your opponent by 
surprise.Also you will get all 4 hits if the first hits on a counter.You have to 
be careful using this though cos if you screw it up you're a sitting duck.Almost 
literally!The punches also work if you do the hip press and it misses your 
opponent.You can't do the punches if it hits but you can if they block the 
hit.Also,watch the low parries on this one.Specially on King cos you'll eat a 
parry then crouch throw.

""""""""""""""""""""""
EXPLODER/MEGATON UPPER
""""""""""""""""""""""

This is THE trademark P Jack move.The only other character to have this move is 
Gunjack but I find his slower and weaker.A very good alternative to the 
SS+1.Also a class 1 launcher,the opportunites for follow up's are vast as pretty 
much anything will hit after it.Also very good for sneaking under punches and 
high attacks.Be resourceful though cos if you miss you're open to big 
damage.Another move to only really use from a distance.

"""""""""""""
MEGATON PUNCH
"""""""""""""

Damn this move hurts.I have a real good hit average with this too.If you can hit 
a back turned opponent with this,the match is pretty much yours as again,it has 
a lot of follow ups.If you catch this on a counter hit your oppponent will eat a 
lot of damage (77 on a clean hit).Also works lovely after a class 1 starter for 
an easy chunk of damage.A little slow like many of P Jack's moves but anguish if 
it hits.

"""""""""""""
GIGATON PUNCH
"""""""""""""

On it's own,nothing more than a baby megaton punch.However,this move has one 
property that makes it worthwhile.If your opponent blocks the punch after a wind 
up,it staggers them and guarentee's you a throw.Just time the throw after they 
stagger else you'll grab right through and miss the throw.Apart from the throw 
guarentee,this move has little else to offer.If you're playing as Jack 2 on the 
other hand....

""""""""
CLOCK UP
""""""""

P Jack doing his finest Ogre impression.I love this move.Works to repel any 
attacks.You can cancel the beauty out and do a crazy walk with repeat 
cancels.You can even use it in juggles for no extra damage but just to show you 
can.If you really want to go for the flash,try using the clock up cancel in a 
juggle too.Works nicely into d/f+1+2.

"""""""""""""
GIGATON STOMP
"""""""""""""

P Jack's first unblockable.Certainly not the best move in the game but far from 
the worst either.You can hit this unblockable twice for a nice 67 damage.Very 
much like P Jack doing an impersonation of Chun Li from Streetfighter.Shame he 
ain't got the leg's to pull it off :)
 Only realy advised for a bit of fun and a surprise tactic.You'd be surprised 
how many people get hit with this move if they're off guard.Exploit this factor!

""""""""""""""""""""""""
WIND UP TO GIGATON PUNCH
""""""""""""""""""""""""

How does 199 damage sound?Yep,enough to wipe out both partners then some.Bad 
news,if you manage to hit the final hit for the mega damage,I'll give you a 
medal.I'm sorry but this move just won't hit anyone.Even the scrubs would laugh 
at someone who eat's the 199 damage.I've only ever caught the 60 damage one a 
couple of times.

""""""""""""""
GIGA TAG STOMP
""""""""""""""

Bloody hell Namco,P Jack ain't the Incredible Hulk.What's with all this giga 
stuff.Oh hang on,thats Gamma isn't it.My apologies.This is a nice little 
surprise variant on the gigaton stomp.Instead of tagging in normally,try this as 
an alternative.It hit's often if used sparingly.Specially good for those that 
like to rush at you as you tag in and end up wearing P Jack's boot in their 
head.Also,tag this onto a d,d/b+4 with Lee for a nice 54 damage juggle that is 
guarenteed.

"""""""""""""
DARK GREETING
"""""""""""""

Some people may think I should class this move along with the wind up to gigaton 
for unlikliness to hit.However,EVERY person that's said to me "You'll never 
catch me with that" has been caught by it at least once.I certainly wouldn't 
count this as a recommendation but it can hit and can be followed up with the 
following stuff:-

d/f+1+2 = 120

hcf+1 = 123

d/b+1,FC D+1 = 120

1+2 = 117

f+3+4 = 121

And for flash,try these out.The b+1+2 lifts the opponent off the floor.

b+1+2,f+3+4 = 121

b+1+2,d/f+1+2 = 120

b+1+2,1+2 = 117

And for an extra dosage of flash,cancel the clock up

b+1+2~f,d/f+1+2 = 121

b+1+2~f,f+3+4 = 121
