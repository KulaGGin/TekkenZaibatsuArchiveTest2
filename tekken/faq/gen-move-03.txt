STORY:
------

 Towards the end of the 20th century, a mysterious challenge went out to
all who were deserving.  No one knows from where it originated, but its
draw was irresistible.  The promise of power and riches beyond those
attainable by the common man all to go to the survivor. From the depths
of the lower earth to the far reaches of the outlands the call escaped
no one. Many perished during the mortal street fights that were only a
preview of the challenges that were to come. Only 8 remain, those with
the true killer instinct, all ready to die, to gain the title of "TEKKEN",
"Lord of the Rave War."

		Forward Roll, Arm Swing: F + LP + RP
		(can be followed with sitting punches, except for Ganryu)
		Arm Swing: LP + RP

 Ground Attacks:

	(use any combo of UB/U/UF with RP for placement of pounce,
	 any variation of a pounce for a special character will be noted
	 in the moves section)

	Low Pounce: U + RP (anytime)
	High Pounce: U + RP (hold both for duration of move)

 10-Attack Strings:

	The 10-Attack Strings are a series of punch/kick attacks characters
	can execute. If successfully executed, these attacks can do a
	considerable amount of damage on your opponent. However, they can
	be escaped, blocked, or counter-attacked (i.e.while your in a 10-
	hitter, your opponent might be able to perform a throw move on you)
	Variations can be performed on the attack strings, yet you must
	follow the notated moves in this faq to achieve the full 10 hits.
	These attacks are impressive to witness and hard to block if part
	of the string connects as moves very from high to low attacks.

 Unblockable Attacks:

	These attacks generally take a while to execute, which allows your
	opponent to knock you out of it's execution. If they do connect,
	these attacks cannot be blocked and do considerable damage. The
	amount of damage is variable when your playing in the 2-player mode
	where handicaps can be adjusted.

 Hard Pounces: 

	Normally to execute a pounce attack, you just hit U + RP when your
	opponent is on the ground. This causes you to automatically jump
	into the air and land on your opponent with a pounce attack that is
	usually different from your character's regular ground punch while
	jumping. When normal pounces tend to "home in" on the opponent to
	some extent, heavy pounces have a set range, which is rather short,
	so you must aim correctly if you want to hit the them. Also, hard
	pounces can be done any time, even if they're not on the ground.
	If you do a hard pounce while your opponent is just standing there,
	expect to get hit. Hard pounces are also slower than normal pounces,
	so your opponent has more time to recover before you hit, and there
	is a greater lag time for you after doing a heavy pounce, giving
	your opponent more time to retaliate.

 Throws:

	As most games, all throws must be performed at a very close range.
	Many people have accused Tekken of being cheap because so many throw
	type moves are included in the game. I feel that this makes for much
	more strategic game play and although every player has two basic
	throw moves (LP/LK, RP/RK), the more elaberate throws are harder to
	pull off in the heat of battle against good players. It's very easy
	to see if someone's trying to pull a throw on you, most characters 	will be attempting to 'grab' at the air. It's very easy to hit or
	counter- throw them at this point when their unsuccessful grab is
	relaxing and pulling back to their body. Executing a throw move
	while your opponent is performing a jumping attack will cause them
	to be "bounced" back onto the ground unhurt, with their jumping
	attack and your throw attack unsuccessful (damage-wise).

GAME FEATURES:
--------------

 Galaga:

     Players are welcomed with a game of Galaga while the CD is loading
     (as Namco did with Galaxian in Ridge Racer). You will be presented
     with a Challenge Stage in which you must shoot 40 enemies before
     advancing to the next Bonus Stage, there are 8 total. The X button
     is your normal fire button while the top (triangle) button functions
     as an 'autofire'. If you miss shooting all 40, you may repeat the
     stage by pressing Select. If you press select at the end of the 8th
     stage, you will be returned to the 1st stage again. Once you complete
     all 8 Challenge Stages the game will begin loading, if you have a 
     memory card in your PSX at this stage, it will automatically load
     your saved game at this point. Note: You will gain access to Devil 
     Kazuya if you defeat Galaga with a minimum of one continue. This is 
     best done if you clear the opening stage in 18.5 seconds or under, 
     which will grant you another ship (double shooter). You still need
     to  keep a pattern down for the next levels to be successful, and if
     you do continue once at any point, you retain the second ship.

     Additional: To automatically start with dual ships in Galaga just
     press and hold the up(d-pad), L1, triangle, and cross buttons while
     the PSX is powering up on the player 2 controller. You will then
     begin Galaga with the dual ships.

 CG Cinemas:

     There are two basic FMV intros to the game, one introducing all the
     characters in their native environment (Michelle running through the
     desert, Paul riding a motorbike, King in a chapel, etc.), the other
     being an action profile on Kazuya. Only the 8 normal characters
     feature ending CG sequences once they defeat Heihachi Mishima.
     (note: these will be added in the next version)

 Using Bosses:

     All bosses can be accessed once defeated, this is done quickly and
     easily by turning the difficulty setting in the Options screen to
     "Easy". Each character has his/her own mid-level boss with Heihachi
     Mishima being the last. You will gain access to them once you defeat
     the mid-level boss and Heihachi, weither you use continues doesn't
     matter. The bosses will then be accessible to either the left of
     Yoshimitsu or the right of Michelle in the Arcade mode. In the two
     player mode, it will be displayed as a long list of names. To access
     Heihachi, you must defeat him and all the characters before him
     without using continues, you may use any character in doing so. The
     opponents for Heihachi are all the mid level bosses, with his Boss
     being Devil Kazuya. To access Devil Kazuya, you must defeat Galaga
     (see above) and while only in 'Arcade' mode, position your selection
     on 'Kazuya' and press 'Start' instead of a punch/kick. The following
     are the Boss assignments:

        PLAYER                  MID BOSS                FINAL BOSS
        ------                  --------                ----------

        Heihachi Mishima                                Devil Kazuya

 View Options:
     
     There are 3 different views to choose from during play. As soon as
     [Select View] appears, pressing 'Select' will change views from a
     Side View to a 3/4 view, and then to an extreme overhead 3/4 view if
     pressed again.

 Optional Listed Names Feature in Arcade Mode:

     If for some reason you prefer to look at a list of names to choose
     from in the Arcade mode instead of the portraits of each character,
     you can do so by pressing both L1 and R1 on top of the controller
     simutaneously before and while your selecting "Arcade" from the title
     screen.

==========================================================================

2-PLAYER MODE NOTES:
--------------------

     Devil Kazuya cannot be selected in this mode, only in 'Arcade' mode.

     The Handicap meter that appears when you select a character can be
     adjusted by moving your joypad left/right. Decreasing the stars to
     the left will make your attacks more damaging, while increasing the
     stars to the right will do the opposite, making your attacks less
     damaging.

     To exit the 2-Player mode (also Arcade mode or during any match),
     just simutaneously press 'Start' and 'Select'. This will bring you
     to the title screen.

==========================================================================

OPTIONS MODE SCREEN: (->TitleScreen/TestMode/OptionsMode/)

	Determines the number of rounds you must win to defeat your opponent.
	Settings allow you to choose any round from 1 to 5.

	Note: With the fight count set to "1", this is considered the
	"time-attack" mode for the game to try and beat all the bosses in
	shortest amount of time. My personal best being 1'21"43 using Ganryu.

 Round Time:

	The amount of time a round lasts. Selections are from 20, 30, 40,
	50, or 60 seconds and Infinite.

 BSM Select:

	Allows you to choose from the 'Original' arcade music (yuck) to the
	great PSX 'Arrange' selections. Also featured is a 'Silent' mode

	Your choice of Numbers (boring) or Fruit (ala PacMan).

 Character Change At Continue:

	When turned to 'Yes' this allows you to change characters when you
	lose in 'Arcade' mode. Otherwise 'No' will only allow you to choose
	the character you started with in 'Arcade' mode.

 Key Configuration:

	This allows you to modify the assignment of your controller buttons.
	Preset 1: Square = LP / Triangle = RP / X = LK / Circle = RK
	Preset 2: L1 = LP / R1 = RP / L2 = LK / R2 = RK
	Preset 3: Square = LP / Triangle = RP / X = LK / Circle = RK
	          L1 = LP = LK  / R1 = RP + RK
	          L2 = LK + RK / R2 = LP + RP

Since Tekken is about to be released in the US, there will likely be new discoveries on combos and such... if you have something to contribute, please do so by listing moves using the same technique as presented in this FAQ. I also realize that there are several Tekken strategy guides in Japan, if you have access to these that features moves not found in this FAQ, or correct move names, please email me.

GRATUITOUS BITCHING
-------------------

check out the latest Game Players for a rip-off variation of my FAQ as well as other zines that are now featuring Tekken guides (wow, it's only been available on the PSX for over half a year just as long as my FAQ's been out), but why pay for it when you can get it for free? hell, here's my plug not buy any of the outdated trash you'll find on the shelves... there's always enough time to flip at the newsstand, long live the net. ^_^
