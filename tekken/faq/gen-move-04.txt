Moves for all characters:

 Rolling attack while getting up: F + LP + RP, F + LP + RP (while on ground)
 Attack enemy on ground: U + RP (while enemy is on ground)
 Slide Kick - RK (while running)

Note: Certain moves whether blocked or not will stun your opponent, this is a 
100% grade A "cheese" move and  can be followed up by either a throw or combo. 
WARNING- I  recommend you don't do these moves often, they really piss off 
your opponent.
