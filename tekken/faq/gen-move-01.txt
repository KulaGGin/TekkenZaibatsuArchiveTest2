Tekken FAQ 2.2

====================================================================

Well, it's not fancy, but it'll do in a pinch. I hope to add to this in
the future. Enjoy.

=====================================================================


Story:
------

 Towards the end of the 20th century, a mysterious challenge went out to
all who were deserving.  No one knows from where it originated, but its draw
was irresistible.  The promise of power and riches beyond those attainable by
the common man all to go to the survivor.  From the depths of the lower earth 
to the far reaches of the outlands the call escaped no one. Many perished 
during the mortal street fights that were only a preview of the challenges 
that were to come. Only 8 remain, those with the true killer instinct, all 
ready to die, to gain the title of "TEKKEN", "Lord of the Rave War."

==========================================================================
 
 Abbreviations:
 --------------

  F = Forward           LP = Left Punch
  D = Down              RP = Right Punch
  B = Back              LK = Left Kick
  U = Up                RK = RIght Kick
  HCB = Half-circle Back
  HCF = Half-circle Forward

==========================================================================

 Notes:
 ------

 Some moves that have LP + RP listed do not NEED to have both punches
pressed, but it works just fine that way, and also, some moves can be
done by pressing both buttons. The CPU decides which attack to throw out.
This is very overused with King and Jack, where you keep smacking the
punches and getting combos.

 For some moves that require you to tap or hold DF or DB, the placement of
the controller must be exact, so some moves might seem not to work all the
time, but it just takes a little practice.

Some moves, mostly the Jump Kicks, can only be done from a little bit away
from the enemy. They won't work if you're standing right up close.

 If a move has (hold) next to it, it simply means that you must hold
the controller in that position for about 1 seconds.

 If it says to "tap" a certain motion, it means you must gently tap the
controller in that direction. Holding the controller in the specified
direction will not produce the desired effect.

==========================================================================
 
 Stuns:
 ------

 If something has (stuns) next to it, it means that the move will
stun the enemy if blocked, and leave them open for an attack. Cheap, but
it's there.

==========================================================================
 
 Hard Pounces:
 -------------

 Normally to execute a pounce attack, you just hit U + RP when the opponent
is on the ground. This causes you to automatically jump into the air and
land on the enemy with a pounce attack that is usually different from your
character's regular ground punch while jumping. However, when you hit the
enemy with a pounce, they seem to magically fly a few feet away after being 
"hit". However, hard pounces actually land on the enemy, and do more damage 
than normal pounces, but also have a few drawbacks. When normal pounces tend 
to "home in" on the enemy to some extent, heavy pounces have a set range, 
which is rather short, so you must aim correctly if you want to hit the enemy.
Also, hard pounces can be done any time, even if the enemy is not on the 
ground. If you do a hard pounce while the enemy is just standing there, expect
to get hit. Hard pounces are also slower than normal pounces, so the enemy has
more time to recover before you hit, and there is a greater lag time for you 
after doing a heavy pounce, giving the enemy more time to retaliate.


 Law:        ?
 ----

 Michelle:   Hopback Stomp - UF + LK + RP
 ---------

 King:       Elbow Drop - UF (or U) + RP + RK
 -----       Knee Drop - UF + LK + RK

 Yoshimitsu: Hopback Stomp - UF + LK + RK
 -----------

 Jack:       Butt Drop - UF + LK + RK (if this misses, causes Jack to sit)
 -----

 Kazuya:     Hopback Punch - UF + RP + RK
 -------

 Nina:       ?
 -----

 Paul:       ?
 -----

==========================================================================
 
 Unblockable Attacks:
 --------------------

 Like the name implies, these attacks cannot be blocked. Since they take so
long to actually attack, it's easy to knock someone out of one. However, if
the attack does hit, most unblockable attacks do at least 50% damage, with
the exception of Yoshimitsu's Sword Chop. Without further ado, here is each 
character's unblockable attack:


 Paul:       ?
 -----

 Kazuya:     ?
 -------

 Jack:       Windup Punch - B, DB, D, DF, rotate controller counterclockwise
 -----                      until Jack reaches the count of 5, then LP
                            (if count isn't at 5, punch can be blocked)
                            (at 5, this is an instant 1-hit kill)

 Law:        Dashing Punch - Tap DB + LP + RP (tap U, U to abort attack)
 ----

 Nina:       Crane Chop - Tap DB + LP + RP (tap U, U to abort attack)
 -----

 Yoshimitsu: Sword Chop - Tap DB + LP (quick, but does little damage)
 ----------- Sword Stab - Tap B, B + LP
        
 King:       ?
 -----

 Michelle:   Running Uppercut - Tap B, B, B (hold 3rd B, this makes her
 ---------                                   stand on one leg)
                                Tap LP to run and punch (while standing on 1
                                                         leg)

==========================================================================
 
 10-Attack Strings:
 ------------------

 Some people think these are combos, but they are not. These are just
strings of 10 attacks that do lots of damage if they all hit, but are not
combos per se. In other words, if one hit of the string hits, it does not
mean that the rest will. The enemy still has a chance to get away, block, or
counterattack. The good thing about the strings is that the attacks change
from high to low throughout, which can be difficult to block. Although there
are variations and changes that can be done to the strings, the only way to
get the full 10 attacks is to do it exactly as listed below. Besides doing
good damage, some of these are just plain impressive.

 Yoshimitsu: LP, RP, LP, RK, RK, RK, LP, LP, LP, LP
 -----------

==========================================================================

Character Stories:
------------------

 Kazuya Mishima: Japanese - Karate Fighter
 ---------------

        Kazuya is a scuffle Karate Fighter with an even temperament and a
 cool head. He's the legitimate heir to the Mishima financial empire, he was
 banished by his father for a crime he did not commit. In their final battle,
 he was left to  die by his father and he still bears the scar on his chest as
 a contsant reminder. He wishes to use the tournament winnings to finance the
 overthrow of his father's forces.


 Paul Phoenix: American - Judo Expert
 -------------

        Driven to be the best of the best, Paul travels the world in search of
 the perfect opponent. He is a judo expert but he is skilled in many forms of
 the Martial Arts. There is only one fighter in this tournament who is ranked
 on an equal level to Paul. His goal is to eliminate any comparisons.


 King: Mexican - Wrestler
 -----

        King was once a ruthless killer. Orphaned at birth, he was a street
 child who only knew a life of crime. Found half dead by a Marquez Priest, he
 was nursed back to health and joined the order. His dream of building an
 orphanage can be realized by winning the Tournament.


 Nina Williams: British - Bone Martial Arts & Aikido
 --------------

        Nina acquired her unusual combination of skills from her parents.  Her
 father, once an assassin for the IRA left Ireland to escape his past.  His
 marriage to a British Aikido champion created a bloodline that would spawn a
 child with incredible talent and a killer instinct. Nina was kidnapped by an
 underground force and drugged into believing that that the Rave War sponsor
 must be assassinated. God help anyone who gets in her way.


 Jack: Russian - Power fighter
 -----

        Jack is an android. A killing machine who only knows one thing,
  "Don't stop until all your enemies are gone."  Made by the Soviets prior
  to the great disarmament. He was thought to be destroyed in the early 90's
  along with the nuclear warheads. Protected by a madman whose goal is to
  turn Russia back into a Communist power, Jack can be very difficult to
  stop. If he wins, international sparks will fly.

==========================================================================

Miscellaneous:
--------------

 "Fruit": Just to clear up one thing some people are confused with. Tekken
has two different violence settings for some reason. One setting produces
red sparks when an enemy is hit, and keeps track of wins by the word "Wins"
with the number of wins next to it on the bottom of the screen. The other
setting produces green sparks when a hit connects, and wins are kept track
of by various pieces of fruit and other symbols. Not all Tekkens have this
stupid fruit thing.

 Alternate Colors: To choose the normal colors for your character, select
your character using either punch. To get the alternate colors, select
your character using either kick. According to Galen Komatsu, there is also
a 3rd color scheme, for Kazuya at least, but it is unknown how to access it.

 Round Extensions: I was playing on a Tekken with symbols instead of wins,
so I am not totally sure what number win I was on when this happened.
Usually, the symbols come in pairs, so I thought nothing of it when a symbol
that was a yellow flag with an "S" next to it appeared where the wins appear. 
However, the match that that symbol first appeared during was set for the best 
3 of 5, instead of the usual 2 of 3 wins. After winning, there was not another 
flag symbol, there were pairs from then on, and the matches
were back to the best 2 of 3 wins. Weird.

 Pac-Man: If you play on a Tekken with symbols instead of wins, if you get
40 wins or more, as far as I know, all symbols from that point are just
yellow Pac-Men, but then again, I've only seen up to 44 wins, but since the
symbols usually come in pairs, and there were 4 Pac-Men, it seems logical.

 "Endings": Unfortunately, Tekken has no endings after beating Heihachi.
All you get is a series of replays showing your 2nd defeat of each CPU
opponents, then the credits screen. I've seen 3 different backdrops for
the credits screen, but I don't know if they're random or if you see
a certain one for doing something special. The first is an orange skyline
behind orange mountains. The second is the same orange tint, but with
a picture of clouds instead of mountains. The third is a scrolling blue
scene with bluish-white clouds, finally stopping on a large cloud with
a ray of white light coming from it. I've only seen the blue one once.
Nothing special, considering no one watches the credits anyway.
