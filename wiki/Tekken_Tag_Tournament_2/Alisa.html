</p><p><b>Background:</b> Deep in the forest, there is a heavily guarded research facility. Taking the name of the research leader, the facility is called the Bosconovich Laboratory. The facility was highly valued by the Mishima Zaibatsu, as it undertook all of the military equipment development for the organization. The lowermost level of the facility houses a top secret section. In one of its rooms, there slept a young girl in a clear capsule. Her name was Alisa Bosconovich. Everything else about her is a mystery...

<b>Writeup By <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external text" href="../../forums/showthread3f7c.html?threadid=125520">Demoyon</a></b>
</p><p>Alisa is a very evasive character, using her great movement and range to keep opponents out of reach at all times. Her poking and keepout game is where her strength lies, thus this needs to be exploited as much as possible. However, Alisa has problems breaking down turtles, which leads to opponents easily and effectively countering her overall gameplay by simply turtling her out and rendering her keep-out useless. She also lacks quick, tag bufferable launchers, which is essential in this game. This led to her being placed low in tier lists worldwide.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Standing_Punishment"> Standing Punishment </span></h3>
<p>-10f: 1,1
</p><p>Standard jab string punish. Alisa's 1,1 does 29 damage and leads to +4 frames, enough to make some mids uninterruptible. This leads to opponents staying still, which allows you to apply mixups.
</p><p>-12f: df+4
</p><p>Long range 12f mid which does 15 damage and leads to +4 frames. Only use this to punish long pushback moves such as generic getup 4 and Jin's ff+2. Otherwise, use her 1,1 as it leads to more damage with the same amount of positive frames.
</p><p>-13f: 4
</p><p>Simple and effective; this does 28 damage and knocks the opponent down for decent oki. Also gives wallsplat if your opponent has his/her back to the wall.
</p><p>-14f: f+1+2
</p><p>Another long range punisher which does 26 damage and leads to +7 frames. +7 is big as it makes your df+2 uninterruptible.
</p><p>-14f: f+3,2
</p><p>Yet again another long range punisher, this does 32 damage and leads to +11 frames; however, you are left in DES form after this move. Use this when you want to apply DES mixups.
</p><p>-15f: uf+4,4
</p><p>Alisa's hopkick, even though it's bad, is still a launcher. Use it.
</p><p>-16f: df+2
</p><p>Alisa's staple launcher. Whenever you can punish your opponent with this move, do so. You'll be glad you did.
</p><p>-17f: bf+2
</p><p>Her longest range punisher, this does 31 damage and knocks the opponent down. They can quickly backroll out of this to recover safely. This move also splats them to the wall if it is directly behind them. Use this to punish heavy moves such as the last hit of Paul's Demolition Man (d+4:2:1+2).
</p><p>-18f: ff+1+2
</p><p>A long range launcher. You will rarely use this for block punishment as both df+2 and b+3+4 are better.
</p><p>-19f: b+3+4
</p><p>You will also rarely use this for block punishment, but in those rare cases, this move is great. You can tag buffer out of it to allow your partner to deal red life juggle damage, or you can continue the full move (b+3+4,3+4) and get a damaging launcher into bound.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Crouching_Punishment"> Crouching Punishment </span></h3>
<p>-10f: FC 1
</p><p>Crouch jab. Because something is better than nothing, right? Use this to punish moves which leave you crouching and them at -10, namely Bryan's ff+4 and Lei's ff+2.
</p><p>-11f: ws+4
</p><p>Standard ws+4. Does 18 damage and leaves you at +6 frames. You will be using this move a lot.
</p><p>-14f: ws+1,2
</p><p>A mid,high string which does 24 damage and leaves you at +6 frames. Be careful in using this as the 2 is easily duckable and you will get launched if you fail to punish correctly.
</p><p>-15f: uf+4,4
</p><p>There are some launch punishable lows which cannot be punished by ws+2, the most common case being Miguel's db+1. Use this instead. Even though it's a bad hopkick, it's still a hopkick.
</p><p>-17f: ws+2
</p><p>Alisa's ws launcher. Does 28 damage and can be tag buffered to allow your partner to deal red life juggle damage. You can also go into FLY after this by continuing it (ws+2,3+4) and doing the standard ws+2 juggle.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Homing_and_Tracking_Moves"> Homing and Tracking Moves </span></h3>
<p>In a game where movement is key to setting up launchers, tracking moves are essential in keeping your opponents in place.
</p><p>Homing:
f+4,1,4
b+3
ws+1+2
d+3+4
DES 1+2
</p><p>Tracking:
b+1 - both sides
f+2 - to Alisa's right
df+1 - to Alisa's right
df+3 - to Alisa's left 
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Walls"> Walls </span></h3>
<p>With the introduction of walls in Tekken 4, certain moves can splat your opponent to the wall, allowing guaranteed follow-ups which deal high damage. Walls are a very important part of the game, locking down movement and allowing deadly 50/50's.
</p><p>Use these moves often when your opponent is near a wall to maximize your mixups.
</p><p>Note: I will only put useful wall splat moves here. Alisa has a lot of wall splat moves, but most of them are useless and will rarely work the way you intended them to.
</p><p>Opponent's back to the wall
</p>
<ul><li> 4: 13f high, safe, guaranteed after (db+2),2
</li><li> (db+1),1: safe, evasive high which crushes highs and some mids
</li><li> d+2,4: good mixup with db+4, it is -13 on block so be careful
</li><li> b+2&gt;4: m,h, hit-confirm the 4 for safety as it can be ducked and punished
</li><li> iWR+2: high, +4 on block, useful to setup other wallsplat moves
</li><li> iWR+3,4: m,m, safe, good if they duck anticipating iWR+2
</li><li> (2,3),3: NCc, good if they attack with their back to the wall, only -11 on block
</li><li> uf+3&gt;2: hit-confirmable wall splat; if uf+3 is blocked, follow-up with FLY b to evade attacks and punish whiffs with backup 1 into a wallsplat. If they don't try to attack you out of it, mixup FC df+1+2 or ws+1+2.
</li></ul>
<p>Opponent's left side to the wall

<p><br />
<b><big>50/50's at the wall</big></b>
</p><p>When your opponent is near a wall, his/her movement is restricted to specific directions due to the wall. For example, he/she cannot backdash when his/her back is to the wall. You can take advantage of this by applying deadly 50/50's which cannot be avoided unless blocked.
</p><p>db+4 and d+2,4<br />
</p><p>This is a good 50/50 to use as the animation frames are kinda similar in the initial frames. Upon hitting db+4, cc d+2,4 is guaranteed. Upon hitting d+2,4, it splats them to the wall giving a wall juggle.
</p><p>FC df+1+2 and ws+1+2<br />
</p><p>Another good 50/50 even in wall situations. Use the +5 from FC df+1+2 to create FC mixups or even use her uf+1+2 grab which gives good wall oki. Hitting ws+1+2 gives a guaranteed cc db+3, but you can do cc db+4 from time to time as the opponent will be afraid to duck at the wall in fear of getting splat.
</p><p>DES f+1+2, DES 1, DES 1+2, and DES d+1<br />
</p><p>Destroy form is great at the wall because the opponent's movement will be restricted, preventing them from moving to avoid the mixup. Use DES f+1+2 to obtain +frames on block or give a guaranteed DES uf+1+2(~1+2) B! on hit. Use DES 1 for a faster mid which gives a guaranteed DES d+1 on hit. Use DES 1+2 to catch people trying to sidestep/sidewalk out of the wall. Finally, Use DES d+1 for people who do not duck at the wall for a good 30 damage and +1.
</p><p><b><big>db+3</big></b>
</p><p>This move is very important in Alisa's gameplay and it deserves a section on its own.
</p><p>When Alisa was first introduced in T6:BR, this move was really good. It was considered as one of the best lows in the game, only rivalled by hellsweeps (which are the actual best lows in the game). Having absurdly long range, db+3 was even on hit and gave +7 frames on CH, while only being -11 on block. Not only do your opponents only get their standard ws+4 punishers for blocking it, db+3 also had a "safe range" where if it was blocked at the very tip of the foot, standard ws+4's will whiff, allowing Alisa to whiff punish with df+2. Also, with its great range, this move can safely hit characters out of their low stances, namely Xiaoyu AOP, Christie/Eddy RLX, and Zafina TRT. Needless to say, db+3 was abused to the point where Alisa's gameplay revolved around it.
</p><p>Moving onward to TTT2, this move was nerfed, but it was needed. db+3 now leaves you at -2 on hit and -13 on block, but it still retained the positive frames you got on CH. db+3 still has its great range and the "safe range" still exists, so it remains one of her best moves. On block, you will most likely eat ws+4, but some characters have better punishers (Dragunov ws+1+2 and Lars ws+2,1 for example) or even launchers (Kazuya ws+1,2 and Bruce ws+2,1) so be careful using this move against these characters.
</p><p>Possible mixups after hitting this move (normal hit) include:
</p>
<ul><li> backdash: properly spaced, a backdash will evade most attacks your opponent can do. Whiff punish accordingly.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> ws+4: a safe move to throw out if your opponent isn't aware that db+3 is now -2 on hit. df+1's will trade and 12f mids will outspeed you, so do not do this if you're opponent knows that he/she can beat you out of this move.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> FC df+1+2: good to throw out if your opponent does not move at all
</li></ul>
<p><br />
There are better mixups when you land db+3 counterhit, but there's no visual indicator (e.g. sparks) for the counterhit other than noticing your opponent's move animation getting interrupted, so it's difficult to see.
</p><p>These mixups include:
ws+4: now uninterruptible if db+3 lands CH, so it's the safer option to throw out to catch your opponent trying to poke.
</p><p>ws+1,2: also uninterruptible, use this only if you're absolutely certain that db+3 was CH and your opponent will attack. If you try this when db+3 is only NH, you will get ducked and launched for even trying.
</p><p>uf+4,4: also uninterruptible, use this if you know that your opponent will try to attack you out of the mixup.
</p><p>iWR+2: strict timing to make it uninterruptible, but it still works. Catches your opponent if he tries to backdash out of the mixup. Use it to keep up the pressure.
</p><p>iWR+3,4: mid mixup to iWR+2, but you may get jabbed out of this, so be careful.
</p><p>FC df+1+2: now better due to the +frames you got, but it's still only good to use if your opponent does not move at all
</p><p>grabs: you should know what to do with these by now
</p><p><br />
db+3 will be your go-to low in almost every situation. Study this move and learn the "safe range". Use it and abuse it.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Poking_Game"> Poking Game </span></h3>
<p>Alisa's poking game is excellent due to her long reach and ability to space herself. One could say that most of Alisa's damage comes from going in, poking, then going back out. This will lead to two possible outcomes: either you poke the opponent to death, or your opponent reacts, upon which you then use Alisa's great movement to make them whiff and punish accordingly.
</p><p>df+4
</p><p>df+4 is Alisa's fastest mid clocking in at 12 frames. It tracks slightly to Alisa's right, but do not rely on this because it can be sidewalked both directions if your opponent anticipates it. df+4 is safe so do not be afraid to throw it out every now and then. This move has good reach, use it to force whiffs by moving out immediately after.
</p><p>df+1 and extensions
</p><p>Unlike generic df+1's which track to the user's left, Alisa's df+1 tracks to her right. At 13 frames, this move is fast and can catch your opponent out of his/her attempts to poke or evade. df+1 is safe so there is little to no risk involved. If your opponent likes to attack after blocking this, you can decide to continue to her extensions; df+1,1,2 and df+1,4.
</p><p>df+1,1,2 is a m,h,h string which gives you +6 frames on block and puts you in DES form. The second and third hit are NC, meaning if the second hit connects, the third is guaranteed. If your opponent does not duck the high, you can use it to create opportunities for DES mixups. Be careful in throwing this out as the second hit does not jail and you may get launched for it.
</p><p>df+1,4 is a m,m NCc string. The 4 can interrupt your opponent's attempt to poke you after blocking df+1, so it is worth using against poke-happy opponents. It puts them in crouch on hit, essentially blocking them from sidewalking to the foreground. Use this opportunity to land moves that track to the appropriate direction; you may catch them as they attempt to sidestep to the background. The entire string is -9 on block, so you will be safe, but attempting to move risks getting jabbed.
</p><p>b+1
</p><p>Alisa's b+1 is a 15f safe mid which tracks both directions. Needless to say, this is a very good move. Use it when you're not sure what your opponent will do because it can cover a lot of situations. There is an extension (b+1,1+2) but it is beyond useless and you should never use that move. You end up in FC after b+1, allowing you to use the following crouching mixups:
</p><p>ws+4: outspeeds anything your opponent can do if b+1 hits. If b+1 is blocked, your opponent can sidestep/backdash out of this and punish you, so be careful.
</p><p>ws+1,2: also outspeeds anything your opponent can do if b+1 hits, but this move is riskier as it does not jail and you may get launched for doing this.
</p><p>ws+1+2: a safe tracking mid which can catch your opponent if they like to sidestep. On hit, dash db+3 is really good as it connects more often than it should. You can hold 1+2 to increase the number of spins, which gives you better frames on block.
</p><p>(2 spins) ws+[1+2]: slower than the non-held version, this move leads to better options when it is blocked. It's neutral on block so you're at parity with your opponent. On hit, your opponent falls over; dash d+4,1+2 is a guaranteed mini-combo.
</p><p>FC df+1+2: a good low to mixup with ws+1+2 as both attacks make Alisa spin. You end up in FC after hitting this so you can use the same mixup options listed here. On block, you're likely to eat ws+4 from your opponent.
</p><p>FC db,d,db+1+2: her FC grab, only use this if your opponent remains perfectly still after you land b+1.
</p><p>db+3
</p><p>Refer to the db+3 section above.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Keepout_Game"> Keepout Game </span></h3>
<p>Keepout is another aspect where Alisa excels, therefore one must learn how to distance himself from his/her opponent. Use these attacks along with Alisa's movement in order to get out of sticky situations.
</p><p>1,1
</p><p>10f jab string which gives good damage. Use this when you're sure you can interrupt your opponent's attacks, and when you sidestep something with short whiff frames. Do not throw this out randomly as the second hit can be ducked and punished.
</p><p>Magic 4
</p><p>13f safe high which KNDs your opponent on hit and is a launcher on CH. Very good move to use when your opponent is pitbulling you. Time it well, like when your opponent throws out a move which is -4 on block or worse.
</p><p>df+4
</p><p>Same uses as poking. Use its good range to backdash after and get yourself out.
</p><p>db+3
</p><p>Similar to df+4, use this to backdash out and get to safety. Or you can apply pressure yourself by doing the mixups listed in the db+3 section above. Your choice.
</p><p>b+3
</p><p>A bit slow to use for keepout, but it works from time to time, so I listed it here. Use this when your opponent sidesteps after his pokes (df+1, ss for example) to catch them. It's safe on block so the risk/reward is in your favor.
</p><p>backdash
</p><p>With Alisa's great movement, you're almost certain to be able to backdash out of most situations. Use this to force whiffs.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Chaining_and_Frame_Traps"> Chaining and Frame Traps </span></h3>
<p>Chaining is performing a series of moves/strings while you are in positive frames, which make your opponent unable to interrupt them. It is possible to continuously chain your opponent with these moves, giving you prime opportunities to score a knockdown, wall splat, or launcher.
</p><p>Most of Alisa's chaining strats involve her being in DES. Keep in mind that her fastest DES move is DES f+1 at 12f.
</p><p>Frame traps involve using specific moves which do not allow your opponent to interrupt, forcing them to stay still and/or try to sidestep. Attempting to interrupt frame traps results in getting hit by the trap, taking damage and possibly getting knocked down. Frame traps usually occur whenever you are in positive frames, then using appropriate moves to allow you to continue keeping up pressure.
</p><p><br />
Positive/Even frames on block (in descending order)
</p>
<ul><li> DES FLY 1: +9
</li><li> (df+1,1),2: +6
</li><li> FLY 2: +4~+17 (currently unknown)
</li><li> iWR+2: +4
</li><li> DES f+1+2: +3
</li><li> 1: +1
</li><li> BT 3+4: +1, opponent FC
</li><li> ws+[1+2] (2 spins): 0
</li></ul>
<p>Example frame traps
</p>
<ul><li> DES FLY 1 (block, +9), DES 1 (14f)
</li><li> DES f+1+2 (block, +3), DES f+1 (12f)
</li><li> iWR+2 (block, +4), 1,1_df+4_df+1 (10/12/13f respectively)
</li><li> 1,1 (hit, +4), 1,1_df+4_df+1 (10/12/13f respectively)
</li></ul>
<p>Example hit chains
</p>
<ul><li> (db+2),2 (hit, +14), f+1+2 (hit, +7), b+1 (15f, tracks both sides - forces opponent to block) -&gt; apply FC mixups
</li><li> f+1+2 (hit, +7), iWR+2 (16f, block +4; hit KND), 1,1_df+4_df+1 (10/12/13f respectively)
</li><li> CH db+3 (hit, +7), iWR+2 (16f, block +4; hit KND), 1,1_df+4_df+1 (10/12/13f respectively) 
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Destroy_Form"> Destroy Form </span></h3>
<p>Destroy form (DES for short) is one of Alisa's stances. It is very good to use in keeping up pressure because the stance has very good moves that give +f on block and on hit, as well as the "electric sidestep" DES u_d+3+4 which evades everything that isn't homing. Plus, who wouldn't get intimidated by chainsaws?
</p><p>DES 1
</p><p>14f mid which knocks your opponent down in FDFT position. Very good move to throw out in the open as it's safe and it does good damage.
</p><p>DES f+1
</p><p>12f high which leads to +1f on block. Her fastest move out of DES, this is Alisa's main interruptor for aggressive opponents.
</p><p>DES d+1
</p><p>Main low out of DES, does good damage and is only punishable by ws+4 on block. Tracks to Alisa's left.
</p><p>DES 2
</p><p>Safe mid launcher out of DES. Tag bufferable. On block, DES u_d+3+4 evades most stuff. On hit, you can tag to your partner (preferred) or follow-up with DES uf+1+2(~1+2 to get out of DES) to bound.
</p><p>DES d+2
</p><p>Another low out of DES, this one tracks to Alisa's right instead. You can hold 2 to increase the number of hits, up to 6. -12 on block, but can only be punished by FC d+4 due to pushback. However, the move is slow so you might get backdashed and/or hopkicked out of it.
</p><p>DES 1+2
</p><p>Safe, high homing move out of DES. Does good damage and wall splats to hit people who like to sidestep to get out of the wall.
</p><p>DES f+1+2
</p><p>Slow mid move out of DES which gives +3 on block. On block, DES f+1 interrupts your opponent's attacks (except the high crush ones), while DES 1 interrups everything that isn't jabs. On hit, the opponent is stunned, you can follow-up with DES f+3+4,2,1(~1+2) or DES uf+1+2(~1+2) to bound.
</p><p>DES u_d+3+4
</p><p>The "electric sidestep" out of DES, this move evades as if you sidestepped three times in one direction. Be careful though as your opponent can wait for you to land and then launch you.
</p><p>DES u_d+3+4,1
</p><p>New to TTT2, the follow-up is a horizontal mid swipe which knocks your opponent down. Good to use once you see that you evaded something with DES u_d+3+4. On hit, DES d+1 is guaranteed, but only 2 out of 6 hits will connect, so it's very minimal damage and not worth it. On block, it's at least -17 and you will get hit by long range attacks (for example, Leo ff+2) or even launched by long range launchers, namely Asuka/Jun f+2.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fighting_aggressive_players"> Fighting aggressive players </span></h3>
<p>Alisa has an easier time handling aggressive players compared to turtles. Wait for punishable moves then retaliate. Utilize her movement along with her long range pokes in order to create space. Punish whiffs with 1,1 and heavy whiffs with df+2, then utilize the +f you obtain (from 1,1) in order to perform mixups. Catch sidesteps with b+1 and do the mixups listed above.
</p><p>When they obtain a life lead and sit on it (they turtle), go in and mount an offensive. Upon blocking, expect them to attack back as they thrive on keeping up pressure. Use frame traps when they attack back in order to land hits, then continue attacking and doing mixups. When they block instead, hang back and turtle again.
</p><p>Just be patient and turtle your way to victory.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fighting_turtles"> Fighting turtles </span></h3>
<p>I'm not going to beat around the bush here. Alisa has problems fighting turtles. Her spacing is almost useless because your opponent will just sit there and block. They will rarely do punishable attacks so that option is out the window as well. Thus, you are only left with small damage pokes and grabs.
</p><p>db+3 is your friend. It will be your go-to low in order to hit your opponent 16 damage at a time. Utilize the "safe range" in order to bait whiffed ws+4's and punish with df+2. Do not let that whiff go unpunished. Alisa rarely has opportunities to launch turtles so you should take whatever you can get.
</p><p>df+4 will be one of your go-to mids along with b+1. Use df+4's range to poke safely and get yourself out when things go bad. Use b+1 to hit attempted sidesteps and do the mixups listed above. If b+1 is blocked, check if your opponent likes to poke back or if he continues to turtle. If they like to poke back, just block and turtle yourself. If they continue to turtle, mixup with FC df+1+2 and ws+1+2.
</p><p>iWR+2 is good to obtain +frames and keep up the pressure. This will force the turtle to block and remain safe. Use this opportunity to land lows and grabs.
</p><p>Against the most extreme of turtles who barely push a button at all, just dash in and mixup with FC df+1+2(~1+2 to go into DES) and ws+1+2. They have no choice but to guess as both options catch backdash and ws+1+2 catches sidestep/sidewalk. Or they can attack to prevent you from going in, but then they are attacking, so they're not turtling anymore.
</p><p>Other riskier moves that give better reward include db+4 and grabs. db+4 is good if your opponent remains still, but it can be seen from time to time. Remedy this by sidestepping before doing the move as the sidestep kinda hides the animation frames a bit. Grabs are good to break the turtle down as they cannot be blocked, only escaped. However, they can hopkick to render your grab useless, so be careful. When you successfully land a grab, immediately follow-up with post-grab oki (listed below) in order to create opportunities for damage.
</p><p>When you obtain a life lead against turtles, just sit on it and turtle yourself. They will be forced to go on the offensive and fight out of their natural playstyle. This is good for you because they play worse and you have better tools to fight aggressive players anyway.
</p><p>When in doubt, go for a knockdown then immediately tag out. Your partner should be able to handle turtles better. If not, then you're in trouble.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Post-grab_oki"> Post-grab oki </span></h3>
<p>Alisa's grab game is downright pitiful. She barely gets any oki off her grabs and their break windows are just average.
</p><p>1+3
stay put: dash then throw out a low of your choice, preferably db+4 because it catches siderollers too
sideroll: db+4 to hit them for good damage
quickstand: use bf+2 to hit them in the back. Follow-up with a guaranteed db+3.
sideroll then quickstand: dash then ws+1,2,3 to hit them in the back, launching them. Follow-up with 1 to flip them in the normal juggle axis.
backroll: iWR+3,4 to hit them in the back. This is better compared to iWR+2 because it's mid and hits even if you mess up the timing.
front roll: no sane opponent should front roll to you, but in case they do, do ws+1,2,3 to hit them in the back and launch them.
</p><p>2+4
stay put: dash db+3
sideroll: nothing
quickstand: nothing; iWR+2 to get +4 frames
sideroll then quickstand: iWR+3,4
backroll: nothing
front roll: no sane opponent will do this
</p><p>uf+1+2
stay put: dash db+3
sideroll: nothing
quickstand: nothing; iWR+2 to get +4 frames
sideroll then quickstand: nothing; iWR+2 to get +4 frames
backroll: nothing
front roll: again, no one's gonna do this, but just in case, b+1 to float for a juggle
at the wall: d+2,4
</p><p>FC db,d,db+1+2
stay put: dash db+3
sideroll: nothing
quickstand: iWR+3,4

front roll: dash ws+1,2,3
tag buffer to partner: FUFT oki options
</p><p>d+1+2+3 (generic female headdress item move)
same oki as 1+3 grab
</p><p>As you can see, her grab oki is horrible. Just get your 35-45 damage and get out.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tag_Specific_Information"> Tag Specific Information </span></h3>
<p>Since the game is called Tekken Tag Tournament 2 for a reason, I've listed all the information related to tag situations with Alisa.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Character_Allegiance"> Character Allegiance </span></h4>
<p>Character Allegiance dictates when Alisa or her partner enters rage status. Rage is obtained when the point character has taken a specific amount of damage without having tagged out. Having good allegiance (+1) puts the secondary character in rage faster while having bad allegiance (-1 and -2) puts the secondary character in rage slower, with -2 being slower than -1.
</p><p>Note: Getting hit by Tag Assault still puts your partner in rage.
</p><p><br />
Alisa on Point<br />
</p><p>+1: Lars, Lee, Panda, Xiaoyu, Yoshimitsu<br />
</p><p>-1: Asuka, Bryan, Jack-6, Raven<br />
</p><p>-2: Jin, Lili, Mokujin<br />
</p><p><br />
Alisa on Secondary<br />
</p><p>+1: Jack-6, Jin, Lars, Lee, Raven, Xiaoyu, Yoshimitsu, Zafina<br />
</p><p>-1: Ogre<br />
</p><p>-2: Bryan<br />
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Special_Tag_Throws"> Special Tag Throws </span></h4>
<p>Tag throws allow Alisa to tag in/out to her partner while dealing red life damage. These are very useful as they allow a safe way to get your point character out without getting launched.
</p><p>Alisa on Point<br />
</p><p>1+3~5 (partner Jack-6) - She does her 1+3 then throws her opponent to Jack who slams them down.<br />
</p><p>2+4~5 (partner Lars) - She does her 2+4 but instead of stabbing with her chainsaw, Lars comes in and brings them down from the air. Good oki as db+2,1 catches quickstand, front roll, and backroll while db+4 covers everything else.
</p><p>Alisa on Secondary<br />
</p><p>Asuka b+1+2~5 - Asuka does her b+1+2, then Alisa comes in and does her back throw. Does less damage than her back throw, but with the same oki.<br />
</p><p>Jaycee 1+3~5 - Suplex into missile.<br />
</p><p>Lars 2+4~5 - Lars does his 2+4, then Alisa comes in and they simultaneously do a cross-up attack. Leaves the opponent at FDFA near Alisa. Great oki afterwards.<br />
</p><p>Miharu f+2+3~5 - Miharu's f+2+3, then Alisa flies in and stomps the opponent at their back.<br />
</p><p>Xiaoyu f+2+3~5 - Xiaoyu's f+2+3, then Alisa flies in and stomps the opponent at their back.<br />
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Taggable_Attacks"> Taggable Attacks </span></h3>
<p>Alisa only has one taggable attack, and it's not that good. Better than nothing I suppose.
</p><p>ff+4~5 (partner Miharu) - Alisa's ff+4 into Miharu's f+1+2. Does not occur when ff+4 is blocked.<br />
</p><p>ff+4~5 (partner Xiaoyu) - Alisa's ff+4 into Xiaoyu's f+1+2. Does not occur when ff+4 is blocked.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Taggable_Launchers"> Taggable Launchers </span></h3>
<p>Alisa's taggable launchers are slow, thus they are rarely used for punishment, with the exception of ws+2. Use only for whiff punishment.
</p>
<ul><li> b+3+4~5
