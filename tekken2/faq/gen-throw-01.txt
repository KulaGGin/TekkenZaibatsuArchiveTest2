Tekken 2 Timings & Breakouts

This section will verbosely describe the timing required to execute
the more complex moves in Tekken 2 (usually multi-part throws).
They will be listed alphabetically by character. This section
now also includes how to break the multis. The timings
will generally take the following format:

Starting move (button presses needed here to break and stop
the NEXT move from happening)
Condition that needs to be met to do the next move...
The next move (button presses needed here to break and stop
the NEXT move from happening)
Condition that needs to be met to do the next move...
So on

If you have any questions about these timings, or problems, please
E-mail me using the address at the bottom of the page.

PS: After working on these timings for a while, I noticed that
the computer actually IS pretty flexible on TIMING, but INFLEXIBLE
and button presses. If you don't press "together buttons"
(1+2, 3+4, etc.) together, things just DON'T work right!!
