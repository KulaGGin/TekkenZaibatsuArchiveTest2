Welcome to my FAQ on Baek Doo San. Baek is the sub-boss of Law, and, unlike
most sub-bosses, has his own unique moves, for the most part. If you have
any questions or ideas to improve this FAQ, contact me at
surfbard@usa.pipeline.com. Thanks, and enjoy!

Commentary on some of Baek's moves
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

f,N,d,df+LK                 Wing Blade
Baek ducks, and thrusts his leg up at you, sending you very, very high
straight up. This move is a good setup for juggle combos, shown below, and
takes a fair amount of life away.

f,f,RK                      Hammer Heel
A variation of Kazuya's axe kicks, this one will go up in the air, and come
down to the ground instead of back. It hits opponents on the ground, but
they have to be a few steps away.

f,f,f,LK                    Killing Blade
This is pretty much the same as most other f,f,f,LK moves in this game: Baek
runs and does a jumpkick. This stuns if blocks, and that can open up a short
period where you can launch a combo.

u,d+LK                      Jump Spin Crescent Kick
Baek jumps, and when he's about to land, gives a kick to the middle. The
flaw with this move is the time it takes to execute ; you can easily be
knocked out of your jump before you kick.

db+LK+RK                    Heel Explosion
This unblockable move, like the others, takes a good period of time to

"charge up". If it hits, a good portion of your opponent's life will be
taken away. Of course, that nasty time period will give your opponent a
fair chance to throw you or hit you with a combo, if they're early enough.
