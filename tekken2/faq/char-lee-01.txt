- this strategy guide is dedicated to the Lee players who don't like Law due
 to the ease (cheese) of his flipkicks, as well as those annoying yells
(chicken-boy!).

A)  GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF LEE CHAOLAN

Lee is a good all-around player, but he is somewhat weaker than many
characters, so why do I play him?.  The reason is because his slide and
backflip are just too cool!  Not because of his powerful combos, since he
doesn't really have any.  Lee's best combos do about 50% damage, which isn't
bad, but some characters have 80%+ combos, so he's not as powerful as they 
are. In addition, Lee's damaging combos can only be used to full capacity in 
quite specific situations, which makes their usefulness a little limited.

Lee's main strength lies in his speed and quick recovery time, as well as
his own unique moves that are quite useful.  Lee also has enough attacks
to mix up combos fairly effectively.

Lee Chaolan is a fairly average ranged offensive player, which means he
has good attacks for medium and close ranges, however, most of his combos are
close range. Lee has lots of good offensive moves, but not a lot of good
defensive moves, except to try to interrupt opponent attacks with fast
combos/kick/punch.

C)  LEE'S COMBO LIST
-------------------------

A combo is a chain of moves that once the first hit is connected, other
hits cannot be blocked.  Only the first 2 are true combos, and even then the
Low-High combo must be started right_next to the opponent for all kicks to
hit.  The other combos can be blocked after a few hits, unless started as a
counter hit, then they become unblockable.  I'm not sure of exact damages, so 
I'm guessing. (I could be way off, but I think they're close)

1) f+2,2,2    (25-30%?)      Dragon Knuckle combo
2) D+3,3,3,3  (45%?)        Low-High Kick combo
3) 4,3,4        (30%?)      Spinning Kick combo
4) D+4,4,4,4        (35%?)    Razor Edge combo
5) F+1,1,1,1,2,2,2 (40-45%?)  Fist Flurry


Discussion of the combos and moves


Lee's slide is very useful, since a lot of the time you're fairly safe even
if it's blocked or it misses, just don't overuse it since it is slow to start,
so Lee can be knocked out of it quite easily before it comes out.  Try to have 
a bit of range between you and your opponent when you do it.  As well, good 
players will also figure out how to get you good when it misses, so overuse it
at your own risk. (eg: Jack's low scissor, as soon as you start to move)  You 
can play possum if it misses against the CPU, (totally misses, not blocked) 
however, I wouldn't recommend it against human opponents.

The double jump kick is also very useful, especially as a run-in spin off,
just vary the range (ie: start it out of range so that both your first kick
and your opponent's kick/punch whiff, but your second kick connects) if you
think your opponent is expecting it.  It's pretty much a good idea to always
hold down or forward after the first kick if you want to play it safe, and
minimize the chance that your opponent will pop up and throw you after the
second kick.  If opponents wait for you to do the double jump kick once
they've begun to expect it, throw out the slide, followed by a rising sweep
and do it again immediately, before they get used to it.  Again, don't
overuse this and in particular, use the second slide very sparingly.

The Spinning Kicks are very fast, and quite effective at interrupting
opponents who like to move in fast and start combos or run in and jump kick,
so try to use them this way.  They can be ducked quite easily though, so be
careful.  Against better players, you're usually better off to just do the
first two, unless it's a juggle, since the first two are unbreakable if the
first connects, but the third can be ducked or blocked.  In addition, once
people start ducking them before or after the first kick, use the N+4~U+3
combo to flipkick the crouching opponent for a possible juggle the next time
instead of the 3 kicks (might be too far for a juggle, but if not - Fist
Flurry works great, or probably the Low-High) or a sure-fire slide, possible
sweep combo. Experiment with the juggling.

His flipkick is generally not that useful on its own except to catch
opponents who like to pounce towards you while you're standing. (eg. Armor
King)  It can still catch people off-guard if used sparingly, it's just that 
he's got faster combos that work just as well.  However, if you can connect
with the uf flipkick, go for the juggle as above.

As far as I can tell, Lee's speed is second to none, and matched by few
characters, so virtually every time Lee and an opponent start combos at the
same time, Lee's connects first. (assuming it was one of Lee's fast combos)
Knowing this, anytime you think you see an opening, launch a punch combo,
since they're fast, easy and have good recovery time.  I prefer to use the
F+2,2,2 since if the first hits, it's unbreakable, whereas the 1,1,1...can
usually be blocked after the first two hits.  For some reason, everyone
seems to underestimate Lee's recovery time and always tries to throw after
blocking the punch combo.  Duck immediately after doing the combo, then come
back up and throw them after they try for the grab, or if you want to do
more damage and not chance missing, come up with the first 4-6 hits
(depending on how close they are) of Lee's infinite combo for a whopping
approx. 50% damage.

Lee's Razor Edge combo definitely has the most potential to be overused,
since it's his only multiple low hit attack.  I usually use this as a
fallback nearing the end of a round when both myself and my opponent only
have about 25% life or less, since by then opponents usually aren't
expecting it.  Try not to do this too much, or opponents will begin
anticipating it, and Lee is vulnerable for an instant after it.  You can
also use it as a counter hit when attacks whiff in front of you, but this
leaves you a little open if blocked, so you should probably stick with the
Dragon Knuckle combo for fast recovery.  Alternately, you can only throw out
the first two hits of the Razor Edge to confuse opponents, since Lee's
recovery time is good from there.

Lee also has his flip drop attack that hits as it comes down, (D#,'u or
uf'+3+4) he lands on them with his elbow/falls on them.  This is a good
surprise move, since most players won't know what the heck you're doing for
at least the first few times. (I've yet to see a Law player use this)

Lee's infinite (as above - WS+3,3,D+3,3,3....) can be kind of cheap to use
since I find it's hard to knock Lee out of it.  It's still very possible,
you just have to time it right, which can be difficult.  Lee's infinite is
extremely useful against players who do lots of close high attacks or
throws.  Just duck under whatever they do (assuming they're going high) and
come up with the first 4-6 hits of the infinite just like the CPU.

Finally Lee has his backflip, (b,b,N+3+4) which at first glance doesn't seem
to be very useful since it is a little slow.  It's good to put some distance
between you and your opponent, although most run right after you after you
do it.  If they do, as you land start the double jump kick or a fast combo
as they come in to keep them from chasing you too much.  It is also very
effective to avoid Yoshimitsu's helicopter stomp as well as P.Jack's flying
stomp.  (assuming they started while you were standing)

D)  Lee's throws
--------------------

Lee has 3 throws (please look at the moves section above). 

1)  Neck Fracture (1+3) (30%?, see below) -
This is the most common throw, which is also unique to Lee, and enables you
to sweep immediately after falling to the ground beside the opponent for
another hit. (sweep doesn't work on CPU though, roll away and come back with
his slide, then sweep)

2)  Chastisement Punch (2+4) (30%?) -
This throw makes it difficult to sweep the opponent afterwards, since they're 
just too far away to run in and sweep if they get up immediately, but if it's 
a big character, and they try to roll away to get up, you can do the Low-High 
Kick combo for a 2-3 hit juggle. (they have to start moving for it to hit 
though)

3)  Knee Bash (f,f+3+4) (30%?) -
This throw is a very fast grab the opponent and smash his head on your knee, 
and also results in Lee being too far for a sweep, however, Lee recovers from 
this throw very fast, so you usually have time to run in and then sweep.

E) Lee's unblockables
-------------------------

Lee's Silver Fang unblockable is not very impressive when first viewed, as
it does a measly 40% damages (as oppose to Paul - 80%, Lei - 70%).  Not only
that, but it is so slow Lee might as well be wearing a sign saying "Hit Me!"
The only good use for this unblockable in my opinion is to start it, and
then immediately abort it to try to fake out an opponent.

Lee's Silver Cyclone, on the other hand is good for a surprise if someone
hasn't seen it before, since Lee ducks down while charging it, causing high
attacks to whiff, and then, WAANNGYAA!  It does come out reasonably fast,
but damage is still only around 40-50%, and as soon as opponents find out
it can be ducked it, it immediately loses most of its effectiveness.  It'd
be fun to use against some Law player who likes to do the double flip kick
too far away hoping you'll run into the second, since I'm pretty sure it
would come out just as he landed from the second.

F) LEE CHAOLAN'S TEN HIT STRING
----------------------------------

Sorry, I can't comment on this, I've never really bothered to learn it,
although I tried to do it a few times on the CPU and it doesn't seem that
effective to me.

G) LEE CHAOLAN V.S. THE WHOLE WORLD
--------------------------------------

1) Lee Chaolan V.S. the CPU (version B)
level 1 : Have fun. Try your combos, 10 hit string etc.

Level 2 : Have fun. Try all your combos, 10 hit string. Consider giving
the CPU second round :P

level 3 : The CPU starts to get tricky. No problem. Just run (f,f) up to the
CPU character and throw him a couple of time to get out of sticky
situations. The Neck Fracture (1+3) is good to use because you can roll
awayand follow with the slide (f,f,N,3+4).  Start tapping forward as you get
up so that after you stand, Lee will move slightly forward, then just hit
3+4.  Remember you don't have to stand extremely close to throw.  Just
stand within the distance where yours hand can touch his/her hands.

level 4 : This is where I start opening the round by always trying for a
throw, as well as start playing the character the CPU is using against me.

V.S. Yoshimitsu - wait for his double roundhouse (get practiced so the
second whiffs or duck under it) and either Dragon Knuckle, flipkick, Razor
Edge, Spin Kick (4,3), or do a WS+2 (juggles)

V.S. King - Back off a few steps at the beginning of the round and try to
stay about this distance away from him as much as you can.  Wait for him to
do the Frakensteiner and sweep when it misses, you can try for his juggling
Low-High Kick combo as he gets up, too.  Also, watch out for his Ali-kick,
uppercut and his Ali-kicks.  He also does the motion to grab you with a
multi-part quite often, watch out for it.

V.S. Lei - This H.K. cop loves to do his punch + back punch to you. Just
duck both then do a flipkick, a WS+2 (juggles), the infinite, or a back
throw.

V.S. Jack. This big guy is slow, so try to use the Dragon Knuckle and
Spinning kicks to interrupt his attacks a lot.  In particular, wait for his
two lunging punches, and try to get practiced so you can make the second one
whiff, then just move in with the Dragon Knuckle.  Try the double jump kicks
too.

V.S. Roger/Alex - They like to do the Frakensteiner and love to do that
sitting down kick.  Treat them like King, but duck under the sitting kick
then sweep or do a standing axe kick. (WS+3,3 - you can duck under the
sitting kick no problem, if you've got the distance right)

V.S. Paul - Just wait for him to finish his falling leave combo and throw,
Dragon Knuckle, Low-High Kick combo (every one hits - most damage)
or Spinning Kick him (4,3).

V.S. Michelle - Wait just within range of her low kick and as soon as she
starts something, (usually the punch, sweep) hop back quick, then hop back
in with Lee's axe kick (f,f+3 - use the 2 f's for the hop as well as the
kick) or right after the sweep whiffs, do the Razor Edge and hope it's a
counter hit, or try for the double jump kick. (pretty much have to use
the f,f,f+3,4)

V.S. Nina - Wait for her to do a combo and duck under it, since she tends to
go high.  Come up with the infinite like Heihachi or the WS+2.

V.S. Jun - Wait out of range for her to run in at you, and hop back as soon
as she starts.  Be prepared to duck even after this since she loves to
throw.  However, sooner or later, she does the cartwheel kick, you've got to
back off enough so that it whiffs, then move in fast with the Dragon
Knuckle.

V.S. Law - Try to get him to do high combos, then duck under them and go for
4-6 hits from his infinite.  Be very prepared to block low as Law loves to
hop in and low kick, low sweep and low jab you.  Immediately after blocking
a low attack, while still holding down, hit 4 once to whittle at him. (or
any other character)

Level 5 : CPU will just sit back and relax and wait for your mistakes.  If
you are no good, it will block everything  you throw at it and give you what
you deserved.  Keep playing the character using their weaknesses (CPU) to
your advantage.  You can still throw the CPU fairly easily, and if you do
the Neck Fracture, try for the roll away, slide as you can usually get up by
rolling back without fear of punishment if the slide is blocked.  Use low
punch or kick if you just need one more hit to finish the CPU. (d+1 or D#,4)

Level 6 : Throws get hard to pull off. You're probably better off not trying
for them after an attempt at the start of the round since the CPU almost 
always breaks free. Don't just walk up to the computer and attempt a throw. 
You might even get reversed.  Attempt a throw only after the CPU has done 
something wrong (after a combo).

Level 7 : Time to show your stuff!! Play the character, and exploit their
weaknesses. Cheese, throw, pattern-remembering, passively aggressive, you
name it. Against him/her you have to use something you that you have not
used before if you want to play aggressively.


Level 8 : Heihachi - He is tough.  Use the Razor Edge or Dragon Knuckle if
any attacks whiff in front of your face, in particular, try to hit Heihachi
with the Razor Edge as soon as he starts something, if you can tag him, it
usually turns the Razor Edge into an unblockable.  Finally, the most
effective strategy, try to get him to whiff a high roundhouse or miss a
throw while you're ducking it, and come up with the first 4-5 hits of Lee's
infinite combo.  This does about 50% so if you can get it twice, you should
have him.


Level 9 : Kazuya Mishima is even tougher than Heihachi, use the strategy for
Jun, backing off as soon as you see him coming towards you, and keep
backing off until you see him do an attack.  If he whiffs the jumping
uppercut, or puts his head down, nail him with the Dragon Knuckle.  If he
starts to duck, however, quickly launch the Dragon Knuckle.  The
best strategy is the same as Heihachi's, the infinite for 50%, however it's
much harder to get Kazuya to whiff a kick so you have to watch for his
missed throw.  You can also start the infinite if you can block his hell
sweeps, but you can only get 1-3 hits max if that. (knocks him back a bit 
though) Cheese (medium difficulty don't know if it works on harder levels):
After knocking him over with the Dragon Knuckle, run over right next to him
immediately, then back off once.  He rises with an attack, wait for it to
whiff then nail him with the Dragon Knuckle again and repeat.


Level 10 : Devil is actually much easier than Kazuya or Heihachi to me.
Devil pretty much constantly whiffs high roundhouses and throws, perfect for
4-5 hits from the infinite.  Be careful not to get knocked over, since he
may not let you get up before 3-4 sweeps.  When Devil does the ground
laser, duck!  If you're close enough, the infinite will tag him as you rise.
 When he air lasers, run towards him and nail him as he comes down.

2) Lee Chaolan V.S. local scrubs and button mashers

First of all, have no mercy.  Pound the opponent into the ground if you
really want to win, since Lee's attacks are only average and opponents
usually have better damage.  Constantly be on guard, even against people who
don't know what they're doing, I've seen some pretty good locals lose to
button mashers taking Paul! (due to sheer unpredictability)

Actually, I find Lee can actually be tough to play against Law scrubs and
button mashers (unless you want to destroy them with his infinite...) since
even though the flipkick is SOOO predictable, if one connects, you can lose
50% life in an instant, due to juggling and pouncing.  After blocking the
flipkick, nail him with the Dragon Knuckle to ensure they can't block before
being hit.  In addition, most Law players I've played against aren't used to
their own attacks and tend to eat the last hit or two of the Dragon Knuckle
by trying to duck under it, or are always surprised when the Spinning kicks
knocks them out of a combo/running jump kick, even though they do it all the
time with Law.

Against Baek, watch out for his his kick which juggles you high, since you
can take major damage from a juggle combo too.  Again, most of these players
aren't used to having their attacks interrupted, so be a little more
aggressive than normal, just don't go too crazy.  If they insist on doing
his stupid 4 low sweeps combo, block it low then punish them with the
infinite.

Scrubs are also usually poor at blocking the Razor Edge, so you can probably
use it without fear of punishment.

It is sometimes fun to see some of the expert player losing to button
masher. (What the hell? I, the supreme Nina/ Paul/ Wang/ Michelle etc..lost
to a 4'11" 7-years-old who doesn't know what he is doing?) The piss-off look
on their face is very entertaining.  Well, to people who never learn the
trick to fight V.S. button smasher, they deserved to die. Sorry if I
offended anyone, but that is life. Swim or sink. There are cheap moves, but
you better figure out a way to counter them. If some mindless scrub keep
doing something to you and you don't like it, stop playing the game for a
while, think of a cure for it. And then be the comeback kid. No point in
steaming, or risk your life in real physical tekken fight over $0.50. (I saw
that happen many times)

Me, I usually have trouble getting a long winning streak, since I tend to
take characters I'm trying to learn after a few wins, and then lose.  Not
that I can just keep winning with my characters of preference, it's just I
can get a longer streak for sure.  There's also the fact that many fights
turn into knock-over, sweep wars which I find to be kind of boring, so I
generally don't sweep (or Low-High) more than twice after a knock down even
if the dumb Jack-2 player just keeps rolling away, instead of to the side or
just straight getting up.  I think there's only a few other players like me
in the area in this respect, since virtually everyone here will sweep/attack
low to keep you from getting up the entire fight if they'll win.  In fact,
many scrubs depend on this to get them the win.


3) Lee Chaolan V.S. Turtles
Ever play a turtle who ducks down and block all the time, and waits
for your mistake?  Lee has lots of interesting ways to deal with these
people.  First of all, his axe kick (f,F+3) will get these players for some
good one-hit damage.  He also has his flip drop that hits low, and is very
seldom used, so it usually catches them by surprise.  His kick, flipkick
combo can be very useful against turtles, giving you the opportunity to try
for some juggles.  Finally the infinite again, if they get too close.


4) Lee Chaolan V.S. expert players (human)
It is quite pointless to provide a guide for Lee V.S. characters controlled
by human.  It is simply because different people can play so differently
with the same character.  Keep up the variety though, and don't be
predictable, and you can surprise many, so try to be unpredictable with your
moves.

Adjust your style to meet your opponents.  Mix up attacks to confuse your
opponent.  Also a lot of players do not block low very well. You can dash in
and do the Low-High combo and maybe sweep them again when they are down.


Some ideas of how to vary your opening (TK2 chess?)
1)  F+2,2,2
2)  4,3,43)  try 1+4,3 (not V.S. button smasher)
3)  back off (b,b)
4)  backflip (b,b,N+3+4)
5)  try d+4,4,4,4
6)  dash forward (f,f) and throw opponent
7)  try jump kick (f,f,f+3)


H) Lee Chaolan in Tekken 1
-----------------------------

Unselectable except on PSX version.  Kazuya's sub-boss.
Basically most of his attacks in two were in the PSX version of one.
