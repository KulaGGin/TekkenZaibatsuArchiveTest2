Introduction:
-------------
        This is my first attempt to write a FAQ.  Maybe there are many 
mistakes in it (I hope not).  If you find any of them, feel free to send me   
the corrections.  Of course I'll give you full credit, my email address:
"WLBA00A@Prodigy.com".  Enough BS, let's go to the business!  Bruce is a very   
useful and powerful character, he has many moves that make tremendous damage,
included the infamous multi-parts throws (which can takes off maximum 70% 
damage!).


-----------------------------------
General description of BRUCE IRVIN:
-----------------------------------
        Bruce is the sub-boss of Lei, I think every Lei-player/expert had beat
him (I was one of them) if you have finished the game.  I was impressed by his 
kick-boxing style, so I decided to use him for just one game, just one game, I  
said to myself.  However, in that "one" game, I realized and discovered many 
interesting things about him, that is his cheesy combos, the correct ways of 
using multi-parts throws, etc.  Believe it or not, Bruce can beat DEVIL nearly  
perfect, in TWO rounds!  I'm not kidding, and Bruce is a good player to use   
against human opponents, too.

Bruce's throws:
---------------
        Well, there isn't much to say about his throws except the multi-parts.
Embracing right knee(f,d,D/F+1+2+4) is the initiation of all multi-parts, just 
do the Dragon Punch motion and press 1+2+4, Bruce will duck and step in to 
catch the opponent, since most multi-parts required you to press three buttons
together, it is not easy to do as Nina's and King's( both required to press
two buttons together), therefore practice is necessary to pull out Bruce's  
successive multi-parts.  Because of that, I prefer the Tumbleweed multi-parts,
though it is two-hit, but it takes off about 50% of life!  And the motion is
easy:  f,d,D/F+1+2+4 --> grab the opponent --> press 1+2 repeatedly --> Bruce
will hit his opponent by his right knee and then throw the opponent to another
side far far away.  This multi-parts works 95%, even Kazuya and Devil can also
be thrown!  Besides, this throw can be followed up by many deadly and cheesy
strategy (details in below sections).    

----------------
moves' analysis:
----------------

1+2             Sledgehammer 

Bruce jumps up and hit the opponent's head, the damage is good, but you need
to find a suitable gap to perform this move, do this move when opponent is 
ducked or is stunned or is recovering from slow moves, and remember, this move 
should be performed in a pretty close distance.

b,b,N+3+4, [4]  Handspring Escape, [Bazooka Leg]

This is a very cool move, Bruce did a back handspring, and if you hit 4,  
Bazooka Leg will come out after his handspring, notice that the [4] is an   
optional input, therefore it can fool some opponents (human), for instance,
do the first move (b,b,N+3+4), your opponent will probably step in to hit you, 
when you see they are approaching, hit 4, they'll be hit because they are  
totally off-guard.  On the other hand, when you see they didn't move or step
back, then don't hit 4, because the Bazooka Leg won't hit them and you'll be 
in danger.

d/f+3,1         Cyclone Edge, Tornado Uppercut

This is another cool move, Bruce did a low sweep and then connected with an
jump-up uppercut (I think this move is translated from SFseries, the sweep 
just like the sweep of Adon in SFA, and the uppercut is exactly the dragon  
punch of Ryu/Ken).  Like the uppercuts of Kazuya, the uppercut made great  
damage, and sometimes it stunned opponent when they block it too close!  But
overall this is a slow move, when you fight against quick characters(Nina, Jun
, Michelle, Law, etc.), it is unwise to use this move, they'll hit you before  
you do the uppercut!

f,f,f+3         Sniper Slash

Just like other characters' f,f,f+3 move, this is a running jump-kick, which
will stun the opponent when they blocked it.  This is one of the effective
moves of Bruce's fighting strategy.

3,3             Quick Kicks

What's the special thing about this move?  Its name mentioned it, it is a 
quick move, do this move when opponents were initiating some slow move or when 
they are stunned.

F+1,2,1         Triple Sock Combo

Bruce punches three high punch, the last punch will smash the opponent away.
Slow recovery, use it when opponent is off-guard.

3,2,1,4         Gatling Combo

*Important*  This combo is the key of victory, kinda like Lei's f,N+1,2,1,2,3
combo, though CPU opponents can block the first three hits, but they usually 
can't block the last sweep(4), they'll be knocked down, follow it with a (D+3) 
, then step back and use other strategies to attack your opponent.


1,2, (N or d or f)+4    1-2punch, (middle or low or high) Kick
1,2,3           Northern Lights Combo
1,4,3           Southern Cross Combo

Three combos above are useful combos, mix them with (3,2,1,4), which can
confused your opponent.    


B+2+3           Sidewinder (Unblockable)

Bruce's unblockable move, the range is three to four steps, setup time is 3
seconds, the damage isn't good enough so I don't use it often.


--------------------------------
General Strategy of BRUCE IRVIN:
--------------------------------

At the beginning of each round, you can usually get a free throw, I suggest 
to do the Embracing right knee --> Tumbleweed (f,d,D/F+1+2+4 --> 1+2,1+2,1+2).
It takes off approximately 50% of life, it gives you a big majority already, 
right?  When the Tumbleweed finished, your opponent will be thrown far away 
from you, don't hesitate, do the Sniper Slash (f,f,f+3) immediately, another
method is to run (f,f,F) towards your laying opponent, when you see your 
opponent begin to get up, press 3, you may either hit them or stunned them 
if they blocked, if they blocked the move, just quickly tap 4, If they block
it again, you'll have enough time to escape (step back:b,b), or they'll be
just hit by your 4.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****************
*Winning Pattern*
*****************
As I said, the Gatling Combo (3,2,1,4) is key to win, here's how it works: 

1)perform the move (3,2,1,4) in middle to close distance;
2)opponent will be knocked down by the last sweep;
3)step forward and D+3;
4)a)step back and repeat the (3,2,1,4) again; or
  b)step back and do the (f,f,f+3), hit 4 quickly if they blocked it.  Step 
    back to middle distance and repeat step 1) again.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you are in close distance with your opponent, besides the (3,2,1,4) combo
,you can also use the punch combos or combos start with punches:
-1,2,1,2
-F+1,2,1
-1,2,(N or d or f)+4 
-1,4,3
-1,2,3
These combos work best with human opponents, they really made them dizzy.  But
for CPU opponents, I prefer to use the (3,2,1,4) combo.


-------------------
BRUCE IRVIN VS CPU:
-------------------

VS HEIHACHI: 
f,f,f+3 always hit him, use it often, beware of his Hell sweep and the 
annoying dragon punch.  When close, he'll always do a standing back right kick   
, block it and retaliate with (3,2,1,4) and the winning pattern.

VS PAUL:
Paul is easy.  Step at least three steps away from him.  Just wait for him to 
do the falling leaf combo, the sweep can't hit you because you are out of the 
range, but you'll block the rushing elbow and then start the winning pattern!

VS JACK:
This big guy will do his scissors punches all the round, use any combos to 
stop him.  And don't forget to use the winning pattern.  

VS KING:
King is a danger character.  Remember to duck when he tried to grab you for
multiparts, and block his Ali kicks low.  After he finished the 
Frankensteiner, sweep him (D+3) and do (3,2,1,4) combo when he gets up.

VS YOSHIMITSU:
He loved to do the stupid, slow turning kicks, just duck or block the kicks, 
and start the winning pattern, the 3 in (3,2,1,4) will hit him if he dares to  
sit down or doing stupid suicide.

VS JUN:
Jun is hard, very hard.  She is fast, she'll just rush in and throw you!  So,   
you should be very alert, when you see she began to run, duck immediately.   
And add a 4 while crouching if she can't grab you.  Another strategy is to 
wait until she finished her string, then retaliate with (3,2,1,4) and the  
winning pattern.  One more thing, remember to block her cartwheel kick high, 
because it really hurts!!

VS MICHELLE:
Michelle has numerous combos, just step away (so that the moves of her combos
can't hit you), after she finished the combos, start winning pattern.  
Remember to block all her uppercut and elbow strike (so fast!) high.

VS LEI:
Lei is quite easy.  He'll keep doing the turning punch, duck and hit him with
4, or you can wait for his turning foot sweep, jumping hook kick.  Because  
you are ducking, the jumping hook kick will miss, before he recovers from the
move, you can do any combos you like.

VS KAZUYA:
Kazuya is like a nightmare, hopefully you can grab and multi-throw him at the 
beginning of the round, if you can't, don't panic, step back, find a chance to  
do (3,2,1,4), sometimes he'll block the last sweep, if he did, step back and
try it again (he won't block the last sweep all the time), remember his hell
sweeps had four hits and his dragon punch is deadly! 

VS DEVIL:
Devil is not as hard as you think, you can multi-throw him at the beginning,
and follow up by the (3,2,1,4) combo, duck the ground laser, and when he did 
the air laser, you can either run (f,f,F) behind him and throw him or hold 
the stick U/B at the moment the laser beam comes out.  Like Kazuya, his dragon
punch is dangerous and he'll run and throw you like crazy.  So don't just 
stand and let him throw you, you can duck or hit 4 when he is running to you. 
(3,2,1,4) works very good on him.
