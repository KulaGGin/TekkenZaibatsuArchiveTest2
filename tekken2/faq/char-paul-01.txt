Introduction

----------------------

When I started playing Tekken2(i had never played Tekken 1 at the time) 
I used King because he looked the coolest. However, being a VF2 only 
player then, this was not a good move. King was sort of like a demented 
Wolf, and I lost quite often. When I saw Paul I knew I would use him the 
most, as many of Paul's moves are taken from Akira(my favorite VF 
character) from VF2. I would recomend this to VF'rs who use Akira when 
learning tekken2 as well. Paul has a single jump kick, a double jump 
kick, a dashing elbow, a reversal and a few other shared moves.  Paul is 
probably a bit better than the average tekken2 character, but that is 
just my belief. Some people view Paul as weak because of long recovery 
time, while others think that he is limitlessly better than everyone 
else. All in all, it is how you use him. And I hope this faq will let 
you use him a bit better than you did before. 



Examination of Tekken2's Counter System

-------------------------------------------------------------------

It may be helpful to understand why some of your attacks are doing 
double or triple damage, and here are some of things I have noticed:


OK, I’ve only really been analyzing this with Paul, but here's how the 
counter attacks seem to work:


After blocking an attack, you can retaliate and hit the opponent while 
they are finishing up with their attack animation. This will 
occasionally cause two sets of "sparks" to appear which are sometimes 
accompanied  by an added effect. The added effect is usually extra 
damage, or the ability to do new moves etc...


With a "Major-counter" you are hitting an opponent while they are 
"winding up" to do an attack. Or, in other words, interrupting your 
opponents attack with one of your own. 

With Paul's power punch ; the player hit by it normally receives a 
certain amount of damage. When used as a counter(see above) the player 
on the receiving end loses even more life(about 30% damage on normal 
setting I believe). When used as a Major counter: massive damage is 
dealt(60 to 90 percent!), AND however gets hit by this goes flying 
backwards, tumbling 
over and over.





Another example of a major counter is Pauls d+1,2. If it is a major 
counter then there will be 2 sparks and the opponent will be stunned 
long enough to not be able to block the second half. If used as a 
regular counter, there will be two sets of sparks, but the power punch 
can be blocked.

King's 5-Ali kicks/octopus grab can be done as regular counters as well 
as major ones.


Contact me if you have something to add to this section. Better yet, 
check out the Tekken2 

counter faq. I don’t who wrote it, or where to get it, but it is good.

Here is how the connotation of joystick movements and button presses 
works:



d,u,f,b (*tap* stick down, up, toward opponent, away from opponent)


D,U,F,B (*HOLD* stick down, up, toward opponent, away from opponent)


d/f,d/b,u/f, etc (tap stick diagonally)


D/F,D/B,U/F, etc (HOLD stick diagonally)


N (return stick to Neutral position)


QCT Quarter-Circle Towards (circle stick from down to forward)


HCT Half-Circle Towards) (circle stick from back to down to forward)


(WC), While Crouching

(WS), While Standing


A tilde (~) between two buttons means to press the second


 one IMMEDIATELY after the first.

COMMON MOVES

--------------------------

Before we take a closer look at the special moves, lets first check out 
some of the moves common to all characters.





Uppercut  (d/f+2)

---------------

This can also be done with d/f+1, but you need to use RP to get them in 
the air for a float. This along with Right Jump Kick(u/f+4) are the best 
moves to start float combos with Paul. The Range on this move is very 
limited however.



SideKick (d/f+3)

---------------

Maybe the most underused move in Pauls arsenal. This kick is almost 
uncounterable when done from its farthest reach. It is quick and can 
surprise a crouching opponent, it also is good for mixing up attacks, 
just don’t expect to float or stagger people with it ;)



Punch (1 or 2)

-----------

The only real use for using a punch alone is to float opponents when
they are in mid-air. Sometimes, however, you can use a single
punch to finish off a opponent who is almost KO'd without fear 
of counter(but not reversal).



Kick (3 or 4)

---------

Kicking with LK knocks them down. Paul's Right kick is rather
useless IMO.



Toe Kick(d/f+4)

-------------

Short Range



Rising Toe Kick (WS+4)

--------------

Doesn’t knock them down. Can be done out of the crouching dash(d,d/f,f)


Hop Jump Kick (u/f+3 or u/f+4)

-----------------------

Start float combos with u/f+RK, but watch out for reversals or counters! 
His u/f+LK is another rarely used move, but can be followed by a RK for 
an instant double jump kick.



Big Jump Kick (U/F+3 or U/F+4)

------------------------

These high kicks look silly and can be used to humiliate your

opponent!  ;)



Flying Punch! (U/F,1)

--------------------

The most useless stupid move in the game IMHO! No one uses this. If

you get hit by this, hang your head in shame.  :)



Run (f,f,f)

--------

Rush in on a far away enemy.



Slide (4 after running for a while)

----------

This attack hits people lying on the ground as tripping anyone who is
not guarding low. This is good follow up to any attack that puts Paul
and his opponent far away from each other such as the Shoulder Ram. This
move also puts you in a lying position.



Tackle (Run into a standing opponent)

-----------

The same tackle as Pauls Ultimate Tackle(d/b+1+2). After tackling, press
1,2,1,2,1 to punch them in the head. Or try his chain 
throw(D+2,1,1,N+4,1,1+2).



Shoulder Ram (Run into a moving opponent)

-----------------------

This is what usually occurs when the person getting ran at tries to 
resist a tackle. Does a lot of damage.



Running Stomp (Run through an opponent who is lying down)

------------------------

Another good humiliation move! Use this when far away and your opponent 
is slow  at getting up. 



Hop Pounce (u+2)

-------------------

A light pounce that is relatively quick but does little damage. Only use 
this when you are inches away from an opponent and they are JUST about 
to get up(ex. after knocking down someone with a standing LK).

Otherwise, use Paul's ground punch(d+2) instead.



 High Pounce (U+2)

----------------------

Paul jumps really high and lands his fist on a lying opponent with
a punch. These are Rarely used in Tekken2 and any opponent can get up
to avoid this. Unlike other characters, Paul cannot follow up ANY move 
with a high Pounce with any reliability.



RISING ATTACKS (Use these after being knocked down)



Rising Kicks (<when lying down> 3 or 4)

---------------------

LK is a rising low kick and RK brings out a rising high kick. Do not use 
these against good players! You will always be countered!



Spring up Palm (<lying down> B+3+4)

-------------------------

Paul takes a long time to get up halfway, and then spring at you with 
arms extended. This move is slow but hard for an opponent to hit you out 
of. Use this occasionally if your opponent is always trying to hit you 
when you stand up.



Roll and Spring at 'em (<lying down> 1 or B or both, then F+1+2)

----------------------------------

Try rolling back(B) and then spring at them. This will surprise even 
expert players if you use it sparingly. 



Remember that you can do "get up combos" of sorts. While lying down, 
press 2 to recover. Before you stands up, press 1 to roll into the 3rd 
dimension. Then hold back on the joystick to roll backwards. Before Paul 
finishes this, press f+1+2 to spring at them! Mix up how you get up and 
you may surprise a few people!!



PAUL PHOENIX SPECIAL MOVES ANALISYS

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Well, this is the long part. 



SOMMERSAULT KICK (f,f+4)

--------------------------------------

In Tekken 1, this move could be used VERY cheesily(is that even a 
word?).

Thankfully you now recover in time to block or dodge another attack 
after the somersault hits you while you are blocking. Thus, this move 
has lost a lot of its power.

Paul is vulnerable while executing this move. You can occasionally hit
people with this as they get up. It can also be used to get in close 
with someone. When someone blocks this, you(Paul) are stunned longer 
than them. Remember this.



Jump Kick Strings 

(u/f+3[First Kick],4[2nd kick] OR f,f+3[Singlee jump kick],4[Double Jump 
kick],4[3rd Kick])

----------------------------                                          
TRIPLE KICK STRING



It may be easier to execute u/f+3,4 ; but you cannot add a 3rd kick to 
that. The f,f+3 motion also allows you to dash in before kicking. Just 
press forward once and hold the second forward a second before kicking. 
This technique increases your range and is needed to do some of Paul's 
float combos. The 3rd kick in the THREE KICK STRING can be a high kick 
(by simply pressing RK), a low kick(press down+RK) or a side kick(press 
d/f+4). It is a powerful technique to always finish your 3 kick string 
with down and RK. This will force your opponent to crouch before every 
3rd hit. This leaves them vulnerable to the sidekick now!



It should also be noted that these kicks hit crouching opponents. 
Sometimes it is useful to use his kick strings when opponent thinks you 
are going to throw him.

You can also do this 3 kick string while running! In other words, 
f,f,f(let Paul run for a while if you wish),3,4,4



After connecting with the first 2 kicks in the 3 kick string, always run 
in and ground punch! It works 100% and the extra damage is nice. The 3rd 
kick in the 3 kick string is should mostly be used only if the first 2 
are missed or blocked.



Death Fist aka Super Punch (d,d/f,f+2)

------------------------------------------

Pauls most powerful move. Pauls Power Punch has varied effects ;



As a regular hit - Takes off about 23% of opponents life.

When used as counter(blocking attack and retaliating in time) - even 
more life taken off. When used as Major Counter(interrupting opponents 
attack) - Does a HUGE amount of damage (roughly 68% on regular damage 
setting) and sends however hit by it tumbling head over heels, far away 
from you. Use this large distance gap to run at the person after they've 
been hit( See running moves above).



Notice that Paul takes a crouching dash before you hit RP with this 
move. You can punch right at the start of the dash by hitting the button 
right after the joystick motion. Or you an delay the power punch by 
waiting a little, or d,d/f,f,pause,RP.  Switching your timings with the 
power punch can fool your opponent. It is advised that you do the late 
power punch as much as you can. This will make other players more likely 
to try to interrupt your Death Fist. That is when you bring out for 
quick power punch for a Major Counter and the most Powerful Single move 
in the game!  See the Crouching Dash section below for more reasons to 
release the death fist late.



It should be noted that the crouching dash that precedes the Power Punch 
is actually a move by itself(d,d/f,f). Other uses for this technique 
will be mentioned later in the faq.





Tile Splitter (d+1 or WC[While crouching]+1)

-----------------

This move is most commonly associated with the Tile Splitter, Death Fist 
combo(see ground combos). However, it is a power full move in itself. 
This Move has 3 Different effects:



Regular Hit - Paul smashes his opponent for relatively low damage. 
Nothing can be added on after this for a combo

When used as a Major counter - The smash hits them harder and they are 
stunned long enough to be hit by a power punch(2 right after the Tile 
Splitter - see ground combos). There is no other known follow up to this 
attack that combos

When an opponent gets hit with this While they do not have their feet 
planted on the ground(example - while they are trying to stand up) - 
Paul smashes them into the ground! The damage is increased a little and 
the player hit by it is both lying on the ground and humiliated!



Paul has 3 options after executing the Tile splitter. 1)Do not follow up 
2)after d+1, press 2 for a death fist follow up(combos on counter hit) 
3)Press 4 to execute his turning low kick(aka 1 half falling leaf 
combo), after that you can do the death fist with RP or stop attacking. 
Look below for 1/2 falling leaf  info.



It may seem impractical to use this move alone at first, but remember 
that most players expect the death fist after it and will usually not 
counter the Tile Splitter alone. Like his other Moves, mix up your 
attacks and follow ups. For example, doing his tile splitter and then 
doing the normal deathfist (d,d/f,f+2) can match many players offguard! 

The Tile splitter can also be used to harass people when they are 
getting up. If this connects they will be smashed into the ground!



Low Turnaround Kick (aka 1/2 Falling Leaf Combo) [d+4]

-------------------------------

Pauls signature move! This is perhaps the most effective move in Pauls 
arsenal! It is very quick and can catch people off guard. And best of 
all, it hits low! (Akira could use this move :) )


Since 90% of Pauls moves have to be blocked high, this move is great! 
This move is so quick and powerful(especially when comboed with the 
elbow or deathfist) that most people try to play Paul out of its range. 
If you play a close-in game with Paul, this move is essential. Stick 
this move in whenever you can and follow it up with the elbow. Don’t 
over use it though. But if you do, and you find that every one is crouch 
defending you ; hit them with a tile splitter, death fist, Jumping kick 
string, elbow or whatever you just about want!



This move can be followed up by a elbow as a floating canned combo. Just 
press 2 after executing the d+4. This is known as the falling leaf 
combo.



This move is great for hitting a rising opponent. After scoring a 
knockdown with Paul, run in and wait. If they get up with Forward or 
Back, use the falling Leaf Combo! Both hits will connect if they roll 
forward, and both hits MAY hit if they roll backwards. I guess Tekken 2 
DOES have some sort of physics engine.



ELBOW STRIKES (FC,f+2 or FC,d/f+2 or f,f+2)

-----------------------

Paul has 3 different elbows(just like Akira :) ), ill take you through 
them in the order listed above,


Crouch -> Elbow (FC,f+2)

--------------------------

This is Paul's elbow from Tekken1. It is a good move in that Paul as 
very few special moves done from a crouching position. It is best used 
to counter an attack after blocking something low. For some reason I 
never use this move in a fight. BTW, the motion may be FC,d,d/f,f+2 ill 
fix this later.



Chain Elbow (FC,d/f+2 - may be followed up with D/F+2 or D/F+1 for a 
combo)

---------------------

The only use here is to add something to the elbow. Using the elbow 
alone only gets you reduced damage. To add on an attack after this - 
from crouching position, press d/f+2, keep holding the D/F and after the 
elbow connects(or sooner) press 1 for a power punch (hits high) or 2 for 
a lifting leg toss(hits low). Mix these to attacks up to keep them 
guessing!



Flash Elbow (f,f+2)

------------------

Another important Paul move. This attack is uncounterable when blocked. 
So use it to keep your opponent in check. Hits crouching defender.



Ground Punch (d+2 while above a lying opponent) -aka Stone Splitter

-----------------------

Another very important move for Paul. You should try to use this 
whenever your opponent is lying down! Since people get up quicker in 
Tekken2, you may have to dash in (f,f) before hitting with this. 
Whenever one of your special move knocks them down, but is to far away
for the Stomp, try to get them with a ground punch. It is important to 
be efficient with this move. Use it often! Keep in mind though, that 
Paul actually has to recover from a missed ground punch.



Crouching Dash(d,d/f,f)

------------------------

This move is actually more than the beginning of the death fist. If you 
are bringing out your Death Fists late(d,d/f,f,pause,RP) you now have 
the luxury or crouch dashing in and throwing(d,d/f,f,1+3 or 2+4)! You 
can also tack on the crouch dash before any throw to triple your 
throwing range!  And don’t forget that you can stop the crouching dash 
anytime simply by push back on the joystick. Try doing the crouch dash, 
interrupt it with B, and then quickly execute the falling leaf combo. It 
is moves like these that let you play Paul in an unpredictable manner!



I believe unconventional use of this move is key to mastering Paul.



Unblockable Death Fist (B+1+2)

----------------------------------

Pauls only unblockable attack. Use it sparingly as it opens you up for a 
counter. Occasionally<sic>, you’ll connect with this. It does 90% damage 
and lets you run in and stomp( or ground punch) afterwards.





THROWING TECHNIQUES

-----------------------------------------

Shoulder Throw (1+3)

-----------------------

Pauls 1+3 throw looks like a judo mauver. He grabs their arms and flips 
them over his shoulder. Follow it up with a ground punch everytime. Use 
this more often than 2+4 because of the following ground punch.



Shoulder Popper (2+4)

-------------------------

Paul grabs their arm, sticks his leg on their chest, and straightens his 
body to pull opponents arm out of it socket while pulling the to the 
ground! You can actually hear the bone coming out! Doing this move puts 
both Paul and his opponent on the ground. Even when you get up 
quickly(tap 2 while lying down) though, the ground punch follow up can 
be avoided. So use his 1+3 for more damage(because of the ground punch 
follow-up) and use 2+4 when you want to be lying on the ground(when time 
is running out).



Try this: after connecting with this throw, roll back(B). Then try to 
surprise the other person by springing at them with f+1+2. 



Stomach Throw (1+3,B)

------------------------

Another judo-like move. Paul does something that looks like Kage's(vf2) 
Ten foot toss, but at a more horizontal angle.

Although this move is often listed as B+1+3, that will only get a 
reversal attempt out.Press 1+3 within throwing range and right after 
that, hold back. This move puts you at a great distance from the other 
player, so get up quick(tap 2) and run in for the tackle, stomp or 
ground punch. This move can supposedly be used as CPU Cheese(see 
appropriate section).



Shoulder Ram (f,f+1+2)

-----------------------

Hands Down Pauls most effective throw! I have yet to see someone break 
it! Does good damage and puts Paul and his opponent at a great distance. 
Follow this up with a run in for a tackle or running stomp.



Striking Shihi-Nage (d/f+1+2)

-----------------------------

Wow! The best looking throw in the game IMO! It looks realistic but 
painful. Paul grabs their arms and leads them on front of him. Then he 
pulls them in and smacks them to the ground with his other arm! A nice 
amount of damage and i still have not seen this throw broken.



Ultimate Tackle (d/b+1+2) to break the tackle, press B+2+4 while Paul 
touches you

------------------------

The same as his run into 'em tackle, but without the annoying run at the 
start. This move can surprise people. Follow this up with face 
Punches(1,2,1,2,1) or Pauls Ultimate Choke ( read on). Note that the 
face punches(and maybe the choke) can be reversed by another Paul.





Ultimate Choke Multi-Throw

-----------------------------------------

Pauls very own chain throw! Many people have trouble with this so;

Here is a great and easy way to do it as told by SeeThru9:



From: seethru9@aol.com (SeeThru 9)



Organization: America Online, Inc. (1-800-827-6364)



Newsgroups: rec.games.video.arcade







 "I hope this sorta makes things a little easier to understand in 
relation to Paul's choke.


 Here's how I do it, and it works every time:


 d/b+1+2 for the tackle, and immediately hold D and hit 2 once before 
Paul reaches the ground, so the face punch is inputted before the tackle 
is finished. Once Paul pulls back for the 1st punch, I continue to hold 
D and tap 1. I keep tapping 1 (not smacking, just steady, like a beat, 
to keep the time for the move), and as the 1st punch to the side 
CONNECTS (not comes out, but actually connects), I quickly do the 
N+4,1,1+2 sequence. It works for me every time this way.


 So, you input the 1st punch before the tackle is finished, keep tapping
(I repeat, don't mash the button, it's not necessary) 1, then do the 
choke as the 1st gut punch connects. I keep tapping 1, and go right into 
the sequence from that. And when I say the gut punch connects, you 
should do the N+4,1,1+2 very quickly when you see the sparks from the 
1st stomach punch, so you should have the entire sequence entered before 
the 2nd gut punch even starts.



Hope this sorta helps. It's just the way I do it, and it seems to work
fine.

"





THE REVERSALS!!! (b+1+3 or b+2+4)

---------------------------

This Move single handedly changes the gameplay elements of Paul Phoenix 
in Tekken2! See strategy section


When you do this move Paul will back off for a second, assuming a more 
defensive position for a second. You must time it so your opponents 
attack goes into this position as it starts. The reversal must be 
started about a one-fifth of a second before the attack reaches you. 



So, in other words, doing the motion opens up a "window" for about One-
fourth of a second in which a reversal occurs if a reversible attack 
enters the "window". Paul then intercepts his opponent’s attack, and 
performs some sort of mauever to attack them. The result of a successful 
reversal varies depending on the move that got reversed. Read on for 
some of those results.



There is recovery time after a missed reversal! It is brief but you are 
still open to attack. Don’t get into the habit of doing "random 
reversals". It looks silly and it is really not that hard to time a 
reversal in Tekken2. Always use reversals when your opponent becomes 
predictable. 



An ideal Paul player would be attacking(and hitting) with his moves for 
most of the match. But when the other player DOES have a chance to be 
offensive, that is where you reverse their attacks!



Lets try to name all of the reversal animations Paul does! It will help 
people know if certain moves are reversable or not, and is just good to 
know. Generally, a hop jump kick(u/f+3 or 4) can be reversed. But a High 
jump kick(U/F+3 or 4) or running jump kick(f,f,f,3) cannot be reversed. 
Just about any standing attack above the waist can be reversed(including 
unblockable). Paul cannot reverse low attacks like Akira can :(



Attack Reversed                                          Result

------------------------                                ----------------

King's Frankensteiner                                   Paul Powerbombs his
opponent!

Punch                                                   Paul uses a Judo
manuver to receive the punch
and flip his opponent over his shoulder

Kick                                                    Paul grabs the leg
and twists it, forcing them
to fall

Hopping Jump Kick                                       Like above, with
more of a spin to it

if you have more reversal animations for this section, E-Mail them to 
me. You will be given full credit ofcourse. I am espescially interested 
in hearing how Paul manages to reverse Yoshimitu's sword, as we have
few Yoshimitu's here.

   

Ultimate Escape (1+2 when tackled by someone)

-------------------------

Another neat thing about Paul. With this you can avoid damage from 
strikes to the head or  another Paul multi-throw after being tackled. 
The motion is simply 1+2, and it doesn’t need to be executed gracefully! 
Just repeatedly tap 1+2 right after being tackled and it will still 
reverse! Although you are supposedly supposed to wait just before the 
punch reaches you before pushing the buttons.  See the strategy section 
for info on using this technique to run away and let time run out. 





COMBOS

----------------



10 STRING ATTACKS *means a guard point in which the 10-string stops 
"combo'ing"

----------------------------------

1,2,3*,2,1,2,1,*4,2,1   Tenstring




This is his 10 string from tekken1. They only need to block the RK(4) 
low.



1,2,3*,1*,4,2,1,*4,2,1   Tenstring






A variation of his first string. Once again, block the 4's low.



Here are the timings for those 10 strings from Goten's 10 string timing 
faq:

 it is set up like a rythem(ie. if numbers are close together-push them 
quick):



* PAUL PHOENIX *



1232 1  2  1 4  2  1

1231  4 2 1  4  2  1



1,2,3*,1,2             Fivestring




I haven’t even used this 5-String yet! More info later...

Ill insert more 10 string info in a later version of the faq along with 
the attack animations Paul assumes while doing these strings.





Canned Combos

--------------------------

1, 2 Punch - is exactly what it sounds like! Press LP~RP for a quick 
uncounterable  weak attack



Punch Kick Combo (2,3)

  Ahhh! This doesn’t even seem to combo anymore unless it is used as a 
counter! Even worse,   its harder to run in and do this thanks to the 
flash elbow(f,f+2)! Pauls old PK combo still  knocks them down however.



Punch Low Kick (2,d+3)

  A good variation of the above combo. If you use PK alot, then use this 
once in a while to get in a  surprise hit.





Floating or Juggling Combos

-------------------------------------------



Here are some damaging juggle combos I have found with Paul. I start 
them differently on the list but Paul can start a float combo with : Right 
Jump kick(u/f+4) and right uppercut(d/f+2). You can also start combos by 
connecting with ONLY the second kick in his double jump kick(f,f+3,4).
Also, the LP floats can be substituted with d/f+1 uppercuts.


You can also start floats with ONLY his first kick in the double jump 
kick(f,f+3) but it is unnecessarily<sic> difficult.





Jump kick, LP, Double Jump kick


 (u/f+4,1, f,F+3,4)
        -use the delayed double jump kick(f,F+3,4) i stated earlier to
         get this to work. Remember that Tekken 2 doesnt let you
input the motions of a move while you 
         are doing another move unlike vf2, so do this rather quickly




Uppercut, LP, Power Punch


 (d/f+2,1, d,d/f,f+2)     -note that using a power punch in a float
                           combo reduces the power punch's damage




Jump Kick, LP, Falling Leaf Combo


 (u/f+4,1,d+4,2)          -you may have to dash in after the LP





Uppercut,LP,1-2 punch combo


 (d/f+2,1,1~2)            -like before, dash in after LP





Jump kick,LP,Big Jump Kick


 (u/f+4,1,U/F+4)          -looks kind of stupid, but fun to do





Uppercut,1-2 punch combo,3rd of 3 kick string(low kick)


 (d/f+2,1~2,f,f+3,4,d+4)  -the last kick will scrape them on the ground, 
                           getting extra damage as counter if they try
                           to get up with an attack





Elbow, Lifting leg toss, Falling leaf combo


 (d,D/F+2,2,d+4,2)        -start the falling leaf combo(d+4,2) as they 
				   hit the ground. coolest looking Paul
float 
				   imho



Jump Kick, LP, Tile Splitter

 (u/f+4,1,D+1)              -another humiliation combo. This smashes 
				     your opponent into the ground!



Here is an advanced combo from rgva'er Son Goku

> f/d+2,1,f,1,2,3,1,4,2,1,4,2,1 - Son Goku's Token Saving Double Float
> Combo of Death. (The SGTSDFCoD is by far the most difficult float to
> date timing wise. When done correctly the 3,1 will miss the falling
> opponent but the 4 will bounce him right off the ground up into the
> rest of the combo.)






STRATEGIES

----------------------



Vs CPU (CPU cheeze)

-------------

I personally do not play the computer. I’ve only tried about a dozen 
times and it doesn’t seem like much fun. In fact, if there’s no one on 
the tekken2 machine, I just look for vf2. Other people however DO play 
the CPU alot. There are many ways of beating the CPU easily(cheesily). 
One such is from rgva. It involves doing the 1+3,B toss and following it 
up with his Unblockable(B+1+2). I have not personally tried this (read 
above) but some claim to have beaten the entire game with it. 



Another commonplace method is knocking down the computer's player and 
waiting near them to get up. As soon as they get up dash back. The CPU 
will go for a rising attack and you can counter it with an attack of 
choice. I prefer the deathfist as it knocks them down and the process 
can be repeated.



One thing i have noticed is that you can often bait the CPU into 
attacking into your reversal. Try a quick move such as a sidekick or 
punch. After the CPU blocks it will often retaliate with a reversible 
attack. Reverse this!
